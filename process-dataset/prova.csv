"If your visitors might consider using your bathroom or lavatory, some fresh towels and a plentiful supply of toilet tissue would be appreciated.  Do some shopping to get extra groceries, cutlery, napkins etc and if necessary some extra chairs.  ;  , A position where everyone will be facing each other and at the same time the TV, if any. Many people have visitors come into their home for a specific activity, such as a book meeting, a meal, to discuss family business, etc, if television is not part of the planned active of your visitors, don't make it the focal point if your entertaining space. If you have invited a lot of visitors, get more armchairs, sofas or chairs and arrange them properly so that you need not panic at the sight of too many visitors at the last moment.  Take your cleaning supplies, use them and clear out unwanted mess.  Dust the furniture. Sweep all the corners, nooks and crannies of the house. Go a step further and use a vacuum cleaner if you have ones and flooring than be cleaned using one. Mop the floors of your house that can be mopped well and ensure you do so hours before the visitors arrive so that dirt does not accumulate before they arrived and it shall still look clean. Wash out carpets, curtains, mats, cushion covers, table clothes etc and dry them well. Be sure to leave enough time for carpets you was to dry. This can take several hours.  Arrange all the books neatly in the bookshelf according to each category like fiction, non-fiction etc so that your visitors can have access to the books whenever they wish if reading is likely to happen. If your visitors have come round to discuss great Aunt Violet's funeral, there's not likely to be much reading going on.  There may be lot of changes in the plans of arrangement according to the weather  If there's cold weather, get some fire logs and arrange the fireplace neatly. Get warm blankets and spread them on the sofas and armchairs(optional). If there is a heater in the room, switch it on half an hour before so that the cold visitors come to a warm and cozy home. You may like to put your central heating on throughout your home.  If its a hot weather, switch on the ACs and fans to keep the room cool. Remove any blankets or too warm cushions from the sofas. Just add one or too cushions for each sofa. Keep a bowl of mint chocolates for the visitors to suck on if they feel too hot, mint chocolates are considered to be extraordinarily cooling by some. Provide a bowl for your visitors to spot the mint chocolates out into when they're done sucking on them.  Don't use heavy wall paper, dense fabric wall hangings and imposing pictures. Add a flower vase or two, keep your family photos on the shelves or on the tables neatly, change curtains(optional), drape the armchairs and sofas with a clean and attractively designed cloth so that if a child spills juice on the sofa mistakenly, the cloth will take the damage.(optional).

"Congruent triangles are ones that have three identical sides. Designate the legs of length a and b and hypotenuse of length c. The Pythagorean Theorem states that the sum of squares of the two legs of a right triangle is equal to the square of the hypotenuse, so we need to prove a2 + b2 = c2.  Remember, the Pythagorean Theorem only applies to right triangles.;  , With the triangles placed in this way, they will form a smaller square (in green) inside the larger square with four equal sides of length c, the hypotenuse of each triangle.The larger square has sides of length a+b.  You can rotate (turn) the entire arrangement by 90 degrees and it will be exactly the same. You can repeat this as many times as you like. This is only possible because the four angles at the corners are equal.  Again, the larger square will have sides of length a+b, but in this configuration there are two rectangles (in grey) of equal size and two smaller squares within the larger square. The larger of the smaller squares (in red) has sides of length a, while the smaller square (in blue) has sides of length b.The hypotenuse of the original triangles is now the diagonal of the two rectangles formed by the triangles.  In both cases, you have a large square with sides of a+b. Given this, the areas of both of the large squares are equal. Looking at both arrangements, you can see that the total area of the green square must equal the areas of the red and blue squares added together in the second arrangement.  In both arrangements we partially covered the surface with exactly the same amount, four grey triangles that didn't overlap. This means that also the area left out by the triangles must be equal in both arrangements.  Therefore, the area of the blue and the red square taken together must be equal to the area of the green square.  The blue area is a2, the red area, b2 and the green area, c2. The red and blue squares must be added together to equal the area of the green square; therefore, blue area + red area = green area: a2 + b2 = c2.This finishes the proof.  ","draw four congruent right triangles. arrange the triangles so that they form a square with sides a+b. rearrange the same four triangles such that they form two equal rectangles inside a larger square. recognize that the area not formed by the triangles is equal in both arrangements. set the areas of each arrangement equal to each other.

"If you are a youth, you can benefit from being helped with speech issues at home. Working with your parents is often more comfortable than working with a stranger, so this method may remove the pressure. Even adults can benefit from practicing their speech in a familiar environment.  Speak slowly and calmly. If stuttering is caused by thinking you have to hurry while talking, it can help to speak slower and pause in the places where punctuation marks are in sentences.  Talk openly about your stutter with loved ones. It’s not something to be ashamed of or hide, but something you can work on., Many adults and children benefit from the help of speech therapy. Seeking the help of a speech specialist may teach them how to adjust the way they communicate, which may ultimately stop or decrease the amount of stuttering.  A speech pathologist may help you to stop stuttering by working with you to slow down your rate of speech. They may also encourage you to learn to say words differently, or in a more relaxed manner. Speech therapy may also help you adjust your breathing, which could result in a decrease in your stuttering., Cognitive behavioral therapy can be helpful for adolescents and adults to eliminate stuttering. The therapist often works with the patient to help you overcome anxieties that may cause the speech disorder. It may also help you change the way you think and speak.  Electronic devices that provide delayed auditory feedback may help you with the stuttering. They require patients to slow down their speech or the speech they hear will come back distorted. Another type mimics the speech of the person wearing it so that is sounds like they are speaking in unison with another person.  ","practice at home. work with a speech language pathologist. seek help from a therapist. "
"It would be a good idea to start a rough draft to begin with so you can get all your ideas scribbled down so none of your ideas slip away from you. That will help with your organization when you start to write.  Write down what your inspirations are and keep a journal of your thoughts. It will help you get to where you are used to writing all the time.  This will help you decide what you want to do your story on. Whether it's action, drama, romance, fantasy, biographies, or nonfiction, I'm sure you will find the right genre for you.  Something happens or you think of something that could play apart in your story but you can't write it down. This is why you should carry a journal and pencil with you. That will help you get more material for the start of your story when you begin to write it.  Every story needs a plot and characters as well as the main character. This is where your imagination plays a part. You need structure after you do your rough draft and creating your characters in the beginning will let you know what direction to go in.  Let the story write itself. If you start to stress over it, walk away and cool off. If you write when you're stuck or upset, it could vary the outcome. Don't get me wrong; some good stories are written with varied emotions but when you first start your story, you want to play it out easy and gradually alter the emotion.  Play it like a movie so you can visualize the detail so when you begin to start your story you can describe the detail like you saw it in your head.  Get your inspirations, creativity, imaginations and scribbled on journal paper and begin to write. Let the words go where they go, remember you can always go back and change it; it's not set in stone, so don't be afraid to take risks. After you start your story and put all your ideas in story format, read it!! After you have conquered the beginning of your story you can add on to it. After you get the hang of that, try to put a little more structure and thought into your story through the rest of it.  ","be familiar with your punctuations and writing format. get a notebook or journal. find out what genre of writing you like. keep your journal and a pencil with you. know your characters. it's always best not to try too hard. play your story inside your head. gather all of your ideas and drafts.

"A healthy store-bought mix is great for a hamster's wellbeing. However, hamster's need fresh fruits and vegetables in addition to their regular food.  Non-starchy root vegetables and leafy greens are great for your hamster. Try carrots, squash, broccoli, cauliflower, cucumber, lettuce, and spinach. Always wash any produce before serving it to your hamster.In terms of fruit, go for apples, pears, bananas, and berries. Provide your hamster only small servings of fruit. Never give a hamster citrus fruit, like lemons or oranges. They can be toxic to hamsters., In addition to fruits and vegetables, hamsters need the healthy fats found in seeds and nuts. Add things like sunflower seeds, cashews, almonds, and mixes of various seeds and nuts to your hamster's diet.Hamsters tend to eat nuts and seeds fast because they're drawn to fattier foods. You may be tempted to give your hamster more sunflower seeds because he seems to like them, but seeds are higher calorie in content. Stick to feeding your hamster nuts in moderation and do not feed him more simply because he finishes a serving., If you choose a high-quality hamster food, your hamster should get all the vitamins and nutrients he needs. However, many hamster owners grind up vitamins and mix them into their hamster's food. This might help your hamster have better overall health. If you're concerned about your hamster getting all his necessary nutrients, look for vitamin, mineral, and calcium supplements safe for rodents at your local pet store.  ","add additional fruit and vegetables. add seeds and nuts. consider dietary supplements. "
"Your Boston Terrier's eye might look milky or white if he has corneal dystrophy. At first, only the corner of your dog's cornea might look white, but it can quickly spread so that the whole cornea looks thick and white. The cornea may also look swollen with fluid.Boston terriers inherit this condition where fluid builds up between the layers of cells in the corneal. Eventually, painful ulcers on the eye develop., Since corneal dystrophy will begin to affect your dog's vision, take him to the vet as soon as you suspect he has the eye problem. The vet will do a thorough examination and will look at your dog's eyes under a slit-lamp (a microscope with a bright light). The vet will look for thickening of the cornea, ulcers, and inflammation in the eye.The vet will also check your dog's eye pressure to rule out other eye conditions.  Unfortunately, there is no effective treatment for the milkiness of corneal dystrophy. Your vet will try to treat the secondary corneal ulcers caused by the corneal dystrophy since these are painful and can damage eye health.Your dog will probably need antibiotic eye cream to treat the ulcers.  The vet may suggest placing a contact lens over your dog's eye or doing surgery to graft tissue over the eye. Another surgery is available that lifts the flap of the eyeball and back of the eyeball to treat corneal dystrophy.Surgery can prevent ulcers, but it may cause scarring that can damage your dog's vision.  If your dog doesn't have ulcers and you notice he's in pain, see the vet immediately. Ulcers may be forming.  ","look for signs of corneal dystrophy. get a medical diagnosis. treat secondary ulcers. consider surgery. "
"Dozens of Native American tribes and other cultures have their own smudging ceremonies, and each one has its own traditions concerning which plants to use. Sage is probably the most common choice, and is especially important for the Cheyenne and other Great Plains cultures. While many cultures consider white sage to be excellent at driving away bad spirits or energies, other varieties are commonly used as well.;  , Cedar is another plant often burned in cleansing ceremonies, especially in the Pacific Northwest or Canada. Note that some trees referred to as 'cedars' are actually juniper trees, which some tribes use in smudging and some do not.While many people now mix multiple herbs together, the practice is not supported by some Native American elders.Again, there are many different smudging ceremonies, and some of them may call for sweetgrass or a different plant instead of sage or cedar. Follow this advice to perform an effective and respectful ceremony if you have not been taught a specific culture's tradition.  Sweetgrass, or holy grass, is a sacred plant across North America, and is often considered to represent kindness and please spirits.It is sometimes burned after the sage or cedar have cleared away negative energy.  If you have been taught a specific tribe's tradition that uses sweetgrass in the main ceremony, feel free to use it, or any other plant that tribe allows.  While tobacco can be added to the smudging ceremony, stick to one herb if this is your first time smudging. Instead, use tobacco as an offering before you harvest a different herb.See below for more information.  If you can, harvest these plants yourself as described in the sub-steps, preferably in as natural an environment as possible. Otherwise, obtain them from a Native American shop in person or online, to ensure the plants were treated appropriately.  Before picking the plant, many tribes thank the Creator or nature, then place or burn natural, raw tobacco as an offering.  Harvest the correct part of the cedar tree. Pick branches at eye level with green tips. Dry them and crush them into a rough powder before burning.You should not harvest sweetgrass yourself, as it is endangered in some areas.Sweetgrass is usually dried and braided before use, so try to find sustainably harvested sweetgrass braids from a Native American shop or online store., Clay or stone bowls are commonly used in smudging rituals. Abalone shells are another common container, but be aware that some Pacific Northwest tribes believe they are not appropriate for this ritual.  Bundles of herbs, called 'smudge sticks', can be made yourself or purchased pre-bundled. Some Native American elders question how traditional smudge sticks are, but they are now used even by many Native Americans., Many people use a feather or fan of feathers to waft the smoke during a smudging ceremony. In the US, eagle and hawk feathers are illegal to possess unless you belong to certain native tribes.Turkey feathers are legal, and traditionally used by some tribes in eastern North America. Do not use owl feathers, as these have different ritual purposes.It is illegal to buy wild feathers in the United States.Purchase cruelty-free feathers from farm-raised birds, or use feathers you've obtained yourself from hunting or finding them in the wild.  Keep your plants and smudging container on a space cleared for them, above the ground. A high bookshelf cleared for their use is a good choice. Do not use the herbs until they are dry, or you will fail to produce the right kind of smoke.  Many people smudge when they move into a new place or stay in a hotel room, to purify the new space. You may wish to perform a smudging ceremony after you hear bad news, or when you are preparing for a big change in your life.Smudging could also help you deal with the aftereffects of a big argument or a long illness.  Smudging is performed more frequently under certain circumstances, such as in places where other ceremonies take place, or sometimes during archaeological excavations of native remains and sacred materials.  Smudging a dorm room may be against university policy against fire use, although some U.S. institutions have changed these policies after challenges based on the First Amendment and freedom of religion.  ","use sage if you are not following a specific tradition. consider cedar instead if it grows in your area. only burn sweetgrass after the smudging ceremony is done. buy raw, natural tobacco if you want to harvest the plants yourself. obtain these plants from respectful sources. choose a natural container to hold it in, or bundle the herb into a bunch. waft the smoke with a turkey feather (optional). store the materials above waist height and let them dry. know when to smudge.

"You want your lipstick to match your clothing to some degree. The match does not have to be perfect, but something about your clothing items should match your lipstick.The simplest way to do this is to match your lipstick with your main outfit. For example, if you're wearing a red dress, opt for red metallic lips.  However, you can also choose to highlight a complimentary color in your outfit. For example, if you're wearing a black dress with pink stripes, pair this with pink lipstick. If you have an accessory of a particular color, like an orange necklace, go for orange lipstick.  Bolder metallic lips may pair better with a more feminine dress. Bold, dark red lips, for example, can be paired well with a classic black dress. If you opted for very bold metallic lips, choose a very feminine dress to match., Pinker shades often match well with floral patterns. Rose gold metallic lips, for example, may go great with a floral-patterned blouse or top.Be aware of colors as well. Try to, for example, match the pink roses in your dress with the color of your lipstick.  ","think about color when choosing clothes. pair bold colors with a feminine dress. consider floral patterns for pinker shades. "

"When you positively identify a mushroom, put it in your edible mushrooms basket. If you pick a mushroom but don’t know what it is or feel unsure about its identity, put it in the other basket., Because people often confuse mushrooms at the button stage, you should stick to picking mushrooms that have opened caps., You want to pick the edible mushrooms when they look fresh and fleshy. Cut them two inches above the ground. Put them in a basket. When you get home, put them in a closed paper bag in the refrigerator.  If they look old or decaying, leave them in the ground.  They should store for a week at home.  Be sure to dig your mushroom out in a way that leaves the base of the stalk undamaged! Do not pull it up. Replace the soil when you are done. Some mushrooms have important features, such as an easily destroyed sac, at the base of the stipe.  If you have any doubts at all about a mushroom that you have picked in the wild, toss it! Give yourself some time to learn the nuances of mushroom picking. After all, it’s not worth risking your life for a delicious meal. You are better off being cautious when it comes to eating mushrooms that you have foraged in the wild.“When in doubt, throw it out!”  If the mushroom looks good but there is something that bothers you about where you picked it, it’s not worth taking the chance!  , You may hear a number of misleading rules of thumb from people who like to hunt for wild mushrooms. However, there are no easy shortcuts to proper mushroom identification. As such, ignore the following rules of thumb:  “If an animal has nibbled the mushroom, it is fine.” This is not true.  “You can get rid of poisons by cooking the mushrooms.” This is also false. Although cooking will get rid of harmful bacteria and make edible mushrooms much more digestible, you can’t make a poisonous mushroom edible by cooking it!  “Mushrooms that smell good must be edible.” This is simply not true.  Mushrooms should be carried in paper bags or waxed paper, preferably in a rigid container. Smaller mushrooms can be kept intact by carrying them in a small, hard box. Some tackle boxes used for holding fishing flies are ideal for this purpose!  Plastic sandwich bags will turn them to unidentifiable mush.  Kneel down next to the mushroom you wish to identify. Put your nose right next to the gills of the mushroom and inhale deeply. Think of a few adjectives to describe the smell, such as sweet or smokey, and use these adjectives to start the identification process.How does your mushroom smell?  Does the mushroom smell generically fungal or phenolic?  Don’t taste the mushroom until you have finished the complete identification process.  Look at the gills on the underside of the mushroom to see whether they are clearly delineated or mushy looking. You’ll also want to look at how they connect to the stalk. The texture is also important to consider, as well as whether any liquid oozes from the gills. By asking yourself questions about the gills, you can begin the identification process:Are the gills covered by a veil of thin, felt-like, or cobwebby tissue?  See if the gills are connected to the stalk. If so, do they run down the stalk, meet it at a right angle, or barely touch it? This character, like color, can change in age!  Does your mushroom have plate-like gills under the cap surface, wrinkles, spongy tubes, or something else?  Do you see liquid oozing from the gills?  , You’ll need to take mental notes about the size, color and shape of the stalk. You’ll want to look at any characteristics of the skin covering the stalk, as well as the connection between the stalk and the gills.  Look at the size, color and shape of the stalk.  Is a stalk (stipe) present or absent?  , You’ll want to take detailed notes about the size of the cap. Then, describe any variation in the color of the cap, as well as whether there are any spots on it. Finally, the texture of the cap is important to consider, such as whether it is smooth or slimey.Ask key questions about the cap:  What is the diameter of the mushroom cap?  Are there colorful spots on the cap?  Look at the color of the cap.  What color is the flesh inside the cap?  Does your mushroom bruise when cut or crushed? What color?  , Take out your notebook. Look at your surroundings. Take detailed notes about your find in relation to the features of the landscape, such as trees, soil type, forest, other fungi, leaves, animals. These notes will help you make an accurate identification.A GPS locator is an excellent tool here!  Is the mushroom growing on dead wood, living tree, soil, moss, or something else entirely?  While fungi can form associations with many plants, trees are the most relevant to identification. If you can't tell the species of tree exactly, at least note whether conifers, hardwoods, or both are present. Which trees are present in the area?  Make a note if your mushroom is growing in a lawn, on sand, on moss, on another mushroom, or any other site of interest.  Try to get a few angles and include some of the surrounding landscape in some of the shots. When you are identifying the mushroom and consulting experts, you can compare your shots to the field guide. You can also show them to experts in order to confirm your identification.  Because the color of a mushroom’s spores is useful for identification, you could make a spore print at home. Cut off the stem of the mushroom and place the cap down on a piece of paper. Place a cup over the mushroom. Wait overnight and then remove the cup and the mushroom to see the spore print. If the mushroom is dropping spores, you will see them dusting the paper, allowing you to determine their color.If you anticipate a dark spore print, you should use white paper.  If you anticipate a white or light spore print, you should use dark paper.  If you have a sheet of glass, you can use it for the spore print.  The terms for spore color can be very precise. Chocolate brown, tobacco brown, and rusty brown are entirely different colors!  , When you get back to the picnic table or kitchen, look at the mushroom again. Use one book to identify it. Then, identify the mushroom using a second source, such as another book or article on the species., Although you may be eager to apply your mycological knowledge in the field, you should avoid jumping to any conclusions during the identification process. If you think it is an edible mushroom, examine all of its characteristics to make sure it is not a toxic look-alike.For example, Volvariella speciosa, a popular edible species in Asia, can be easily confused with Amanita phalloides, a deadly poisonous species in North America and Europe., If you see a mushroom that looks like the puffball mushrooms you are familiar with from the supermarket or television, you should skip it. Beginners are especially forewarned to avoid picking puffballs, since they can easily be confused with poisonous amanitas.The mushrooms that look most familiar to a beginner mycologist, such as puffballs, could easily be confused with a poisonous young amanita mushroom.You should also avoid the little brown mushroom, which is poisonous. It also looks a bit like the mushrooms you see in a supermarket.  Whereas a morel is perfectly hollow inside, a false morel looks like a brain on the inside. Don’t let commonalities like the dimpled appearance and the fact that they fruit at the same time confuse you. If you pick a morel, look on the inside. If it is brain-like on the inside as well as the outside, it is a false morel. , The best way to differentiate a chanterelle mushroom, which is edible, from a jack-o’-lantern, which is poisonous, is to look at the gills. A chanterelle mushroom has fake gills that run down the stem and are not easily removed from the cap. They look like they have been melted. In contrast, a jack-o’-lantern has true gills that look like little blades that don’t run down the stem.A jack-o’-lantern or false chanterelle is deep orange. In contrast, a chanterelle mushroom can be anything from light yellow or orange yellow.  Whereas jack-o’-interns grow in bunches that are attached at the stem, chanterelles like to grow alone or in small bunches and with separate stems.  One of the best ways to learn about picking wild mushrooms is to join a local mycological society. After joining, you will get invitations to forays at local parks where you can learn from experienced mushroom pickers. You may also get invited to special mushroom dinners and lectures on the science of mycology.  You will typically pay a small membership fee.  For instance, the Wisconsin mycology society has forays, lectures, dinners and workshops on mushrooms.The Mycological Society of Toronto runs forays in the spring and fall picking seasons, hosts dinners and runs lectures. It also has a quarterly newsletter called “Mycelium.” , Once you are a member of a mycological society, you will have access to mushroom identification courses.One of the best things you can do is take a day-long course that reviews the fundamentals of where to look for particular species, when to harvest different species and how to avoid poisonous look-alikes., The best way to learn how to pick mushrooms is by picking with an experienced mycologist. Go on a hike with someone who is both knowledgable and passionate about mushrooms. Pick their brain about how to safely forage for wild mushrooms.If you are part of a mycological society, you should be able to meet some fellow mushroom loving friends at one of the forays.  You should pick up at least one general book on mycology and one field guide that focuses on your particular region. Whereas the general mycology book will review the fundamentals of mushroom picking, your field guide will offer tips that are specific to the place where you want to pick them.For instance, a good introduction is How to Identify Edible Mushrooms by Tony Lion and Gill Tomblin.  Mushrooms by Roger Phillips is a good place to start.  You might be interested in Mushrooms: River Cottage Handbook No 1.  You can’t teach yourself to be a mycologist by just looking at a few images of edible mushrooms online. Rather than searching with the “images” function on your search engine, you should consult reputable books on mycology and ask experts for help with identification., To avoid picking the wrong mushroom, you should familiarize yourself with both poisonous and difficult to identify species. If you are a beginner, for instance, you should avoid picking lactarius and russula species. Read the notes in your field guide about the dangerous mushrooms in your region.Avoid poisonous species like amanita, galerina, entoloma and cortinarius.  ","forage with two baskets. avoid picking mushrooms in the button stage. pick the fleshy mushrooms. follow the golden rule. ignore misleading rules of thumb. store and transport the mushrooms safely. smell the mushroom. look at the shape and texture of the gills. examine the size and color of the stalk. take notes about the size and color of the cap. take detailed notes about the location. take a photograph of the mushroom before picking it. obtain a mushroom spore print. use multiple sources to make an identification. don’t skip any steps in the identification process. avoid picking puffballs. see the difference between a morel and a toxic false morel. don’t confuse the jack-o’-lantern with the chanterelle. join a mycological society. take a mushroom identification course. go on forays with experienced mycologists. purchase a field guide to mycology. avoid misleading information and images online. learn about dangerous mushrooms.

"Many people have jobs where they work at a desk. This is one of the main places where slouching can be at its worst. As you work throughout the day, you lean toward your computer or over your desk as you work on documents. If you sit too far forward, you put pressure on your pubic bone. If you sit too far back, you put pressure on your tailbone. In order to stop this trend, you should lean back in your chair, keeping your back flush with the chair's support.  If you feel too far away from your desk or computer, pull your chair closer or move your monitor closer to you on the desk.Adjust your computer screen such that the middle of the screen is at eye level. This can help you keep proper posture and prevent back pain.If you find yourself still slouching, try setting an alarm on your phone to remind you every hour to sit up straighter. This will help you get into the habit and you'll eventually not need the reminder., In all aspects of your life, you should sit properly to avoid muscle and back problems. You need to find a comfortable middle range where everything is aligned naturally. Sit with your feet flat on the floor and center your weight between your buttocks and pubic bone.  This goes for every place you sit. For example, make sure you are comfortable and sit straight in the car, especially if you have a long commute. Use a pillow or adjust your seat to get your back and spine aligned and centered while you drive., To assess how your posture normally is, you need to evaluate how you stand. Turn facing a mirror and stand like you normally do. If your palms face your thighs with your thumbs pointing ahead of you, you have good posture. If your hands rest ahead of your thighs or behind your thighs, or if your palms back backwards, then your posture is wrong.  If you find that your posture is off, pull back your head and pull your shoulders down and back. This will realign your spine and get your posture toward the right angle.  If you feel like your chest is popping out, you are standing correctly., Your muscles become fatigued when you still for long periods of time. Strive to get up and stretch for at least 1-2 minutes for every half hour of sitting. Stand and stretch, placing your hands against your lower back with fingers facing down. Lean back as far as you can and hold for a few seconds. Repeat a few times to get the kinks out of your back.  If you are at home, you can also lie flat on the floor with your weight on your elbows. Push your chest up, stretching out your lower back and spine.  Only do these exercises to the extent that your muscles are comfortable. Do not overextend your muscles because you don't want to cause injury., When you sleep, you can have poor posture that reflects in your normal, waking posture. If you sleep on your side, try putting a pillow between your knees to help lessen the pull on your lower back. If you sleep on your back, you can put a pillow underneath your knees to help release the tension placed on your lower back while you sleep.  Whether you sleep on you back or your side, placing a rolled up towel under your neck will allow your head and shoulders proper alignment.You should not sleep on your stomach. This position places too much strain on your neck as you sleep., There are times when you might have to carry a large load, such as a large purse, a backpack, or luggage. When you have to deal with these kinds of loads, you should try to balance the weight around as much as possible to keep strain off of your muscles and joints. If the weight is balanced, you will also be able to keep your normal, straight posture while you walk.  To help balance your loads, you should use bags that distribute the weight evenly, such as backpacks or rolling luggage., When you are at work, at home, or in the car, you can sit for too long and start to feel pain in your lower back. To help prevent this, you can make yourself a pad to place along your lower back to help keep your posture straighter. Take a towel and fold it in half and then in half again. From the long rectangle, roll it into a cylinder, making a cushy pillow to put in your chair.  If a bath towel is too big, you can try a hand towel instead. Just fold it in half once and roll it into a small pillow for your back., Relaxation techniques, such as meditation, massage therapy and yoga, can restore tired muscles. They also calm the central nervous system and combat the fatigue that invites slouching. Whether you join a new yoga class around the corner from your office or simply sit up and take a few deep, cleansing breaths, make time in your day for some relaxation to decrease muscle tension.  ","have better posture at work. sit in a better position. check yourself in the mirror. stretch when you get up. check your sleep posture. balance the weight you carry. make a lower back pad. try relaxation techniques.

"It is not a good idea to start your painting project on a surface that hasn't been thoroughly cleaned, and kitchen countertops can have years of builder on them, especially the surfaces nearest the stove.  Use an ammonia-based cleaning solution to scrub the laminate and/or ceramic tile countertops free of all dirt, grime, oil and grease. Allow the surface to dry completely.;  , Using painter's tape, cover any trim, walls or cabinets that might get dripped on or accidentally painted, and protect your floors with a drop cloth. Expending the effort on this preparation will save you a lot of time and aggravation on touch-ups and cleanups after you refinish the countertops.  Prepare the countertops with a good quality bonding primer that will improve paint adhesion, allowing the primer to dry for at least 24 hours before beginning to paint.  Ask the professionals at your home improvement store for suggestions on the best brands.  Using the color you selected, you can start to paint the countertops now that the bonding primer is completely dry. Avoid applying the paint too thickly and paint 2 or 3 thin coats instead, allowing each coat to dry between applications.  For laminate countertops, use a water-based paint. For tile countertops, use an oil-based paint.  In order to protect your painting project from chipping or scratching, use a water-based, non-yellowing polyurethane finish. Apply 3 coats of polyurethane, each coat drying before you apply the next. After the third coat has dried, wait an additional 24 hours before using your newly painted countertops.  ","begin with clean countertops. cover any areas you don't want painted. apply a bonding primer. paint the countertops. seal the paint. "
