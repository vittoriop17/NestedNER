"If your visitors might consider using your bathroom or lavatory, some fresh towels and a plentiful supply of toilet tissue would be appreciated.  Do some shopping to get extra groceries, cutlery, napkins etc and if necessary some extra chairs.  ;  , A position where everyone will be facing each other and at the same time the TV, if any. Many people have visitors come into their home for a specific activity, such as a book meeting, a meal, to discuss family business, etc, if television is not part of the planned active of your visitors, don't make it the focal point if your entertaining space. If you have invited a lot of visitors, get more armchairs, sofas or chairs and arrange them properly so that you need not panic at the sight of too many visitors at the last moment.  Take your cleaning supplies, use them and clear out unwanted mess.  Dust the furniture. Sweep all the corners, nooks and crannies of the house. Go a step further and use a vacuum cleaner if you have ones and flooring than be cleaned using one. Mop the floors of your house that can be mopped well and ensure you do so hours before the visitors arrive so that dirt does not accumulate before they arrived and it shall still look clean. Wash out carpets, curtains, mats, cushion covers, table clothes etc and dry them well. Be sure to leave enough time for carpets you was to dry. This can take several hours.  Arrange all the books neatly in the bookshelf according to each category like fiction, non-fiction etc so that your visitors can have access to the books whenever they wish if reading is likely to happen. If your visitors have come round to discuss great Aunt Violet's funeral, there's not likely to be much reading going on.  There may be lot of changes in the plans of arrangement according to the weather  If there's cold weather, get some fire logs and arrange the fireplace neatly. Get warm blankets and spread them on the sofas and armchairs(optional). If there is a heater in the room, switch it on half an hour before so that the cold visitors come to a warm and cozy home. You may like to put your central heating on throughout your home.  If its a hot weather, switch on the ACs and fans to keep the room cool. Remove any blankets or too warm cushions from the sofas. Just add one or too cushions for each sofa. Keep a bowl of mint chocolates for the visitors to suck on if they feel too hot, mint chocolates are considered to be extraordinarily cooling by some. Provide a bowl for your visitors to spot the mint chocolates out into when they're done sucking on them.  Don't use heavy wall paper, dense fabric wall hangings and imposing pictures. Add a flower vase or two, keep your family photos on the shelves or on the tables neatly, change curtains(optional), drape the armchairs and sofas with a clean and attractively designed cloth so that if a child spills juice on the sofa mistakenly, the cloth will take the damage.(optional).

"Congruent triangles are ones that have three identical sides. Designate the legs of length a and b and hypotenuse of length c. The Pythagorean Theorem states that the sum of squares of the two legs of a right triangle is equal to the square of the hypotenuse, so we need to prove a2 + b2 = c2.  Remember, the Pythagorean Theorem only applies to right triangles.;  , With the triangles placed in this way, they will form a smaller square (in green) inside the larger square with four equal sides of length c, the hypotenuse of each triangle.The larger square has sides of length a+b.  You can rotate (turn) the entire arrangement by 90 degrees and it will be exactly the same. You can repeat this as many times as you like. This is only possible because the four angles at the corners are equal.  Again, the larger square will have sides of length a+b, but in this configuration there are two rectangles (in grey) of equal size and two smaller squares within the larger square. The larger of the smaller squares (in red) has sides of length a, while the smaller square (in blue) has sides of length b.The hypotenuse of the original triangles is now the diagonal of the two rectangles formed by the triangles.  In both cases, you have a large square with sides of a+b. Given this, the areas of both of the large squares are equal. Looking at both arrangements, you can see that the total area of the green square must equal the areas of the red and blue squares added together in the second arrangement.  In both arrangements we partially covered the surface with exactly the same amount, four grey triangles that didn't overlap. This means that also the area left out by the triangles must be equal in both arrangements.  Therefore, the area of the blue and the red square taken together must be equal to the area of the green square.  The blue area is a2, the red area, b2 and the green area, c2. The red and blue squares must be added together to equal the area of the green square; therefore, blue area + red area = green area: a2 + b2 = c2.This finishes the proof.  ","draw four congruent right triangles. arrange the triangles so that they form a square with sides a+b. rearrange the same four triangles such that they form two equal rectangles inside a larger square. recognize that the area not formed by the triangles is equal in both arrangements. set the areas of each arrangement equal to each other.

"If you are a youth, you can benefit from being helped with speech issues at home. Working with your parents is often more comfortable than working with a stranger, so this method may remove the pressure. Even adults can benefit from practicing their speech in a familiar environment.  Speak slowly and calmly. If stuttering is caused by thinking you have to hurry while talking, it can help to speak slower and pause in the places where punctuation marks are in sentences.  Talk openly about your stutter with loved ones. It’s not something to be ashamed of or hide, but something you can work on., Many adults and children benefit from the help of speech therapy. Seeking the help of a speech specialist may teach them how to adjust the way they communicate, which may ultimately stop or decrease the amount of stuttering.  A speech pathologist may help you to stop stuttering by working with you to slow down your rate of speech. They may also encourage you to learn to say words differently, or in a more relaxed manner. Speech therapy may also help you adjust your breathing, which could result in a decrease in your stuttering., Cognitive behavioral therapy can be helpful for adolescents and adults to eliminate stuttering. The therapist often works with the patient to help you overcome anxieties that may cause the speech disorder. It may also help you change the way you think and speak.  Electronic devices that provide delayed auditory feedback may help you with the stuttering. They require patients to slow down their speech or the speech they hear will come back distorted. Another type mimics the speech of the person wearing it so that is sounds like they are speaking in unison with another person.  ","practice at home. work with a speech language pathologist. seek help from a therapist. "
"It would be a good idea to start a rough draft to begin with so you can get all your ideas scribbled down so none of your ideas slip away from you. That will help with your organization when you start to write.  Write down what your inspirations are and keep a journal of your thoughts. It will help you get to where you are used to writing all the time.  This will help you decide what you want to do your story on. Whether it's action, drama, romance, fantasy, biographies, or nonfiction, I'm sure you will find the right genre for you.  Something happens or you think of something that could play apart in your story but you can't write it down. This is why you should carry a journal and pencil with you. That will help you get more material for the start of your story when you begin to write it.  Every story needs a plot and characters as well as the main character. This is where your imagination plays a part. You need structure after you do your rough draft and creating your characters in the beginning will let you know what direction to go in.  Let the story write itself. If you start to stress over it, walk away and cool off. If you write when you're stuck or upset, it could vary the outcome. Don't get me wrong; some good stories are written with varied emotions but when you first start your story, you want to play it out easy and gradually alter the emotion.  Play it like a movie so you can visualize the detail so when you begin to start your story you can describe the detail like you saw it in your head.  Get your inspirations, creativity, imaginations and scribbled on journal paper and begin to write. Let the words go where they go, remember you can always go back and change it; it's not set in stone, so don't be afraid to take risks. After you start your story and put all your ideas in story format, read it!! After you have conquered the beginning of your story you can add on to it. After you get the hang of that, try to put a little more structure and thought into your story through the rest of it.  ","be familiar with your punctuations and writing format. get a notebook or journal. find out what genre of writing you like. keep your journal and a pencil with you. know your characters. it's always best not to try too hard. play your story inside your head. gather all of your ideas and drafts.

"A healthy store-bought mix is great for a hamster's wellbeing. However, hamster's need fresh fruits and vegetables in addition to their regular food.  Non-starchy root vegetables and leafy greens are great for your hamster. Try carrots, squash, broccoli, cauliflower, cucumber, lettuce, and spinach. Always wash any produce before serving it to your hamster.In terms of fruit, go for apples, pears, bananas, and berries. Provide your hamster only small servings of fruit. Never give a hamster citrus fruit, like lemons or oranges. They can be toxic to hamsters., In addition to fruits and vegetables, hamsters need the healthy fats found in seeds and nuts. Add things like sunflower seeds, cashews, almonds, and mixes of various seeds and nuts to your hamster's diet.Hamsters tend to eat nuts and seeds fast because they're drawn to fattier foods. You may be tempted to give your hamster more sunflower seeds because he seems to like them, but seeds are higher calorie in content. Stick to feeding your hamster nuts in moderation and do not feed him more simply because he finishes a serving., If you choose a high-quality hamster food, your hamster should get all the vitamins and nutrients he needs. However, many hamster owners grind up vitamins and mix them into their hamster's food. This might help your hamster have better overall health. If you're concerned about your hamster getting all his necessary nutrients, look for vitamin, mineral, and calcium supplements safe for rodents at your local pet store.  ","add additional fruit and vegetables. add seeds and nuts. consider dietary supplements. "
"Your Boston Terrier's eye might look milky or white if he has corneal dystrophy. At first, only the corner of your dog's cornea might look white, but it can quickly spread so that the whole cornea looks thick and white. The cornea may also look swollen with fluid.Boston terriers inherit this condition where fluid builds up between the layers of cells in the corneal. Eventually, painful ulcers on the eye develop., Since corneal dystrophy will begin to affect your dog's vision, take him to the vet as soon as you suspect he has the eye problem. The vet will do a thorough examination and will look at your dog's eyes under a slit-lamp (a microscope with a bright light). The vet will look for thickening of the cornea, ulcers, and inflammation in the eye.The vet will also check your dog's eye pressure to rule out other eye conditions.  Unfortunately, there is no effective treatment for the milkiness of corneal dystrophy. Your vet will try to treat the secondary corneal ulcers caused by the corneal dystrophy since these are painful and can damage eye health.Your dog will probably need antibiotic eye cream to treat the ulcers.  The vet may suggest placing a contact lens over your dog's eye or doing surgery to graft tissue over the eye. Another surgery is available that lifts the flap of the eyeball and back of the eyeball to treat corneal dystrophy.Surgery can prevent ulcers, but it may cause scarring that can damage your dog's vision.  If your dog doesn't have ulcers and you notice he's in pain, see the vet immediately. Ulcers may be forming.  ","look for signs of corneal dystrophy. get a medical diagnosis. treat secondary ulcers. consider surgery. "
"Dozens of Native American tribes and other cultures have their own smudging ceremonies, and each one has its own traditions concerning which plants to use. Sage is probably the most common choice, and is especially important for the Cheyenne and other Great Plains cultures. While many cultures consider white sage to be excellent at driving away bad spirits or energies, other varieties are commonly used as well.;  , Cedar is another plant often burned in cleansing ceremonies, especially in the Pacific Northwest or Canada. Note that some trees referred to as 'cedars' are actually juniper trees, which some tribes use in smudging and some do not.While many people now mix multiple herbs together, the practice is not supported by some Native American elders.Again, there are many different smudging ceremonies, and some of them may call for sweetgrass or a different plant instead of sage or cedar. Follow this advice to perform an effective and respectful ceremony if you have not been taught a specific culture's tradition.  Sweetgrass, or holy grass, is a sacred plant across North America, and is often considered to represent kindness and please spirits.It is sometimes burned after the sage or cedar have cleared away negative energy.  If you have been taught a specific tribe's tradition that uses sweetgrass in the main ceremony, feel free to use it, or any other plant that tribe allows.  While tobacco can be added to the smudging ceremony, stick to one herb if this is your first time smudging. Instead, use tobacco as an offering before you harvest a different herb.See below for more information.  If you can, harvest these plants yourself as described in the sub-steps, preferably in as natural an environment as possible. Otherwise, obtain them from a Native American shop in person or online, to ensure the plants were treated appropriately.  Before picking the plant, many tribes thank the Creator or nature, then place or burn natural, raw tobacco as an offering.  Harvest the correct part of the cedar tree. Pick branches at eye level with green tips. Dry them and crush them into a rough powder before burning.You should not harvest sweetgrass yourself, as it is endangered in some areas.Sweetgrass is usually dried and braided before use, so try to find sustainably harvested sweetgrass braids from a Native American shop or online store., Clay or stone bowls are commonly used in smudging rituals. Abalone shells are another common container, but be aware that some Pacific Northwest tribes believe they are not appropriate for this ritual.  Bundles of herbs, called 'smudge sticks', can be made yourself or purchased pre-bundled. Some Native American elders question how traditional smudge sticks are, but they are now used even by many Native Americans., Many people use a feather or fan of feathers to waft the smoke during a smudging ceremony. In the US, eagle and hawk feathers are illegal to possess unless you belong to certain native tribes.Turkey feathers are legal, and traditionally used by some tribes in eastern North America. Do not use owl feathers, as these have different ritual purposes.It is illegal to buy wild feathers in the United States.Purchase cruelty-free feathers from farm-raised birds, or use feathers you've obtained yourself from hunting or finding them in the wild.  Keep your plants and smudging container on a space cleared for them, above the ground. A high bookshelf cleared for their use is a good choice. Do not use the herbs until they are dry, or you will fail to produce the right kind of smoke.  Many people smudge when they move into a new place or stay in a hotel room, to purify the new space. You may wish to perform a smudging ceremony after you hear bad news, or when you are preparing for a big change in your life.Smudging could also help you deal with the aftereffects of a big argument or a long illness.  Smudging is performed more frequently under certain circumstances, such as in places where other ceremonies take place, or sometimes during archaeological excavations of native remains and sacred materials.  Smudging a dorm room may be against university policy against fire use, although some U.S. institutions have changed these policies after challenges based on the First Amendment and freedom of religion.  ","use sage if you are not following a specific tradition. consider cedar instead if it grows in your area. only burn sweetgrass after the smudging ceremony is done. buy raw, natural tobacco if you want to harvest the plants yourself. obtain these plants from respectful sources. choose a natural container to hold it in, or bundle the herb into a bunch. waft the smoke with a turkey feather (optional). store the materials above waist height and let them dry. know when to smudge.

"You want your lipstick to match your clothing to some degree. The match does not have to be perfect, but something about your clothing items should match your lipstick.The simplest way to do this is to match your lipstick with your main outfit. For example, if you're wearing a red dress, opt for red metallic lips.  However, you can also choose to highlight a complimentary color in your outfit. For example, if you're wearing a black dress with pink stripes, pair this with pink lipstick. If you have an accessory of a particular color, like an orange necklace, go for orange lipstick.  Bolder metallic lips may pair better with a more feminine dress. Bold, dark red lips, for example, can be paired well with a classic black dress. If you opted for very bold metallic lips, choose a very feminine dress to match., Pinker shades often match well with floral patterns. Rose gold metallic lips, for example, may go great with a floral-patterned blouse or top.Be aware of colors as well. Try to, for example, match the pink roses in your dress with the color of your lipstick.  ","think about color when choosing clothes. pair bold colors with a feminine dress. consider floral patterns for pinker shades. "

"When you positively identify a mushroom, put it in your edible mushrooms basket. If you pick a mushroom but don’t know what it is or feel unsure about its identity, put it in the other basket., Because people often confuse mushrooms at the button stage, you should stick to picking mushrooms that have opened caps., You want to pick the edible mushrooms when they look fresh and fleshy. Cut them two inches above the ground. Put them in a basket. When you get home, put them in a closed paper bag in the refrigerator.  If they look old or decaying, leave them in the ground.  They should store for a week at home.  Be sure to dig your mushroom out in a way that leaves the base of the stalk undamaged! Do not pull it up. Replace the soil when you are done. Some mushrooms have important features, such as an easily destroyed sac, at the base of the stipe.  If you have any doubts at all about a mushroom that you have picked in the wild, toss it! Give yourself some time to learn the nuances of mushroom picking. After all, it’s not worth risking your life for a delicious meal. You are better off being cautious when it comes to eating mushrooms that you have foraged in the wild.“When in doubt, throw it out!”  If the mushroom looks good but there is something that bothers you about where you picked it, it’s not worth taking the chance!  , You may hear a number of misleading rules of thumb from people who like to hunt for wild mushrooms. However, there are no easy shortcuts to proper mushroom identification. As such, ignore the following rules of thumb:  “If an animal has nibbled the mushroom, it is fine.” This is not true.  “You can get rid of poisons by cooking the mushrooms.” This is also false. Although cooking will get rid of harmful bacteria and make edible mushrooms much more digestible, you can’t make a poisonous mushroom edible by cooking it!  “Mushrooms that smell good must be edible.” This is simply not true.  Mushrooms should be carried in paper bags or waxed paper, preferably in a rigid container. Smaller mushrooms can be kept intact by carrying them in a small, hard box. Some tackle boxes used for holding fishing flies are ideal for this purpose!  Plastic sandwich bags will turn them to unidentifiable mush.  Kneel down next to the mushroom you wish to identify. Put your nose right next to the gills of the mushroom and inhale deeply. Think of a few adjectives to describe the smell, such as sweet or smokey, and use these adjectives to start the identification process.How does your mushroom smell?  Does the mushroom smell generically fungal or phenolic?  Don’t taste the mushroom until you have finished the complete identification process.  Look at the gills on the underside of the mushroom to see whether they are clearly delineated or mushy looking. You’ll also want to look at how they connect to the stalk. The texture is also important to consider, as well as whether any liquid oozes from the gills. By asking yourself questions about the gills, you can begin the identification process:Are the gills covered by a veil of thin, felt-like, or cobwebby tissue?  See if the gills are connected to the stalk. If so, do they run down the stalk, meet it at a right angle, or barely touch it? This character, like color, can change in age!  Does your mushroom have plate-like gills under the cap surface, wrinkles, spongy tubes, or something else?  Do you see liquid oozing from the gills?  , You’ll need to take mental notes about the size, color and shape of the stalk. You’ll want to look at any characteristics of the skin covering the stalk, as well as the connection between the stalk and the gills.  Look at the size, color and shape of the stalk.  Is a stalk (stipe) present or absent?  , You’ll want to take detailed notes about the size of the cap. Then, describe any variation in the color of the cap, as well as whether there are any spots on it. Finally, the texture of the cap is important to consider, such as whether it is smooth or slimey.Ask key questions about the cap:  What is the diameter of the mushroom cap?  Are there colorful spots on the cap?  Look at the color of the cap.  What color is the flesh inside the cap?  Does your mushroom bruise when cut or crushed? What color?  , Take out your notebook. Look at your surroundings. Take detailed notes about your find in relation to the features of the landscape, such as trees, soil type, forest, other fungi, leaves, animals. These notes will help you make an accurate identification.A GPS locator is an excellent tool here!  Is the mushroom growing on dead wood, living tree, soil, moss, or something else entirely?  While fungi can form associations with many plants, trees are the most relevant to identification. If you can't tell the species of tree exactly, at least note whether conifers, hardwoods, or both are present. Which trees are present in the area?  Make a note if your mushroom is growing in a lawn, on sand, on moss, on another mushroom, or any other site of interest.  Try to get a few angles and include some of the surrounding landscape in some of the shots. When you are identifying the mushroom and consulting experts, you can compare your shots to the field guide. You can also show them to experts in order to confirm your identification.  Because the color of a mushroom’s spores is useful for identification, you could make a spore print at home. Cut off the stem of the mushroom and place the cap down on a piece of paper. Place a cup over the mushroom. Wait overnight and then remove the cup and the mushroom to see the spore print. If the mushroom is dropping spores, you will see them dusting the paper, allowing you to determine their color.If you anticipate a dark spore print, you should use white paper.  If you anticipate a white or light spore print, you should use dark paper.  If you have a sheet of glass, you can use it for the spore print.  The terms for spore color can be very precise. Chocolate brown, tobacco brown, and rusty brown are entirely different colors!  , When you get back to the picnic table or kitchen, look at the mushroom again. Use one book to identify it. Then, identify the mushroom using a second source, such as another book or article on the species., Although you may be eager to apply your mycological knowledge in the field, you should avoid jumping to any conclusions during the identification process. If you think it is an edible mushroom, examine all of its characteristics to make sure it is not a toxic look-alike.For example, Volvariella speciosa, a popular edible species in Asia, can be easily confused with Amanita phalloides, a deadly poisonous species in North America and Europe., If you see a mushroom that looks like the puffball mushrooms you are familiar with from the supermarket or television, you should skip it. Beginners are especially forewarned to avoid picking puffballs, since they can easily be confused with poisonous amanitas.The mushrooms that look most familiar to a beginner mycologist, such as puffballs, could easily be confused with a poisonous young amanita mushroom.You should also avoid the little brown mushroom, which is poisonous. It also looks a bit like the mushrooms you see in a supermarket.  Whereas a morel is perfectly hollow inside, a false morel looks like a brain on the inside. Don’t let commonalities like the dimpled appearance and the fact that they fruit at the same time confuse you. If you pick a morel, look on the inside. If it is brain-like on the inside as well as the outside, it is a false morel. , The best way to differentiate a chanterelle mushroom, which is edible, from a jack-o’-lantern, which is poisonous, is to look at the gills. A chanterelle mushroom has fake gills that run down the stem and are not easily removed from the cap. They look like they have been melted. In contrast, a jack-o’-lantern has true gills that look like little blades that don’t run down the stem.A jack-o’-lantern or false chanterelle is deep orange. In contrast, a chanterelle mushroom can be anything from light yellow or orange yellow.  Whereas jack-o’-interns grow in bunches that are attached at the stem, chanterelles like to grow alone or in small bunches and with separate stems.  One of the best ways to learn about picking wild mushrooms is to join a local mycological society. After joining, you will get invitations to forays at local parks where you can learn from experienced mushroom pickers. You may also get invited to special mushroom dinners and lectures on the science of mycology.  You will typically pay a small membership fee.  For instance, the Wisconsin mycology society has forays, lectures, dinners and workshops on mushrooms.The Mycological Society of Toronto runs forays in the spring and fall picking seasons, hosts dinners and runs lectures. It also has a quarterly newsletter called “Mycelium.” , Once you are a member of a mycological society, you will have access to mushroom identification courses.One of the best things you can do is take a day-long course that reviews the fundamentals of where to look for particular species, when to harvest different species and how to avoid poisonous look-alikes., The best way to learn how to pick mushrooms is by picking with an experienced mycologist. Go on a hike with someone who is both knowledgable and passionate about mushrooms. Pick their brain about how to safely forage for wild mushrooms.If you are part of a mycological society, you should be able to meet some fellow mushroom loving friends at one of the forays.  You should pick up at least one general book on mycology and one field guide that focuses on your particular region. Whereas the general mycology book will review the fundamentals of mushroom picking, your field guide will offer tips that are specific to the place where you want to pick them.For instance, a good introduction is How to Identify Edible Mushrooms by Tony Lion and Gill Tomblin.  Mushrooms by Roger Phillips is a good place to start.  You might be interested in Mushrooms: River Cottage Handbook No 1.  You can’t teach yourself to be a mycologist by just looking at a few images of edible mushrooms online. Rather than searching with the “images” function on your search engine, you should consult reputable books on mycology and ask experts for help with identification., To avoid picking the wrong mushroom, you should familiarize yourself with both poisonous and difficult to identify species. If you are a beginner, for instance, you should avoid picking lactarius and russula species. Read the notes in your field guide about the dangerous mushrooms in your region.Avoid poisonous species like amanita, galerina, entoloma and cortinarius.  ","forage with two baskets. avoid picking mushrooms in the button stage. pick the fleshy mushrooms. follow the golden rule. ignore misleading rules of thumb. store and transport the mushrooms safely. smell the mushroom. look at the shape and texture of the gills. examine the size and color of the stalk. take notes about the size and color of the cap. take detailed notes about the location. take a photograph of the mushroom before picking it. obtain a mushroom spore print. use multiple sources to make an identification. don’t skip any steps in the identification process. avoid picking puffballs. see the difference between a morel and a toxic false morel. don’t confuse the jack-o’-lantern with the chanterelle. join a mycological society. take a mushroom identification course. go on forays with experienced mycologists. purchase a field guide to mycology. avoid misleading information and images online. learn about dangerous mushrooms.

"Many people have jobs where they work at a desk. This is one of the main places where slouching can be at its worst. As you work throughout the day, you lean toward your computer or over your desk as you work on documents. If you sit too far forward, you put pressure on your pubic bone. If you sit too far back, you put pressure on your tailbone. In order to stop this trend, you should lean back in your chair, keeping your back flush with the chair's support.  If you feel too far away from your desk or computer, pull your chair closer or move your monitor closer to you on the desk.Adjust your computer screen such that the middle of the screen is at eye level. This can help you keep proper posture and prevent back pain.If you find yourself still slouching, try setting an alarm on your phone to remind you every hour to sit up straighter. This will help you get into the habit and you'll eventually not need the reminder., In all aspects of your life, you should sit properly to avoid muscle and back problems. You need to find a comfortable middle range where everything is aligned naturally. Sit with your feet flat on the floor and center your weight between your buttocks and pubic bone.  This goes for every place you sit. For example, make sure you are comfortable and sit straight in the car, especially if you have a long commute. Use a pillow or adjust your seat to get your back and spine aligned and centered while you drive., To assess how your posture normally is, you need to evaluate how you stand. Turn facing a mirror and stand like you normally do. If your palms face your thighs with your thumbs pointing ahead of you, you have good posture. If your hands rest ahead of your thighs or behind your thighs, or if your palms back backwards, then your posture is wrong.  If you find that your posture is off, pull back your head and pull your shoulders down and back. This will realign your spine and get your posture toward the right angle.  If you feel like your chest is popping out, you are standing correctly., Your muscles become fatigued when you still for long periods of time. Strive to get up and stretch for at least 1-2 minutes for every half hour of sitting. Stand and stretch, placing your hands against your lower back with fingers facing down. Lean back as far as you can and hold for a few seconds. Repeat a few times to get the kinks out of your back.  If you are at home, you can also lie flat on the floor with your weight on your elbows. Push your chest up, stretching out your lower back and spine.  Only do these exercises to the extent that your muscles are comfortable. Do not overextend your muscles because you don't want to cause injury., When you sleep, you can have poor posture that reflects in your normal, waking posture. If you sleep on your side, try putting a pillow between your knees to help lessen the pull on your lower back. If you sleep on your back, you can put a pillow underneath your knees to help release the tension placed on your lower back while you sleep.  Whether you sleep on you back or your side, placing a rolled up towel under your neck will allow your head and shoulders proper alignment.You should not sleep on your stomach. This position places too much strain on your neck as you sleep., There are times when you might have to carry a large load, such as a large purse, a backpack, or luggage. When you have to deal with these kinds of loads, you should try to balance the weight around as much as possible to keep strain off of your muscles and joints. If the weight is balanced, you will also be able to keep your normal, straight posture while you walk.  To help balance your loads, you should use bags that distribute the weight evenly, such as backpacks or rolling luggage., When you are at work, at home, or in the car, you can sit for too long and start to feel pain in your lower back. To help prevent this, you can make yourself a pad to place along your lower back to help keep your posture straighter. Take a towel and fold it in half and then in half again. From the long rectangle, roll it into a cylinder, making a cushy pillow to put in your chair.  If a bath towel is too big, you can try a hand towel instead. Just fold it in half once and roll it into a small pillow for your back., Relaxation techniques, such as meditation, massage therapy and yoga, can restore tired muscles. They also calm the central nervous system and combat the fatigue that invites slouching. Whether you join a new yoga class around the corner from your office or simply sit up and take a few deep, cleansing breaths, make time in your day for some relaxation to decrease muscle tension.  ","have better posture at work. sit in a better position. check yourself in the mirror. stretch when you get up. check your sleep posture. balance the weight you carry. make a lower back pad. try relaxation techniques.

"Laundry that’s piled up on the floor can start to take on a musty odor, and this can make the entire room smell.What's worse, wet laundry can be a breeding ground for mold. Collect laundry from all over the house, separate it into loads, and wash it in the washing machine.  To ensure you kill mold and other bacteria on clothes, use a hot water cycle to wash the clothes.  To dry your laundry, you can either tumble dry it, or hang it to dry if the weather is nice.  Always check care labels before laundering or tumble drying any garments.;  , You spend about a third of your life in your bed, so it’s no wonder that sheets, blankets, and pillow cases can start to smell up a room after a while. To remove these odors, strip the pillow cases, sheets, and other washable linens and covers from the bed, and wash them in the washing machine.  When the bedding is clean, dry it in the dryer or on a line before making the bed again.  Kitchen and bathroom sinks and drains can be home to mold, mildew, clogs, and other things that can cause bad smells in your house. To clean the drain, pour 1 cup (220 g) of baking soda down the drain. Pour 2 cups (470 ml) of white vinegar down the drain after the baking soda. Let the mixture foam and bubble for about 30 minutes.When the baking soda and vinegar mixture has had time to bubble its way through the drain, rinse the drain with a kettle-full of boiling hot water.  Toilets are another household fixture that can house mold, mildew, bacteria, and other stink-sources. Pour 1 cup (235 ml) of vinegar into the bowl. Spray down the outside of the bowl and seat with vinegar as well. Let the vinegar stand for five minutes. Scrub the inside of the bowl with the toilet brush, and wipe the outside of the bowl and the seat with rags or paper towels.Flush the toilet to get rid of any particles that may have been scrubbed loose from the bowl.  Mold has a particular smell that can permeate your entire home. It’s important for your health and the smell of your home to deal with any mold problems, such as in the shower, on tiles, in sinks, or in other damp areas of the house. To kill mold:Combine 1 cup (235 ml) of bleach and 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water in a bucket  Put on protective rubber gloves  Open the windows to increase air flow  Dip a stiff-bristled brush into the cleaning solution  Scrub affected areas with the brush  Dip the brush back into the solution regularly as you scrub  Rinse the area with a damp sponge  , Dirty carpets and furniture can harbor bad smells that make your living areas stink. To remove dust and smelly particles, vacuum all the carpets in the house with a wide brush attachment. To remove dusty and musty smells from furniture, vacuum all upholstered furniture using an upholstery attachment.  For the best results, use a vacuum that’s outfitted with a HEPA filter, as this will prevent dust and other fine particles from floating back into the air., The garbage is one of the worst offenders that cause stinky rooms, especially kitchen garbage that house food and other wet waste. When your kitchen smells, start by tying up the garbage and taking it outside or to the garage., Before putting a fresh bag into the empty garbage can, give the can itself a good cleaning to remove any spills or particles that could cause lingering smells. To clean the garbage can:Put on rubber gloves  Remove large pieces of food  Rinse the can in the bathtub or outside with a garden hose  Wipe the inside dry with rags or paper towels  Spray the inside with a generous amount of all-purpose cleaner and disinfectant  Let the cleaner sit for five minutes  Scrub the can with a stiff-bristled brush  Rinse the can  Dry the can with rags or paper towels  Put in a new garbage bag  , Any appliance that comes in contact with food can be a source of smells in your house, especially if there have been recent spills. If you're not sure where the smell is coming from, clean all your food-related appliances, including:Garbage disposal  Refrigerator  Oven  Microwave  , As much as you love your dog, it’s possible that your pup is bringing some bad smells into the house. To eliminate this odor source, give your dog a bath in a tub or sink with pet shampoo, take a trip to the groomers, or visit a pet bath station at the local pet store.  Throw your dog’s bed into the washing machine and clean it as well to get rid of any lingering odors., Fresh air is one of the greatest ways to get rid of bad smells in the house, because the smells can be carried out of the open windows and replaced with clean air. In spring, summer, and fall, open a few windows throughout the house. To create a breeze, open windows that are on opposite sides of the house.  In winter when it’s not possible to keep the windows open, open a window for just a minute to let in some fresh air., Fans are great for boosting the refreshing power of clean air. When you have the windows open, turn on ceiling and standing fans in the house to help create a bigger breeze and get the air moving.  Sunlight contains ultra-violet rays, which have the power to kill things like smell-causing mold and bacteria. No matter what time of year it is, open the curtains and drapes throughout the house on a sunny day and let the UV rays in.  Sunlight can be an effective odor killer for carpets, furniture, pet areas, pillows and cushions, and other household items that can smell., Baking soda is one of the most popular deodorizers around, because it’s effective and cheap. To absorb smells around the house, sprinkle some baking soda into a couple of small dishes or plates and distribute them around the house. The baking soda will absorb odors from the rooms and get rid of bad smells.To further deodorize household items, sprinkle baking soda over things like carpets, furniture, mattresses, and other possible odor sources. Leave the baking soda for 30 minutes, and then vacuum it up.  Vinegar is also an effective deodorizer that you can use to absorb bad smells around the house. Fill a few small bowls with vinegar and place the bowls in smelly areas around the house, such as:Musty basements  Bathrooms  Kitchens  Bedrooms  , Charcoal is similarly a powerful odor absorber that can be used in many rooms and inside appliances to deodorize.Be sure to use pure charcoal and not something that contains lighter fluid. Place a few pieces of charcoal on plates and distribute them around the house. You can put them in:  Closets  Refrigerator and freezer  Living areas  , Certain houseplants are known to clean the air, and they may help to control odors in the house as well. Houseplants you can grow around the house for air-purification include:Snake plants  English ivy  Lady palms  Dracaena  , Fabric softener sheets make your clothes smell great, and they can do the same for the air in your house.To use these as an air freshener, place sheets in smelly areas around the house, such as in:  Shoe closets  Garbage cans  Wet basements  Areas where mold has been  , When you boil water in the kitchen, the water particles evaporate and get carried around the house. You can turn this into a potent air freshener by adding your favorite herbs, spices, and citrus rinds to a pot, filling it with water, and boiling it on the stove with the lid off for a couple of hours. Ingredients you can use in the simmer pot include:Lemon peels  Cinnamon sticks  Allspice  Basil  Ginger  Cranberries  Orange peels  Cloves  Bay leaf  , Commercial air fresheners are specifically designed to make the air in your house smell clean and wonderful. These devices often contain chemicals that mask bad odors, plus fragrances that make the air smell nice. Air fresheners come in a variety of forms, including:Sprays  Diffusers  Gels  Waxes  , Incense comes in many forms and in many different smells. To burn incense sticks, place the skinny end of the stick into an incense holder. Light the opposite end of the stick until the tip begins to glow, and then blow out the flame. As the incense burns it will release sweet-smelling smoke that will make the air smell great.  To distribute the smell throughout the entire house, set up a fan on the opposite side of the room to the incense. This will produce air to blow the smoke throughout the house, but not too much breeze that ashes blow everywhere.  Never leave incense unattended, as it does produce heat and can cause fires.

"It is not a good idea to start your painting project on a surface that hasn't been thoroughly cleaned, and kitchen countertops can have years of builder on them, especially the surfaces nearest the stove.  Use an ammonia-based cleaning solution to scrub the laminate and/or ceramic tile countertops free of all dirt, grime, oil and grease. Allow the surface to dry completely.;  , Using painter's tape, cover any trim, walls or cabinets that might get dripped on or accidentally painted, and protect your floors with a drop cloth. Expending the effort on this preparation will save you a lot of time and aggravation on touch-ups and cleanups after you refinish the countertops.  Prepare the countertops with a good quality bonding primer that will improve paint adhesion, allowing the primer to dry for at least 24 hours before beginning to paint.  Ask the professionals at your home improvement store for suggestions on the best brands.  Using the color you selected, you can start to paint the countertops now that the bonding primer is completely dry. Avoid applying the paint too thickly and paint 2 or 3 thin coats instead, allowing each coat to dry between applications.  For laminate countertops, use a water-based paint. For tile countertops, use an oil-based paint.  In order to protect your painting project from chipping or scratching, use a water-based, non-yellowing polyurethane finish. Apply 3 coats of polyurethane, each coat drying before you apply the next. After the third coat has dried, wait an additional 24 hours before using your newly painted countertops.  ","begin with clean countertops. cover any areas you don't want painted. apply a bonding primer. paint the countertops. seal the paint. "
"You can do this by looking through people's bases who attacked you earlier on in your battle log, do the 'Quick Match' method, or finding a player's base on the GRA map. The base should be at a level so that your commanded attacks (A10s, Hellfire Missiles and Orbital Strike) are able to destroy them.;  , Your strike force increases the damage and health of about 60% and this is very good for every base. Preferably activate it to your rangers, as they will burn defenses down more quickly and can speed up the process. Use the Strike Force before it runs out - you won't be able to use it on a tarmac for 1 hour after the first use of it is finished.  Don't just dive into a base that looks like a walk in the park and hope for the best. Take the time to work out the areas of possible dangers and possible safety. Tap/Click on a defense or structure of the base, as this will give you information of it's health and level. If the base looks undefeatable, such as, your up-to-date Level 14 HQ base getting put up against a very strong Level 20 HQ base, then it is probably not worth losing some of your medals over. If the base looks easy enough to defeat and you may not lose a sufficient amount of troops, then feel free to turn it to rubble.  Go in and destroy or weaken as many defenses as you can with the radius of the airstrike. Don't just use it to kill commandos at a rally flag, or oil derricks and supply stockpiles holding loads of loot. Use it carefully, especially for when it is more than capable of destroying something.  You can use the Orbital Strike to take down what may not have got fully destroyed in the A10 airstrike and focus it on a rally flag of commandos that are at an inconvenient location.  This has a smaller radius than the A10 and should only be used to destroy a single target rather than multiple. Also use it carefully and see if it can weaken or destroy other structures around it.  When the base is destroyed at a level that you can attack it, leave behind enough command points that will get you enough for a Medpack. These are vital to prevent any sudden ambushes or damage to your troops as soon as they are deployed.  A combination of rangers and Tomahawks are a good combination that is one of the best out there. Deploy your rangers first, and then deploy your Tomahawks at a safe distance so they are not ambushed, as Tomahawks are very weak.  As you keep destroying the base, keep feeding command points to your troops as well as managing them carefully or saving up for another approach with an A10 or Hellfire or Orbital Strike.  Use whatever command points you have to use on defenses or your troops to speed along the process. Be careful though, you will lose medals if you don't achieve any stars!  , Once you place a commanded attack or as soon as you deploy your troops, you have 3 minutes to destroy it completely. Don't be in any rush to get it done. Use the time wisely and the music to the attacking process can even keep you in time!  , If the base is giving away loot, the loot may be increased by 10% or 20% depending on how many stars you achieve. You will also receive medals depending on how much you were able to destroy. Rush back though to call back all your troops before the time of your strike force runs out on your tarmac!  ","find a suitable base to destroy. activate your strike force to your tarmacs. scout and observe the base. use your a10 airstrike to start. use the orbital strike to destroy damaged defenses or just a regular defense. use a hellfire missile to destroy and/or weaken the strongest of defenses. leave behind at least 5 command points. deploy your troops. manage your command points as you go. retreat only if you have to. be aware of the time limit. celebrate your victory!

"If you rarely speak to your best friend's sister, it's not a good idea to walk up to her and start a huge conversation as if you've known her for years. Instead, when you're with your best friend and their sister walks by, just politely say hello to her.;  , Usually while you're over at a friend's house, their siblings will come interrupt you for one reason or another. Use this to your advantage. When your best friend's sister comes over to talk, don't just sit there silently. Talk to her as if she's a new friend. At first, keep the conversations short and sweet, and build on them as you go.  If you see your friend's sister at school or out in public, acknowledge her and talk to her. Say hello and wave to her, and see if she wants to stop and talk to you. If she waves and keeps walking, don't follow her. However, if she stops or starts walking over to you, start a conversation with her.  If you have accounts on websites such as Facebook, Myspace, Twitter, Formspring, etc., add her as a friend so that you can keep in touch. As long as you've talked to her enough so that she knows you, she should have no issues to adding you as a friend.  Sometimes a best friend's sister can be so close to you that you feel like she's your sister too. If you have a problem and she is the type of person who'd be up to helping you, give her a call one day. Call her and have a nice conversation. If calling her is too weird, try texting her instead.  If you start to feel more romantically attracted to her and want to get out of the friend zone, consider asking her out.  ","say 'hello'. talk to her. talk to her outside of your friend's house. add her to your social networking accounts. call her once in a while. decide if you want to be friends or something more. "
"The types of things that are helpful to bear in mind when choosing a suitable journal include:  Length: Are you planning on recording your dreams for a year journal, or a shorter or longer amount of time? Think about how detailed you want your entries to be each night; this plus the length of time you aim to record your dreams for will indicate the length of journal that you need.  Ability to move the pages around: If you want to be able to sort pages into themes (for example, 'Recurrent Dreams', 'Dreams about dogs'), etc., then it might be helpful to use a looseleaf notebook that lets you reshuffle the pages easily. Use a quality binder to keep such a looseleaf journal intact.  Jottings: The ability to add in jottings that you've written down elsewhere can also be important. Make sure that the journal has space for adding in scraps of paper, etc.  Don't forget to get a suitable marker. If you want to write in different colors for specific themes or recurrent interpretations, keep this in mind when purchasing the markers.  Consider finding a tin, basket, or other storage item for your dream journal and markers. This allows you to keep all the things needed sitting neatly and ready for use at any time.  Consider using a travel cover or protective case for your journal if you travel a lot and want to take your dream journal with you wherever you go.;  , The problem with rummaging for something to write on is that you're likely to forget your dream in the meantime, so make sure you can easily reach your dream journal!  If you have it in a container like a tin or a basket, it can be easily moved about and into a drawer or cupboard space when cleaning or to keep away from prying eyes.  Another good idea is to keep a book reading light by your bedside. If you wake up in the middle of the night and feel compelled to write down a dream, an easily accessible light will enable you to do this before forgetting the dream.  If you prefer speaking into a recordable MP3 player, be sure to have it handy and to keep the dream journal files in good order, and to transfer them regularly to a back-up. It doesn't hurt to keep around some spare batteries, too, in case you forget to turn off your MP3 player during the night and you need to make a new entry in a hurry.  That way, you don't have to spend time worrying about the date when you first wake up and can just get down to writing the dream. Some dream journal writers like to write the next day's date in after the journal entry for that morning is completed, others prefer to write it in the night before as a 'readying ritual' of sorts.  If you do write in the date the night before, you might also like to note down how you're feeling. The feelings that you are experiencing may have an important influence on the dreams you experience during the night, so keeping a quick note of these can lead to insight later on. It can be especially helpful as a mood reminder for those jolting 'a-ha!' or 'pull-the-rug-from-under you' type dreams which can sometimes feel as if they appeared out of the blue.  There is no right or wrong way to prepare the dream journal or to record in it but you can help yourself by making the linkages between dream and interpretation a little easier to spot.  Column method: If you draw a column down the middle of each journal page, this allows you to write down the dream on one side of the page, and then to write the possible interpretations down on the other side of the page, directly opposite each part of the dream being interpreted.  Write then follow up: If you don't like cramming things into columns, simply follow a process of writing down the dream first, then following up with the interpretation under the dream write-up. After all, writing down the dream is the most time sensitive part and should be given plenty of space; interpreting the dream later on is less urgent.  Use your usual method for falling asleep and dreaming. You might find it helps to remind yourself that you expect to be writing up your dreams in the morning, so that you have a focus in your subconscious on the importance of remembering your dreams.  See wikiHow's many dream articles for ideas on having, controlling, and influencing your dreaming.  It's a good idea to use a beeping or ringing alarm rather than a radio or music alarm. The talking or singing might distract you from remembering the contents of your dream. If you're fine with waking up without an alarm, that's even better and a lot more peaceful.  Upon awakening, begin recording your dreams. If you can, hold off on visiting the bathroom until the dreams are recorded because any interruption between waking and recording can lose the dream, or its principal points and edginess. With more experience and practice, you may find this isn't such a problem and recall becomes easier but for the beginner, the fewer distractions the better.Record everything that you can remember. At first it can be difficult to work out what to write down and to distinguish thoughts that may be creeping into your awoken mind from memories about your dreams. With practice though, you'll soon be able to recall the things that the dream has told you. Include characters, symbols, colors, textures, feelings, actions (such as flying or swimming), interactions with other beings, shapes, and anything else that the dream raised.Think of some adjectives to describe the most vivid and pressing images and feelings that the dream brings about in you. For example, if you dreamed about a house on fire, you might write: 'terrifying, exciting, and red hot burning house', with your feelings being 'afraid, panicking, curious'.  Some dream journal writers like to draw images or use different colors to express different emotions or themes in a dream. (Colors themselves can be an important part of dream interpretation.), Don't try to form a narrative as you are jotting down the contents of your dream. Just focus on getting down all the information you can recall as quickly as possible before the details of your dream fade from memory. You can deal with forming a narrative, and interpreting your dream, later.  The dream journal isn't a marathon and few people have all morning to lie around writing in a journal. The best approach is to go with the dream or two that really seems most powerful or enduring for you. After the first dream or two, it's likely you'll be getting hazier in your recollection anyway, and it's best to write down the most vivid recollections above all because they're likely to be the ones with the most resonance and meaning for you.  It's a good habit to get into naming your dreams. In reducing each dream to a title, try to capture the main feeling or theme behind it. It's an easy way for you to find the dream again for future reference and it's also a neat way of summarizing your general reaction to the dream.  Initially, it might be difficult to remember enough of a dream to write more than a few lines. Persevere because with practice, it becomes easier to remember more and more elements of the dream until it becomes a habit. Therefore it's important to persist with writing in your dream journal every morning even if you think you had a bland or uneventful dream. Sometimes those dreams are telling in themselves and sometimes in writing them down, you realize that they weren't so pointless after all., If you don't wish to start interpreting at the beginning, that's fine. Just getting used to recording dreams is a new learning curve and getting the dreams down initially is the important part. You can always return later and record the interpretation, provided you've added some key feeling words with the dream. In time, it's a good idea to start interpreting the dream using dream interpretation knowledge you've learned from books, online sites, and your own intuition. Some things will be more obvious than others, but give it a good go.Sometimes the meaning of a dream might not become clear until you've realized it's recurring and that there is something happening in your life that you might need to pay closer attention to. Indeed, the more important messages tend to repeat as a way of getting through to you.  Read How to interpret your dreams for more information on how to interpret dreams.  Ultimately how you use and manage your dream journal is a personal thing and it's up to you to make of it what you will. If you find that any of the suggestions offered here aren't working for you but other ways do, by all means incorporate your ways into keeping the dream journal. Use whatever makes most sense and works best for you., Keep your dream journal with you when you travel or take a vacation. If you don't want to take your main journal for fear of losing it, compile a lightweight travel version that can be inserted into the other journal when you return home.

"With the exception a a few professional inline leagues, most inline hockey players do not wear shoulder pads because direct checking is not allowed, although, rubbing players into the boards is OK. There are players however, that feel more comfortable and protected wearing shoulder pads anyway. Another alternative to shoulder pads that many high level players wear, is a padded shirt. These are breathable stretch shirts with pieces of foam and hard plastic shells inserted. They offer good protection without having bulk of shoulder pads.(They are also socially accepted so you won't get chirped at. XD);  , One piece of equipment a lot of inline players do not wear but should is a girdle or 'hockey pants.' Inline girdles are more lightweight and cooler than ice girdles. There might not be legal checking, but this is still a contact sport and collisions are frequent. Most inline girdles have a jock built in and some even come with a cup.  , Shin guards are both recommended and required equipment. Ice hockey shin guards are more often than not exactly the same as inline, as in, shin guards are shin guards as long as they are designed for hockey. Hockey shin guards also provide knee protection unlike soccer shin guards for example, and are designed to take the impact of a puck as well as a stick.  Many players over the age of 18 prefer no extra face protection or wear a half shield. A full face cage or shield is highly recommended.  , Often times sticks from opposing players will get up on the hands, many times unintentionally. Gloves are the same as shin guards in the sense there is no difference between ice hockey and inline gloves.  , Inline Hockey skates for the most part, are ice hockey skates with wheels. If you are looking for skates, try them on first and see what feels comfortable to you. If you have the option, bake new skates. Baking skates helps them conform to the shape of your foot and much faster. This makes the breaking in process shorter and less painful. One mistake a lot of new or inexperienced skaters make is not tying their skates tight enough. Once you have the skates good a tight, pull them tighter. The tighter the skate the healthier for your ankles and knees but also, the better and faster you will be able to skate. Loose skates will be harder to stand on and when you take a stride will absorb the energy of your push whereas a tight skate will transfer that energy through the skate to the floor.  This is a matter a preference. Some people like to wear their shins over the tongue of their skates. Other players prefer to wear their shins under the tongue, or inside their skates.  Ice on the other hand calls for a bigger girdle so nothing is worn over it, instead hockey socks are worn to cover the shin guards. Some inline players also play ice and wear an ice girdle and hockey socks when playing inline. Other inline players wear shorts over their girdle and wear ice hockey socks. Wearing pants or socks is not important however, most leagues require you to cover all your pads.  The type of jersey you wear does not matter however, inline jerseys are much cooler than ice jerseys.  ","decide whether to wear shoulder pads. get a girdle. an athletic cup is very important for both male and female players and is required of players under the age of 18. , get shin guards. helmets are also a required piece of equipment for all ages and for players under the age of 18 it also required they wear a full face cage or shield. mouth pieces are only required of players under the age of 18 however, but are recommended. , hockey gloves are important if you like having the use of your fingers. hockey elbow pads are another piece of equipment that is not worn by many players and most definitely should be worn every time you are on the floor. , choose your skates carefully. put your shin guards wherever they feel comfortable. typically, inline hockey uniforms call for inline hockey pants which you wear over your girdle and shin guards. inline jerseys are also much lighter than ice jerseys.

"Look for ¼ inch (6mm) vinyl hose at a pet store, or the faucet and sprinkler section of a home improvement store. You only need enough to transfer water from the tank to the other container.  Tie a simple overhand knot in the tubing. Place one end in the aquarium and the other in an empty bucket, lower down. Suck on the dry end to get the siphon started, then watch the flow. Tighten or loosen the knot until only a drip comes out, aiming for about 1 drip per second.  You may use a clamp instead to clamp the tube nearly closed.  Stand the bag in a fish-safe container that holds ½ to 1 gallon (2–4 liters). Gently pour the water and fish from the bag into the container. If the water would be too shallow for the fish, just stand the open bag upright with the fish inside.  Siphon the tank water again, this time into the container with the fish. Let it fill up until you've transferred ½ gallon (2 liters) of aquarium water.  Do not pour any water back into the tank, as it may contain undesirable substances or organisms from the pet store.

"In order to solve any physics problem you must know which equation to use. Writing down all of the known information is the first step to finding the right equation. If you have values for the final velocity, acceleration, and time involved, you can use the following equation:  Initial velocity: Vi = Vf - (a * t)  Understand what each symbol stands for.  Vi stands for “initial velocity”  Vf stands for “final velocity”  a stands for “acceleration”  t stands for “time”  Note that this equation is the standard equation used when finding initial velocity.;  , Once you have written the known information and determined the proper equation, you can fill in values for the appropriate variables. Carefully setting up each problem and writing out every step of the process is important.  If you make a mistake, you can easily find it by looking back at all of your previous steps.  With all of the numbers in place, use the proper order of operations to finish the problem. If you’re allowed, use a calculator to limit the number of simple math mistakes.  For example: An object accelerating east at 10 meters (32.8 ft) per second squared traveled for 12 seconds reaching a final velocity of 200 meters (656.2 ft) per second. Find the initial velocity of that object.  Write the known information:  Vi = ?, Vf = 200 m/s, a = 10 m/s2, t = 12 s  Multiply the acceleration and time. a * t = 10 * 12 =120  Subtract the product from the final velocity. Vi = Vf – (a * t) = 200 – 120 = 80 Vi = 80 m/s east  Write your answer correctly. Include a unit of measurement, usually meters per second or m/s, as well as a direction the object was traveling in. Without providing information about the direction, you only have a measurement of speed rather than velocity.  ","know the right equation to use. fill in the known information. solve the equation. "
"Not many girls, at any age, want to date a dirty boy. It’s good to get into the practice of taking care of yourself at an early age.

"A great way to build a good neighborhood is to start with your home. Basic maintenance is a great way of creating the impression that your neighborhood is a good place to live. If you don’t maintain your home, you’ll send the impression that you don’t care about your neighborhood or your neighbors.  Paint your home (as needed).  Make necessary repairs to your home. This includes rotten wood, broken shutters, and more.  While some repairs might be expensive, basic maintenance (paint touchups and replacing wood rot) can be inexpensive if you do it yourself.;  , In many places, the idea of a good neighborhood is tied to positive and desirable aesthetics. One of the most important aspects of this is the way people’s lawns and yards look. If you want to make your neighborhood a better place, you should put some effort into tending to your lawn and yard.  Cut your grass regularly. This might mean cutting every week or two depending on the season and your region.  Remove fallen limbs, sticks, and other organic debris from your yard.  Sod or seed your yard, if you lack grass., If you are serious about building a better neighborhood, you should make sure that you aren’t accumulating junk in your yard. Storing junk in sight of your neighbors can alienate them and create a negative vibe in your neighborhood. This is because you’re likely to decrease property values and give the impression that your neighborhood is a less nice place than it really is.  Don’t store your collection of classic project cars in your front yard or where your neighbors can see them. If you are serious about your fifteen project cars, put up a privacy fence to protect them and hide them from sight.  Make sure trash makes it to the curb on trash pick-up day.  Avoid storing excess furniture, Christmas decorations, your lawn mower, or other collectables on your porch., One of the best ways to create a good neighborhood is to make sure that you don’t create any problems for your neighbors. After all, if you create problems for your neighbors, they’ll probably resent you and won’t want to interact with you. This will help establish a negative vibe in your neighborhood.  Don’t let your animals roam freely. Free ranging dogs may chase children on bikes, runners, or otherwise cause problems. Free roaming cats could kill birds, squirrels, and more.  Avoid blocking the path to your neighbor’s driveway. This could include not putting trash on the curb next to your neighbor’s driveway, or parking your car (or visitors’ cars) in certain spots., Noise complaints and noise problems are one of the biggest issues in many neighborhoods. As a result, if you want to better your neighborhood, limit the noise you produce.  Monitor your dog (or other pets) and make sure they don’t bark or otherwise disturb your neighbors on a continual basis.  If you have parties, make sure to limit the noise you produce and turn all music off at a reasonable hour. In many cases, eleven or midnight on the weekend is a good time to turn your music off. Nine or ten at night is a good time to turn it off on a week day.  Try not to blast the radio too loud as you’re washing your car.  Avoid sawing wood or cutting down a tree at inopportune times. Home improvement projects are best done between the hours of 10 and 5 on weekends.

"Tattoos are a popular way for people who no longer self harm to cover the scars permanently without completely eliminating it. You will still be able to feel the ridges of your scars under the tattoo, so it can serve as a reminder of what you've been through and where you are now.  A tattoo might be a good choice if you like the look of tattoos, are old enough (18 and up in most places), and you are in a profession where a tattoo will not negatively affect your career.  You should wait at least two years after self harming episodes have ended before getting a tattoo. This is because the scars are still healing and fresh scars do not always reliably take ink.A tattoo can be relatively simple if the scars cover a small surface area, but larger affected surfaces (like an entire thigh) will require a large, intricate tattoo, which can be more expensive and painful.  Be aware that some very substantial, large scars (from deep wounds) might not take the ink. Talk to an experienced tattoo artist about whether your scars are likely to take the ink., A tattoo is permanent, so it's important to choose something that you want to look at for the rest of your life. Depending on the amount of surface area covered by your scars, you may need a large, intricate design.  Many people who tattoo their self-harm scars choose a custom design that represents survival, overcoming, newfound confidence, or another positive perspective on life. This can be a great way to turn something that was once negative into something positive, and reclaim your body.Try searching online for search terms like 'tattoos to cover self harm scars.' Some ideas include a phoenix, a mythological bird who dies and is reborn from its own ashes; a verse of poetry or other inspiring words like 'hope,' or 'just when the caterpillar thought the world was over, she became a butterfly'; a bird escaping from a cage; or any intricate, beautiful design that you love.  Most people find their tattoo artist by asking someone who has had work done that they admire. If you don't know anyone, feel free to start a conversation with a stranger and compliment them on their art. Most people with tattoos like to know that others find it as gorgeous as they do.Check out potential artists' studios in person, and make sure everything is clean up to date on inspections and relevant certifications (depending on where you live, this will vary). Ask to see a portfolio of pieces the artist has done recently. Find out if the artist has any experience covering scars. If not, ask if they know someone who does; tattoo artists tend to have large networks and want you to get the best work for your needs.

"Dwarf hamsters can get severe diarrhea, but they do not get wet tail. Long-haired teddy hamsters, on the other hand, seem to be the most prone to wet tail.Ask your breeder or veterinarian about your breed’s risk of wet tail when purchasing hamsters, so you know your pet’s risks.  Very young hamsters between 3 - 8 weeks of age seem especially vulnerable to an infection. This is likely because their immune systems are still developing, and aren't very good at fighting off bugs yet. Research suggests that most the bacteria most likely to case wet tail is the Desulfovibrio species., The most easily affected hamsters seem to be weaned baby hamsters up to the age of 8 weeks.Always give new hamsters time to adjust to their new surroundings before handling them too much. Otherwise, you might stress them out too much and contribute to wet tail conditions.  Give new hamsters about a week to settle in before handling them often.  It is also a good idea to isolate them during this time, as wet tail can be incubating for 7 days before the symptoms appear., This lets a bacterium called clostridium overwhelm the gut, causing diarrhea and wet tail symptoms. Factors which can trigger the initial gastrointestinal disturbance include:  Stress (for example, from an overcrowded cage or from fear of a predator like a house cat)  Change of diet  Certain antibiotics given by mouth for other illnesses  , Conditions like irritable bowel syndrome or bowel cancer can be contributing factors to wet tail.

"There are factors that predispose you to AF. Knowing these predisposing factors can help you to manage your AF. While some of these risk factors cannot be controlled, knowing what they are can help you to prepare for them, and will help when coming up with a management plan with your doctor.They include:  Increasing age. Stroke and heart attack affect people of all ages, but the risk increases as you get older.Gender. Men more commonly develop medical conditions caused by AF.  Heredity. People whose close blood relations have had a stroke have a higher risk of stroke, heart diseases, and AF.  History of heart problems. If you have previously had a stroke or heart attack, your chances of having AF or other heart issues increases., Irregular heart rhythms due to AF can cause pooling of blood in the heart, which can lead to the formation of clots. These clots are at risk of being dislodged and traveling to the brain, where they can block blood flow and cause a stroke.  You may also suffer from heart failure due to AF, because it causes the heart to beat irregularly. Over time, the heart muscle can become weak and this can result in poor circulation of blood throughout the body and eventual heart failure., When you have AF, your doctor may choose to routinely monitor your condition through a variety of tests that will provide a clearer picture or you condition. These tests may include:  ECG, a diagnostic test for atrial fibrillation. Your doctor will be able to visualize irregularities in your heartbeat and interpret new and ongoing issues with your heart.

"You cannot machine wash or hand wash suede slippers by submerging them. If you spill something on the suede, use a clean towel to blot and wipe at the spill.If the suede is waterproof, then you can use a damp towel to wipe at the spill. If not, stick with a dry towel., If the spill can stain the suede and you know the towel treatment alone will not suffice, then use a suede cleaning kit on the exterior.A suede cleaning kit will come with a stain eraser and a small, stiff suede brush with which to work in the eraser.A suede brush, nail file, or soft-textured sandpaper can also remove mud or scuff marks. This will also return the nap texture to the suede.Once the exterior of the slippers is clean, consider applying a suede-safe waterproofing spray to make cleaning them easier in the future., Baby wipes allow you to scrub out the slippers without wetting the suede. This works for both cotton and fleece-lined interiors.Baby wipes are low in moisture and have a mild detergent.Use a couple of them to work the inside of the slippers until you stop seeing the grime staining them.

"To create your own black nail polish, all you will need is a pan of black eyeshadow and some clear nail polish. Make sure that you choose a black color that you will like on your nails.If you want a matte black look, then go for a matte black nail polish. If you want something shimmery, then go for a shimmery black nail polish.  Choose a clear or matte top coat for the nail polish. If you use a clear coat, then your black nail polish will be slightly shiny. If you choose a matte top coat, then your nail polish will be matte.  You will also need a small container to mix your ingredients together and a stick to mix them with. Try using a Popsicle stick or a cuticle stick.;  , When you are ready to start mixing, begin scraping the eyeshadow into your dish. You will need about one to two teaspoons. Use the Popsicle stick to scrape off the top layer of the eyeshadow.  You may want to get a special black eye shadow for the purpose of making your black nail polish, or at least use one that you will not mind breaking into pieces.  If you want to create a matte polish and you did not use a matte clear coat polish, then you can add a couple of teaspoons of corn flour. The corn flour will give the nail polish a matte effect.  If you want to add corn flour then add it to the dish now.  Keep in mind that the corn flour might lighten the black color a bit. If you want a true black nail polish, then you may want to skip the corn flour.  Next, pour in the clear coat nail polish and begin mixing the nail polish in with the eyeshadow. Stir the mixture until there are no lumps and the color looks even. This might take a few minutes.  After you have combined the nail polish and eye shadow, it is ready to use! Transfer it into an empty nail polish bottle and try it out. You can use the clear coat nail polish bottle that you emptied to make the black nail polish.  You can use a small funnel or just pour slowly.  Make sure that you leave a little space in the bottle for shaking the nail polish.

"A common cycle with bingeing goes something like this: you feel bad, so you eat, which makes you feel bad, so you eat. Instead of beating yourself up for bingeing, treat yourself as you would your best friend, with kindness and understanding.  Counter negative self talk with positive statements. If a voice inside you says “I’m fat,” counter it with “I’m creative” or “I’m smart”, or whatever may apply that makes you feel good about yourself.  Treat yourself as you would a child. Would you tell a child that he or she was right if he/she said “I'm fat”? Maybe you would even ask, “What makes you say that?” Opening a dialogue with yourself may help you gain more insight into why you are binge eating.  It is important to focus less on the food side of things, and more on your own well-being. The food is likely not the problem. It’s more likely a symptom of something that you are struggling with on an emotional level.  These could include exercising, joining a class at your local community centre, learning a language — really anything that makes you feel good.  Try to write at least three pages each day, being sure to note the days when you feel the urge to binge. Being more in touch with your feelings and urges may help you to “reframe the problem from being one of ‘I’m hungry’ to one of ‘I’m feeling ignored or unimportant’ or whatever it might be, and line up the solutions for that,” according to Doug Bunnell, PhD., Studies have shown that visualization alone can have a measurable affect on the human body.Sit somewhere comfortable, close your eyes, and visualize yourself resisting the temptation to binge. Visualize yourself eating a healthy meal and stopping before you feel sick.We like to be right. Our brains will hold on to what we believe to be true, and will work to prove us right. If we think the world hates us, we will see evidence for that everywhere. If we think we are unhealthy and unworthy, we will do things like binge eat to prove ourselves right. You can reprogram your brain. Visualization and positive self talk help.  You may wish to start with a medical practitioner, who can suggest medications and/or refer you to a therapist and/or support group specializing in eating disorders. For many, therapy will be the ideal route as medications often carry with them drawbacks such as side effects and expense.If you do choose to take medication, combine it with therapy if possible.  There are a number of medications available to help you fight binge eating. These range from antidepressants to prescriptions designed to help with binge eating. As with most medications, there are significant side effects that must be understood, so it would be best to consult with your doctor on the best option for you.  Seek out either a local support group and/or join an online forum in which people openly discuss their struggles with binge eating. The following websites are good starting points, but you may also wish to do an Internet search that includes the city you live in plus the words “binge eating support” or “binge eaters”.

The next time you feel the urge to binge, you will know that there’s another option: to follow your plan.  If you find yourself struggling to go through with your plan, promise yourself to at least complete three of the steps before you give in and binge eat. As with many things, the hardest part is often starting. You may find that after three steps, you want to keep going with your plan, and the urge to binge eat might subside.  It is such an important step that it bears repeating. It is not fair to yourself to expect to go from bingeing to healthy eating immediately. Be patient and gentle with yourself. You will likely have good and bad days, and that’s okay. The important thing to remember is that every moment is an opportunity to start fresh. You don't have to wait until tomorrow to try again. Choose to be healthy now.

"Every floor of your house or apartment should have a working smoke alarm installed on a ceiling. Be sure to test them and replace their batteries regularly.It’s a good idea to replace the batteries in your smoke alarms twice a year.  If you’re often away from your home, it may be worth investing in a monitored smoke alarm system. That way, any time a smoke alarm is triggered in your absence, a service would immediately dispatch first responders to check on your house and rescue your dog if need be.  Use stickers placed on a window near your front door to notify first responders about any dogs or other pets living in your home. The sticker should state what kind of pets and how many of each you have in the family.The ASPCA provides these window-cling stickers at no charge in their free pet rescue packs, which you can order online.You may also obtain pet alert stickers in person from your local firehouse., Things are chaotic during a fire. In case your dog is lost in the melee, be sure to keep their microchipping and/or ID tags up to date with your current contact information.  Microchips correspond to an electronic database with owner information. Be sure to apprise your vet and/or the company where you purchased your microchip of any updates to your address or phone number.  Creating a doggy door that leads into a fenced yard is a good way to ensure that your pet can get out of the house in the event of a fire, even when you’re not there.If you crate your dog during your absence, it’s wise to keep the crate near an exterior door, so that they can be easily rescued in the event of a house fire.

"The library is excellent for this. Try to go to a library where you aren't well known. Don't bring attention to yourself with your clothing or actions. Avoid leaving a trail for investigators. For instance, do not ask librarians where to find the book or search for it in the card catalogue. If you're serious about stealth, don't even check out the book. Just read it at the library. Another way, would be to obtain a digital copy of the book by searching it online in google and then buying an e-book version of it. Reading on your laptop or tablet helps to read in privacy too.;  , Hide it under your coat, in your pocket, or in a bag. Take it into a secure location where you know you will not be found or seen.

If you share a room, make sure your roommate will not go through your stuff.  Do it alone whenever possible. Read it in the bathroom, but remember not to stay locked in for too long. Read it outside, in empty parks or hiking trails. Make sure you always have an alibi.  Drop it off as quietly and casually as possible. Act like it's an ordinary book. Place it face down on the counter, preferably underneath other books. Turn the spine away from others. You may want to stick around for a few minutes instead of suspiciously dashing away.  Make sure no one else is in sight when you do this.  Never quote the book or act knowledgeable about anything pertaining to it. This is often the hardest step because you will want to talk about your adventure. If you must talk about it, choose someone you trust or do it anonymously.

"Probably the simplest way to bring color into your garden is to take an old window frame and glue colored glass beads to it.  You should use glue such as E6000, which dries clear.  This can be displayed by standing it upright in a bed so that the sunlight comes through it.  Try anchoring it into the ground by attaching wooden stakes to the lower sides that can be driven at least 2 feet (0.6 m) into the ground for stability.  Silver or blue-tinted beads work well for giving the effect of bubbles.  The joy of old window art is bringing lots of translucent color into your garden.  You can try to source an old window with colored glass in – or create your own.  Add a colorful mosaic to an old colorless glass window by gluing on a pattern of glass beads, transparent colored mosaic tiles or even sea glass gathered from the beach.  You can source colored glass receptacles, such as kitchenware, from thrift stores and smash these up to make glass shards.  You’ll need to get some glass glue and a grout – try following an online glass mosaic tutorial.  Home Depot can source a grout that works well – ask for 100% solids epoxy grout when ordering ahead.  It can be fun to paint your own works of art onto blank windows.  Not all glass paint will survive out of doors and some will peel, so choose your paint carefully.  You may find it helps to wipe down the glass surface using alcohol before you paint.  Paints such as the Martha Stewart Glass range are said to be outdoor resistant.  Also try sealing using Polycrylic for added protection.  As some paints need to be baked in the oven to seal the paints, you can either try removing the glass pane from the window to do so, or alternately paint a separate bit of glass and simply glue this onto your old window pane.  Creating a mini greenhouse can be a great place to store plants in a colorful way.  You’ll need 6 small window frames of the same size and shape for this.  Make them safe by removing protruding nails and resealing the windows where needed.  Using hinges or small wooden blocks, attach 4 of the smaller windows to each other at right angles. This forms the 4 sides of your mini greenhouse.  Then use hinges to add a peaked roof using the last 2 windows.  Put some plants inside to finish it off. Remember, it will get pretty hot inside so choose plants that like heat and keep them well watered.  Remember, you don’t need to have glass in the frames of your old windows to use them in the garden.  In fact, empty panes will make a great place for birds to perch.  Try painting old window frames using distressed paint techniques.  Outdoor chalk paint also works well.  Hang these on chains on the edge of your porch, from a tree branch, or on a barn door.  A collection of frames painted different colors works well.  An old window can be hung on a fence to create the illusion of a real window.  This works especially well if you replace the glass panes with mirror panels.  It also helps create a sense of space in a small garden.  You can make a nice effect if you use a window with shutters.  Try painting these in a color that complements your fence.  Try some paint distressing techniques to create an aged effect.  You can use an old window as a planting display by adding a window box or ledge to your window and putting a planter in it or several plant pots on it.  Another nice effect can be achieved by taking some old metal food cans, making some drainage holes at the bottom using a screwdriver, painting them in bright colors and patterns, and nailing them to the window frame before planting in them.  This is a nice way to display plants against a colorful window frame.  Take an old window (or picture) frame that is empty of glass to create a plant frame.  Attach a small hook to the center of the inner frame at the upper side.  Attach a chain to this and hang a planter from it – a small bucket or basket planter works well for this.  This is a neat way to display a trailing plant.  It works nicely if you paint the frame in a color that complements your planter, and its flowers and foliage.  Gather a good collection of colorless cut glass plates and pot lids, decanter tops, and other clear glass items to create a glass mosaic.  Glue these to your clear glass window and fill in the spaces between them with clear glass beads or marbles.  The idea for this display is to make it colorless but emphasize the textures provided by the cut glass items you use.  Since garden art lives outdoors, it’s best to protect it before leaving it out for extended periods of time.  Remember that any wood in contact with soil will get wet and may start to rot.  To preserve the life of your garden art, treat it with a wood preservative if it is in contact with the ground, or raise it on a pressure-treated wood block.

"Begin by pouring out the volume of green gram you want into a fine colander or sieve. You need to wash the beans thoroughly before you try to sprout them. Rinse them in water three or four times to make sure that they are completely clean.If you are making a sprouted green gram salad, you should use about 1 cup of green gram per person.So if you are making a salad to serve two, sprout 2 cups of the beans.  You will be able to buy the beans from local grocery and health food stores.;  , Once you have thoroughly washed the beans you need to place them into a bowl and cover them with water. The water should completely cover the beans, with the beans about an inch below the surface of the water.  Do not use tap water for this. Soak the beans in water that has been boiled and then cooled to ensure it contains no contaminants.  Leave the beans to soak for at least seven or eight hours. You might want to leave them overnight.  After you have soaked the beans, put them in a sieve or colander and rinse them thoroughly until the water runs clear., Transfer your beans to a clean and dry container that you can close. After putting the beans in, close the lid and place the container somewhere warm. Leave them again for seven or eight hours, or overnight. After a day check them to see if they have sprouted.  If you leave them overnight you will most likely find the beans sprouting in the morning.If the beans haven't sprouted after a day, rinse them and drain them before returning them to the container.Most mung beans will sprout within 24 hours. If it takes longer than two days for the beans to sprout, then don't eat them raw. Cook before using.  Once your green gram has sprouted nicely they are ready to eat in whatever way you like. Be sure you rinse them thoroughly again before you eat them, especially if you are having them raw in a salad.  Green gram is often used in Indian cuisine as a base for dal, curry, and salads. You can also make a delicious Haleem stew with mutton and green gram.In Filipino cuisine, green gram is eaten with sautéed meat, garlic, onions and bay leaves.

"This quick method will allow you to simply and easily convert between metric units without having to perform any multiplication or division. To begin, all you need to know is whether you're converting from a small unit to a larger unit or vice versa, as well as the size of the conversion you're making - in other words, whether your desired units differ from your initial units by 101, 102, etc.  Both of these can be determined by counting spaces and/or drawing an arrow on a line of the metric prefixes. For example, if we want to convert from kilometers to decameters, we know that we're converting from a large unit to a small unit because we have to travel to the right along the line to get from 'kilo' to 'deca,' and we know that decameters are 102 times smaller than kilometers because 'kilo' and 'deca' are separated by two spaces.  Since two metric units always differ from each other by some multiple of ten, it's possible to make metric conversions simply by shifting your initial number's decimal point. When converting from a large unit to a smaller unit, shift the decimal point one digit to the right for each power of ten that your desired units differ from your initial units. When converting from a small unit to a larger unit, move the decimal place to the left. Remember that the power of ten by which your desired units differ from your initial units is given by the number of spaces apart the two units are on the line of prefixes.  For example, let's say that we want to convert 1 kilometer into centimeters. Since we can tell from the line of prefixes that centimeters are 105 times smaller than kilometers, we move the decimal point in '1' five spaces to the right. See below:  1.0  10.0  100.0  1,000.0  10,000.0  100,000.0. There are 100,000.0. centimeters in 1 kilometer.  You may also do the reverse - move a number's decimal to the left to convert to a larger unit.  When you move a number's decimal point, be sure to add zeroes for each space that you move the decimal point beyond the available digits. For instance, when converting 1 kilometer to centimeters, the decimal point is initially to the right of the number 1, as so: 1. Moving the decimal place to the right means you must insert a zero so that the number becomes 10.  The same principal applies when moving a decimal point to the left - begin inserting zeroes when you move the decimal beyond the number's available digits. For instance, let's say we want to convert 1 millimeter into meters. Since meters are 103 times larger than millimeters, we would simply move the decimal three spaces to the left as below:  1.0  0.10  0.010. Notice that we add a zero to the left of the 1.  0.0010. We add another zero to get our final answer. There are 0.001 meters in 1 millimeter.  Only add zeroes if you run out of digits when moving the decimal point. Inserting superfluous zeroes into the middle of a number can make your answer incorrect.  ","determine the direction and size of the conversion. move the decimal point in your measurement. add zeroes as necessary. "

"Not all family histories have to be massive recordings of multiple generations. You could just create a story of your immediate family -- your parents and siblings or your spouse and children.Get a rough idea of how far back in history you intend to search. This will help you decide what kinds of resources you need to explore.  In addition to deciding how many ancestors you want to include, you should also consider if there is a particular geographical location you want to stick to. If your ancestors immigrated, do you want to conduct research about their lives in another country or do you want to keep it centered in one specific location?;  , Similar to deciding on your scope, a clear research question will help guide your research. Is there a particular ancestral figure you want to focus on?For instance, do you want to know why one branch of your family moved to another region of the country? Do you want to know the source of an old feud with another family? Asking something specific will help you narrow your scope and then branch out into other information.Decide what you already know. How much information do your already have on your family? What gaps in knowledge exist? How do you intend to fill them?  , In the digital age, resources for finding information on your family can be easily accessed on the internet. Here are some types of records that can help you build a family history:Land deeds and records (often available about the National Archives' web site for the U.S. as well as the records division of your local county courthouse)  Census information (available at the U.S. Census Bureau's web site)  Military records (National Archives)  Ship passenger arrival records and land border entries (National Archives and The Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation Inc. web sites)  Engagement/wedding announcements, birth announcements and obituaries (often in local newspapers or church bulletins)  School yearbooks or old transcripts (usually available from the person's alma mater)  Legal documents such as wills and testaments (also available at their corresponding courthouse)  Church registries (check with local churches if you know your family has a history there)  Old letters, journals or diaries from ancestors (ask older relatives if they have these)  Family recipes and/or cookbooks  , While records and written documents will give you important facts, visual sources will make your history more engaging to read. Look for old family photographs, maps of land, posters, postcards, and newspaper clippings to include. Nothing will make your history feel more alive than actual depictions of your ancestors.Look for other physical items such as childhood toys, clothing, jewelry, kitchenware, and mementos/keepsakes kept by your older family members to include in your family history. These items will give you a sense of your relatives' tastes and interests beyond a basic genealogical record.  Genealogy libraries specialize in resources for finding your family history. They often include extensive microfilm collections where you can read a variety of helpful sources all in one space.Some of the most well-known genealogy libraries in the U.S. include the Library of Congress, the New York Public Library, the Midwest Genealogy Center, the Family History Center in Salt Lake City, the New England Historic Genealogical Research Center Library, and the Clayton Library Center for Genealogical Research in Houston.You may find that taking the time to visit one of these libraries will actually save you time in the long run because of the wealth of resources they provide all in one place.  You should also check your local library system to see what kind of genealogical resources they provide.  If you are limited in your ability to travel to libraries, then try to use on-line resources. Web sites such as Ancestry, AfriGeneas, Find A Grave, Archives.com, and Genealogy provides lots of great tips for starting your family history.They will often provide timelines and checklists so you can properly organize the information that you are gathering and save it in a digital space.  On-line resources will also be convenient for sharing materials and records with other family members if you don't plan to send a physical copy of your family history to many readers., Sometimes the best historical sources are your current relatives. As you are gathering information, structure your interview around want you want to know. Do you want to hear about a particular time or period in this subject's life or do you want a general overview of their family history?Schedule the interview for a time and place that is convenient for your subject. This may be in their own home or in a more public place.  Document the interview. You should plan to take notes during the discussion -- don't just assume that you will remember everything afterwards. If you don't want to take notes, try to record the interview with a recorder or video camera.Ask important questions. These should include fact-finding questions (like the names of relatives/dates of important events), but you can also ask substantial questions about family traditions or customs, family trips, and how your subject related to their local communities.  Respect sensitive subjects. Over the course of a person's life, they may experience something very painful or have a moment they do not want to revisit. Respect your interviewee when they say they don't want to discuss something -- don't push them or make them feel uncomfortable.If you do not know your interview subject well, consider asking if a close friend or relative of theirs will accompany you during the interview. This might make your subject more comfortable while they are talking to you if you are a stranger., Some genealogical histories are simply lists of names, birth and death dates, marriages and offspring. While this is a good place to start, it probably won't give a very in-depth view of the personalities belonging to the people in your family.Focus on narrating the story of your family rather than simply making lists on a family tree. Give details about your ancestors based on the research you have compiled. Did the family suffer financial ruin at one point? Did they have any disputes in court? Did anyone commit a major crime? These are the kind of substantial details that can make your history a compelling text to read.  Consider if you want to divide sections of your history by time or by geography. For example, if one branch of your family is from one state, but another branch of the family still lives in a different country, consider dividing the family history into regional or geographical sections rather than by a historical timeline.  If you are putting your history into a book format, you should have some tools that will make it easily accessible for your reader. The most helpful tools will be a Table of Contents (so your reader knows how the history is structured) and then an Index of Names at the back.  The Index will be especially helpful to a reader who wants to learn about one member of the family in particular., You don't have to follow each family member's life from the moment of their birth to their death. Opening a chapter with the sentence, 'Beauregard Fortiscue was born on October 9, 1875' will often put the reader to sleep because they already sense the arc of this story.Instead, open with a compelling anecdote about your subject. Have you found a long lost love letter from Beauregard to his wife? Do you have evidence that he was entangled in a bitter land dispute with a neighbor? These are more compelling stories to use as an introduction to his history and they will hook your reader early on.  There are number of style guides you can use for correctly citing your sources, such as the Chicago Manual of Style or Modern Language Association style book. Pick one style guide and apply it to the sources in your project.You will generally need to cite a source whenever you directly quote from it or whenever you refer to it generally (as when you paraphrase or summarize a section from it).  Most citations require the name of the author of the source, the date it was published, and the title of the work (such as The Journal of Beauregard Fortiscue, 1888-89).  Sources from records such as the census or other similar documents should also be cited. Consult the style guide for specific instructions on how to cite it properly.  The best way to improve your writing is to get feedback from other readers. Consider joining a local writing group (often hosted at local libraries or community centers).If you have some extra money, you can also consider taking a class in non-fiction writing at your local college to help improve your writing skills.  Writing groups will also give you a set of deadlines to meet while you are drafting your project.  You can also hire a proofreader to help you with this if you want to spend more time focusing on the content of the story. Try looking for local freelance writers or even asking students in a graduate writing program if they want to take on a side project., Self-publishing might be the best route for your family history; it is likely that your broadest audience is your own family (and future family members), so most major publishers will not take on your project. But there are lots of options for self-publishing today:Look for local printers who use Xerox DocuTech if you only want to print a limited number of copies. These are often lower-cost options that also provide a quick turnaround.Consider print-on-demand publishing. On web sites like Lulu, you can print one book at a time directly from a computer file (rates begin at $13 for 24 pages). This is a good option if you think you might only want a couple copies of your history.You can also turn your history into an e-book for free on web sites like Scribd., While you might assume that your family history should take the form of a book, there are many other formats to consider as well.  The website PlaceStories allows you to pick notable addresses on a digital map and then attach stories to them. You can consider using this site if you want to base your history geographically.Vlog your research. You can also make a series of videos in which you discuss your research and then upload them to sites such as YouTube or Vimeo if you want to orally tell the story of your family.Consider using a digital newsletter that you can email to your friends and family. Each newsletter can feature a story about a different relative in your family history and it will present the information in easily digestible chunks as opposed to one long book. You can use services like MailChimp or ConstantContact to create these kinds of newsletters and mailing lists.  In a survey conducted by Ancestry.com, more than 67% of users reported that learning about their family histories made them feel wiser; a majority of users also reported that it helped them feel closer to older relatives.If you have been looking for a way to get closer to relatives you don't know very well or whom you have lost touch with, then researching a family history can be a great way to do this.  If your family belongs to a marginalized or oppressed group, writing a family history can also help you dismantle racist or stereotypical narratives about your family's ethnic or religious background. Writing can become an act of empowerment for your family and broader community., Writing can have significant benefits for your mental and physical health. Studies have shown that writing can ease symptoms of depression and anxiety.It has also been show to reduce symptoms in cancer patients.Not surprisingly, the mental work of writing has also been shown to boost your memory.

"Loose cubic zirconia stones are generally colorless, but many shades of colors can be added using trace elements during the manufacturing process.;  , Clarity, or clearness, of loose cubic zirconia is a quality factor. The manufacturing process can sometimes cloud a stone, making visible imperfections. Just as with genuine diamonds, the clearer the stone is, the greater the value.  Cut is very important in determining the quality for loose cubic zirconia stones. Just as with diamonds, the cut reveals the stone's beauty through every facet. The facets must be even and precise to create just the right appearance. As with diamonds, the skill of the stone cutter makes all the difference because stone cutters do much more than cut. They analyze the stone carefully to determine how much of the stone should be cut off to give proper clarity. Then, they take many steps to perfect their cut without taking away from the stone.  The Brilliant cut is the standard  There are other popular cuts such as the Trillion, Princess, and Radiant cuts.  There are also a variety of shapes to give each stone its own unique personality.

"The GPS market is flooded with different devices, options, and features. Unless you plan on using your GPS in the wilderness or for research experiments, however, your smart phone or a car GPS, can provide directions and your location quickly and easily. Most have touch screens and come with a rechargeable battery.  Smart Phones: Most smart phones come pre-loaded with a 'Maps,' or 'Directions' app that uses GPS. If you do not have one, search and download an app, like Google Maps, from your app store to use GPS.GPS Devices: These are small, rectangular devices that specialize in driving directions and finding restaurants, airports, and other points of interest. Examples include TomTom and Garmin, and most cost under $170 dollars.;  , This is the basic screen for a GPS. It shows a location, usually with your current location at the center, and all of the roads and major landmarks nearby.  Some GPS use touch screens, others have keypads, and some have scroll wheels and buttons. Click on the button labeled with a compass, navigational arrow, or crosshairs to show your current location.  Your location is sometimes stored under the heading 'Where am I?' 'Favorite Locations,' or 'Current.'  iPhone users can see their current location using the built-in Compass App. Make sure you 'Allow Location Services' for the compass under 'Settings' → 'Privacy' → 'Location Services' → 'Compass'  , Using the search bar found at the top of your GPS, type in the address you want to reach. Many touch screen GPS's let you choose a location by holding your finger on the location in the map.  Some GPS's will prompt you with a button labeled 'Get Directions.' Choose this if there is no search bar to input an address.  If you know the exact latitude and longitude of your trip, use these; they will give you the most accurate location possible.  The GPS will give you directions at every turn you need to take. Don't worry if you miss a turn -- most GPS will auto-correct and give you a new route to get back on track.  If you are struggling to keep up, check your GPS's settings and make the 'Turn Warning Frequency' setting longer -- giving you more time to hear the next direction.

"The water should be about room temperature—not too warm and not too cold.

"If you are dehydrated, your epidermis (the outer layer of your skin) dries out along with the rest of you. As a result, your skin will lose its smoothness and bounce. If you already drink enough water, though, extra won’t really help your skin.Make sure you drink at least eight 8-oz glasses (2 liters) each day.;  , More and more, dermatologists are emphasizing the connection between what you eat and how your skin looks — from acne and greasiness to fine lines and wrinkles. This isn’t the old-fashioned “chocolate causes acne” warning, though — in fact, dark chocolate contains many of the antioxidants that are at the center of a skin-friendly diet. The latest research focuses on avoiding processed foods and adding in more natural ones.Try a Mediterranean diet, which focuses on fresh fruits and vegetables, Omega-3 rich fish, olive oil, and whole grains. In addition to heart-healthy compounds and antioxidants galore, this diet has even been shown to protect against skin cancer.Sources of Omega-3 fatty acids include vegetable oils such as flaxseed, canola,and soybean oils. These are good oils to cook with.Some people argue that drinking apple cider vinegar can reduce acne by balancing your pH level. If you’re up for it, try a tablespoon each day.  Limit your intake of salt, which can cause puffiness.  Be aware of foods that are high in iodine, like shrimp, crab, and lobster. A buildup of iodine can lead to acne, so dermatologists recommend eating these foods only a few times a month.  Try giving up dairy. There is no consensus on whether dairy causes acne, but some people have had success with eliminating it from their diets.Some doctors trace this possible connection to the hormones found in dairy products, with skim milk seeming to be the worst culprit.Keep in mind that dairy can show up in unexpected places, including many processed foods, where it masquerades as dairy protein.  Avoid foods that are high on the glycemic index, a measure of how much something spikes your blood sugar. These include things like white bread, pasta, and sweets, as well as sugary drinks like soda and juice.  Beware of added sugar. You know it’s in candy bars, but would you expect it to be in pasta sauce? Read labels carefully — it’s everywhere. There are over 50 different names for added sugar that might appear on a label (and there may be more than one in a product), including high fructose corn syrup, dextrose, fructose, fruit juice, molasses, sucrose, and rice syrup.  Limit your consumption of alcohol. Alcohol dehydrates you, emphasizing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles and possibly setting off a rosacea outbreak.  When your body experiences stress, it releases the hormone cortisol, which can lead to breakouts. Stress can also trigger an outbreak of hives, along with many autoimmune disorders. All told, it can affect acne, eczema, rosacea, and more, so do your absolute best to keep it at a minimum.In a study, acne and psychological stress levels were evaluated, suggesting that there was a significant correlation between stress and acne, especially males. The correlation may or may not be due to an increase in sebum secretion., Getting sweaty helps to increase blood flow, making the process of carrying materials to and from cells more efficient. By exercising, you’ll be helping your blood carry waste—including skin-damaging free radicals—away from your cells.As a bonus, it is also one of the best ways to reduce stress., While the efficacy of vitamins in general is hotly debated, some experts recommend taking supplements to improve your skin. While multivitamins can help fill in any nutritional gaps, Vitamin A, Vitamin D, Omega-3s, and Biotin are among the supplements sometimes recommended for specific skin problems.

"One of the biggest changes to make is to let go of trying to control the outcome of every situation. Realize that the only thing you can control is your reaction to a situation, you rarely (if ever) can control the situation itself. The need for control is rooted in fear, and if you're acting from a place of fear, you are not loving life.Ask yourself what you're afraid of if you relinquish the need to control the outcome of a given situation. As an example, if you feel your girlfriend forgetting the wine for a big evening is going to ruin the evening, question that assumption. Will it actually be ruined? It could be that your attitude will actually ruin the evening, rather than the lack of wine.  For example: If you're just embarking on a relationship (or just looking), it's fine to plan ahead for where you'd like to see the relationship go, as long as you remain open-minded to the fact that it may not end up how you originally planned or envisioned it to be.  Another example is if you have a health issue (of any kind). Instead of holding a constant anger about the situation, remember that you can't control the health issue (although you can do things to help or make it worse), you can only control how you act about the situation.;  , This doesn't mean that you can twist your body into a pretzel shape, this means that you are open to different possibilities. It ties in with letting go of the need to control the outcome, because if you aren't acting in a flexible manner towards life, you're going to come up against something that will break you., Always thinking about others is loving and living your life. Do what you want to do as this life is yours and you have to operate it. Do not be distracted by any one in your life with your aim.  Even in the best zone and even in the worst zone, you value is similar everytime. Read the following and you will realize it.  Once during a office break, one of the employee of the office raising a 20$ currency note in his hands. Doing this, he ask to his colleagues that who want that. Almost every person every person present raise there hand wanting it. After that he crushed it from his hand and then showed it raising his hand. This time too people raise there hand. But third time he crushed it under his brander shoes. Then he bent to take that currency and then shows to other asking that even now who want this. everyone raise there hand. From the story we moralize that even in the worst conditions we are, our value is the same in the society like the 20$ currency note that the employee showed to his co workers.  Question your thoughts and words. Look at what you're thinking and saying (especially if it has to do with why you can't do something). You'll start to notice the places where you're most rigid in your thinking and your actions and you'll be able to work on softening those areas.  Change up your regular routine. They don't have to be big changes, but doing something a little different each day keeps you on your toes, even if it's something as simple as taking a different route to work each day, or stopping at a different coffee shop occasionally.  Everyone has problems, big or small. Ignoring or avoiding them only makes them get bigger and bigger until they've taken over your life. You don't have to face them all at once, but dealing with things as they arise, rather than waiting, will help your long-term ability to love life, because problems won't be building up.  Focus on finding a solution to the problem, rather than focusing on the problem itself. For example, if you're having a problem with your roommate, instead of focusing the problem itself and building it up, focus on what both of you need to do to make the living situation work.  Ask yourself whether a problem is actually a problem. Sometimes you build something up into a problem without realizing why. For example: if making telephone calls makes you anxious, ask yourself why that is. Forcing yourself to come up with a reason for something that seems nonsensical can actually help you release the anxiety around what you feel is a problem.  Sometimes the thing you need the most to get re-energized and life-loving is to take a break from everything. This means taking a little time to pamper yourself, or simply to give yourself some much needed rest.  Take a warm bath and put on an audiobook or music to listen to so your mind doesn't focus on all the things that might be worrying you.  Let yourself do nothing but day-dream for awhile. Maybe you take the bus to work or school everyday. Use this time to zone-out and catch up on imagination time, something that's important for your overall health and productivity.  Do something fun. This can be anything, big or small (anywhere from reading a book you love to going on vacation), as long as it is something that allows you to take a break from everything.  People are always saying that laughter is the best medicine and strangely enough, it is something that can greatly help your health and your mood. Laughing helps increase your blood flow, heightens your immune response, help relaxation and sleep. It can even help lower blood sugar levels.Put on your favorite comedy, or take a youtube break, if you're feeling stressed. The laughter will help you lower your stress levels.  Get together with your friends and reminisce about your favorite, ridiculous moments. Laughing with others helps you feel supported and cultivates a more positive attitude.  Your health has such a huge influence on your emotions and your attitudes about things. It can be really hard to love life when you've got the flu or even a really bad cold. Doing everything you can to maintain your health will help your attitude towards life.  Exercise releases chemicals that boost your mood, help to fight depression, and help your sleep patterns. Even getting only a small amount of exercise each day is beneficial. So take a walk, go for a run, do some yoga, or even just put on some music and dance!Drink lots of water. Water is necessary for your health. Getting dehydrated can make you less able to function and feel bad. Try to drink at least 8 glasses of 8 ounces of water each day (try to avoid drinks that are high in sugar or caffeine, since these can dehydrate you). Optimally, shoot for half your body weight in Ounces. (Example: if you weigh 150lbs., aim for at least 75oz. of water.)  Eat a balanced diet. Avoid sugar and processed foods as much as possible (the occasional indulgence is fine!). Stick to eating lots of fruits and vegetables and protein, or good carbohydrates (like brown rice, quinoa, whole grains, oats).  Get enough sleep. Getting enough sleep helps boost your immune system, helps to deal with depression and sickness. The optimum amount of sleep is 8-9 hours each night and if you can't do that, try to take a nap sometime during the day.  To love life you need to be willing to try out new things and to challenge yourself to do things that may make you nervous. Part of loving life and being happy is to not be ruled by fear, which will suffocate you in unhappiness.  Start small, especially if you have a lot of anxiety about doing new things. Take up knitting or cooking in the privacy of your own home. You learn a lot from YouTube tutorials on the subject and you'll be learning a useful skill.  The more you try new things and get outside your comfort zone, the easier it will be to do so. It takes practice to deal with your fear of trying new things.  Don't punish yourself if you end up not being able to do something (like skydiving, or or traveling somewhere far away by yourself). There will always be things that you can't or won't be able to do. That's okay! Try something else instead.  Singing, especially in a group, releases chemicals (endorphins and oxytocin) that make us feel good and happy and help to lower stress. Group singing lets you feel bonded to other people and part of a community, which is an added support system that can help you feel safe and which alleviates depression and loneliness. Look around your city or town to see if there's a community singing group that you can join. If not, think about starting one. You can even do it just with your friends and you can sing any songs you want!  Singing alone is also beneficial, since it helps regulate your breathing in the same way that yoga does, and is a good way to relax.  You might be thinking, 'but I can't sing.' You don't have to be the next Katy Perry to enjoy singing. If you don't want to sing in front of other people because you think you're not good enough, then shut your bedroom door and sing quietly to yourself.  This means using your time, your energy, and/or your money to help other people. When you practice philanthropy, you'll find yourself gaining a sense of perspective and of purpose. Philanthropy can also help reduce your stress and anxiety, while giving you a chance to connect with other people.Find a local soup kitchen, or shelter to volunteer at. Make a point to volunteer at least once a month (or even once a week). There are lots of different kinds of shelters (battered women's shelters, family shelters, even animal shelters).  Doing something as simple as helping a family member or friend can be an act of philanthropy. You could take someone to a doctor's appointment, or help someone move into a new apartment. You could make your family a meal (if that's something you don't usually do), or offer to wash your parents' car.  Mindfulness means being in the moment instead of racing ahead towards the future or being mired in the past, two things that make it hard to focus on loving life and being happy.Do one action mindfully. This could be something as simple as eating your dinner, or sitting down to do your homework. Notice things like the taste of whatever you're eating and what the texture is like. Is it crunchy? Is it hot? Is it salty? Don't place a value judgment on it, like it's too hot, or it tastes gross, because that will have you focus on the negative, rather than being neutral.  Take 20 minutes every day and practice breathing mindfully. Draw in breath for a certain number of counts (say, 4 counts) and then release it for two extra counts (say, 6 counts). Watch your belly rise and fall as you breathe deeply. If your mind starts to wander, simply draw it back to the counting.  Take a 5 minute break. If you have a short period between classes or during your work hours, take a moment to look out of the window instead of immediately going to check your phone or your email. Notice what it looks like outside, what the weather is doing, what color the sky is. Again, don't assign value judgments to the things that you're noticing.  being grateful and practicing gratitude means that you celebrate the things that have happened in your life, taking nothing for granted and valuing your experiences. Practicing gratitude can help you feel better about life and about yourself and can help you feel happier.Maintain a gratitude journal, where you record the things that you're grateful for (like having a roof over your head and food to eat, or having your health), note people that you're grateful for and the kindnesses that you've experienced.  Notice the small things. The small things are really what make your life either so much easier or so much harder. Focus on things like the warmth of your jacket on a cold winter day, or eating a delicious cupcake, or something nice someone said to you.  Discuss what you're grateful for. Talk to a trusted family member, friend, or therapist about the things that you're grateful for. This will help you to remember the good things about your day and decrease your awareness or focus on the more difficult things.  You can set and work towards big, long-term goals, but make sure that you set smaller goals that you can achieve more quickly. This will help you feel accomplished and remind you that you can do things!  Make a goal to clean your room or house once a month. You can put on some music and sing along as you work and you'll feel incredibly accomplished and neat once you've finished.  Don't beat yourself up if you can't accomplish something, or can't accomplish it in the time frame you wanted. Instead, ask yourself what you learned from the experience and what you might do different next time. Framing it as a learning experience rather than a failure will help keep you more productive and happier.  Negative thoughts are bad for both your mind and your body and they can color the way you perceive everything. Now having stray negative thoughts is completely normal, but dwelling on them is not healthy. You'll want to focus on the positive, rather than the negative if you want to love life.Don't let your negative thoughts linger. When they pop up, acknowledge them and let them go. For example if a thought pops up saying 'I'm ugly' say to yourself 'I'm having a thought that I'm ugly. Is this a useful thought?' and let it go.  Don't focus on the past or the future too much. Obsessing over the things that have gone wrong in previous moments won't help you to live fully in the moment you're in. Likewise, worrying about what the future will bring, or simply looking forward only to the future, will keep you from being here and now. If you find your thoughts skittering backwards and forwards, draw attention to something in the moment: a tree, your breath, the rain against the window.  Whatever is happening, remember this, too, shall pass. You won't always be stuck in a traffic jam, just as you won't always have fantastic light karma. Reminding yourself that these situations are only momentary, will help you let go of them more easily.

"One of the most common forms of biphobia is the denial of the very existence of bisexuality. Sometimes this denial is caused by malice, but just as often it is the result of misinformation.  Reputable studies clearly indicate that bisexuality is a very real fact of life for many people. Actually, one recent study revealed that more Americans self-identify as bisexual (3.1%) than gay or lesbian (2.5%). This would indicate that there are roughly ten million self-identified bisexuals in the U.S.Often, a denial of bisexuality is based more on the assumption that it is a temporary situation within a transition between hetero- and homosexuality. The typical view in this sense is that “bisexual” simply means “on the way to gay.”However, although it may not fit neatly into the binary views of existence (gay / straight, male / female, etc.) that many people tend to embrace, bisexuality is a very real state of being in and of itself.;  , Those who do accept the existence of genuine bisexuality, and may even consider themselves supportive, can still harbor misconceptions and stereotypes that can add up to a less virulent but still harmful biphobia. Curiosity and questions should be welcomed, but “loaded” questions that indicate a prejudicial point of view need not be seen as acceptable.Some assumptions are clearly prejudicial, such as saying that a bisexual is just “confused” or “lying to himself,” needs to “make up her mind already,” is “trying to have it all” or avoid the difficulties of being identified as homosexual, is “just going through a phase,” or is just “trying to look cool.” Even if there is supportive intent, such statements denigrate the distinctive existence of bisexuality.  You have every right to respond to such questions or views by clarifying that bisexuals are not “undecided” or “confused” — they are living life on their terms. Don’t be hostile or judgmental yourself, especially when dealing with someone who wants to be supportive; educate them on what it means to be bisexual.  Many people simply place people in the binary categories of “heterosexual” or “not heterosexual,” often with the first option as the only “right” one. In so doing, they conflate homosexuals, bisexuals, and anyone else who does not fit neatly into these two supposedly rigid categories.Some people will simply have trouble believing that a bisexual is anything other than a homosexual who is literally “trying to have it both ways” out of confusion or convenience. Be prepared to address the differences between homosexuality and bisexuality, while confirming their equal rights to respect and tolerance.  Even as a bisexual (or advocate for them), then, it pays to understand common prejudices more specifically targeted toward homosexuals as well. See How to Deal With Homophobia as a good reference.  Not surprisingly, you will find some of the strongest champions for bisexual rights among the gay and lesbian communities. At the same time, however, some people who crusade against homophobia can actually espouse strong biphobia, for various reasons.Advocates for gay and lesbian equality sometimes express biphobia because they see bisexuals as only “half” of an oppressed minority, or because they are defensive about guarding the unity and priorities of their specific cause.Homosexuals can be misinformed about bisexuality just as easily as heterosexuals, but are perhaps more likely to respond to reasoned discussions of the challenges and prejudices bisexuals face on a daily basis.  While a good deal of biphobia will be based on misinformation, confusion, or good intentions improperly expressed, it can be expressed in more virulent forms as well. Bullies target differences and perceived weaknesses, often seeking to avoid or ignore their fears or problems by attacking others.Identifying the likely causes of someone’s biphobic bullying can help you to counteract it. Understanding does not mean accepting or legitimizing the bullying, though. Consider factors like peer pressure, social / religious background, or factors unrelated to bisexuality that may be causing the person to lash out at a perceived “flaw” in someone else.  If you’re lucky, a healthy conversation with the bully may be enough to convince him to stop the behavior — if not necessarily change his mind on bisexuality. But, if you are subject to ongoing bullying (for whatever reason), never hesitate to talk to people you trust, like friends, teachers, counselors, etc.If you are harmed or fear for your safety, by all means contact the authorities. No one has to tolerate bullying.  ","deny their denials. address common misconceptions. plan for biphobia conflated with homophobia. counter possible biphobia from supporters of gay and lesbian rights. understand bullying motivations. don't stand for bullying, though.

"Only use enough foundation or concealer to hide imperfections. Don't make it look obviously done. Emo makeup on boys is usually a bit more subtle than on girls.  Most Emo guys don't wear foundation or concealer but it can be a good technique if you have blemishes or scars.  If using concealer, use the stick form as it goes on evenly and blends well. Tap your fingertips or use a concealer brush to blend it.  Put it carefully onto your lash line in one continuous line to give a smooth final result. Keep the line as close to your lashes as possible.  The amount of eyeliner you apply depends on personal preference so try out different looks at home to find one you like.  You can use a liquid liner to define and clean up the edge of your eyeliner.  This is optional but if you decide to apply eyeshadow then try to use a light amount and stay away from bright neon colours.  Charcoal eyeshadow is a good choice.

"To clean the tank, you first need to place your crab in a holding container so you can give the tank and the accessories a good clean. The container can be a clean plastic tub or bin. Your crab will likely run around the holding container while you clean his tank.You can leave a small bowl of dechlorinated water out and place it next to the holding container so it comes to room temperature. You can then use this bowl later to clean any mites on your pet so he is mite free when he goes back into his clean, mite free tank.;  , If you’d really like to make sure there are no mites left in the tank at all, you can use a small vacuum to suck out any mites in the tank. Do this before you wet the tank, as the vacuum will work better on a dry surface. Focus on the corners of the tank as this is where the mites tend to like to hang out.  Once you have removed the accessories, you can wipe down the tank with a wet paper towel. Press down on the sides and bottom the tank to swish any mites and remove them. Make sure you do this in the corners of the tank, as this is often where the mites like to hide.You can also rinse the tank out with tap water to drown and wash away any mites still in the tank. Try to eliminate any black flecks in the tank so the tank is spotless and clean.  Mites do not like direct sunlight, so once you rinse and wipe down the tank with plain water, you should let it dry completely in the sun.You can also let the tank dry indoors overnight. Once the tank is dry, you can place the sterilized tank accessories back into the tank.  If you do not mind saying goodbye to your crab’s tank accessories, including any substrate on the floor of the tank such as sand, you can dispose of them. This is the easiest way to get rid of the mites in his tank, as this will ensure your crab’s tank does not contain any infected accessories or substrates.You should also throw away any toys that your crab played with in the tank, as these are likely also infested with mites.  Dispose of them by placing them in a garbage bag and removing the garbage bag to the garbage bin right away. This will prevent the mites from crawling back into the tank or from getting into other areas of your home.  If you cannot afford to throw out the tank accessories, you can boil them to get rid of the mites and place them back in your crab’s tank. Use distilled water to boil any substrate, like gravel, any rocks, and any tank accessories for at least 20 minutes. This includes food dishes, extra shells, and climbing toys like coral. This will help to sterilize the accessories and get rid of the mites.Allow the accessories to cool before you place them back in the tank.  Another option is to bake any substrate, such as sand, gravel, or pieces of wood, on a cookie sheet. Bake them for at least half an hour and allow them to cool before placing them back in the tank.If you are worried about burning pieces of wood in the oven, you can sterilize the wood in your microwave. Put them in the microwave for two minutes and keep an eye on the wood to ensure it does not catch fire.  While the crab’s tank is drying, you should give him a good clean too so he does not bring mites back into the tank. Use room temperature dechlorinated water to give your crab a bath at least one to two times.Place your crab in the bowl of water. Turn your crab upside down to get all the air bubbles out of his shell. Then, pour the water off your crab into the bowl. The mites will drain off your crab along with the water. Pour out the mites in the water, down the drain of your sink. Do this once more or until all the mites on your crab are gone. Make sure there are no mites in your crab’s shell.  You can also use a paper towel to squish any of the mites on your crab gently and carefully. Draining, wiping, and rinsing your crab should all help to remove the mites.  You can get mite specific medication for hermit crabs from a vet that specializes in arthropods or from an exotic pet supply store. This is a good option if you have tried the plain water method and the boiling method, but the mites still have not gone away., Commercial mite spray that is not specified for use on hermit crabs can hurt your crab. They should not be used on your crab or on the tank.You should also avoid using bleach solution to clean your crab and your crab’s tank. There is a high amount of chlorine in bleach that can blister your crab’s gills and make him ill.  To prevent the mites from reappearing in your crab’s tank, you should give the tank a thorough weekly clean. To clean the tank effectively, you should remove your crab from the tank and place him in a holding container. You can then use the plain water method to clean the tank and boil or bake the tank contents to sterilize them.If you keep a sponge in your crab’s tank to boost the humidity, you should smell the sponge to ensure it smells clean and not rotten. If it smells rotten, you should replace it. You can also place the sponge in the microwave and nuke it for several minutes to kill any mites.  Clean the lid of the tank, if you have one, once a day to keep pests like mites from getting into the tank. You may want to consider taping down the lid of the tank to prevent dust and pests from floating into your crab’s tank.  Avoid keeping live plants near your crab’s tank, as plants can attract their own pests, including mites. The mites can then move from the live plant into your crab’s tank.  Mites are often attracted by your crab’s food and can burrow into the food, such as dried shrimp and plankton-type crab food. You can try feeding your crab only dry food for a little while, as strong smelling wet foods or fresh foods can attract mites.You should also remove all crab droppings in the tank on a daily basis and replace your crab’s water in his water dishes to keep it clean.  You should take some time every day to give your hermit crab a mite check up. Examine him in the light for any small moving specks on his shell or on other parts of his body.If you notice that he has any mites on his body, you should give him a full immersion bath in dechlorinated water and do a thorough cleaning of his tank and the tank contents. This is the only way to ensure the mites are eliminated from your crab and his tank, and have a lower chance of coming back.  ","place your crab in a holding container. use a small vacuum to remove the mites in the tank. wipe down the tank with plain water to remove any mites still in the tank. let the tank dry in direct sunlight. dispose of the tank accessories, if possible. boil the tank accessories for at least 20 minutes. bake any oven safe accessories at 300 degrees fahrenheit. wash your crab in a small bowl of dechlorinated water. use mite specific medication for hermit crabs. do not use mite spray on your crab or your crab’s tank. keep the tank clean. remove any spoiled food in the tank. check your crab for mites on a daily basis.

"Many people find that the landscape of their social circle changes after a marriage ends. You and your spouse may have shared friends who now have to pick a side. Other friends may not be as interested in you as a single person, or you no longer have common interests. Make a point to seek out new friendships with people who reflect your personal values.Connect with people through your professional network, parenting groups, social and political organizations, volunteer commitments or religious/spiritual groups. You might also make friends by participating in a support group for divorced people or joining a local Meetup.  Keep in mind that there is often a secondary loss of friends and family members who do not approve of divorce, and who are no longer there for you.  There’s no better time to revive old passions or explore new ones than after a divorce. You may find your social calendar has more free space, so fill up those empty hours doing activities you enjoy. Pursuing a hobby also helps you connect with potential friends.Think about an activity that you have always been interested in, but never tried. Find a class or group in your area and sign up immediately. Don’t second-guess the decision—just go for it.  A great way to reinvent yourself post-divorce is by creating new memories. Identify a place, near or far, that you would like to visit and plan a trip. You can ask close friends or family to join you, or venture out on your own., There’s no better way to send the message that you’re starting over than an actual makeover.

Go shopping for new pieces that flatter your body and compliment your skin tone.  Many people also like to replace the marital bed, and re-do the bedroom in their own style.  Dating is a tricky area post-divorce. Some loved ones will hound you with blind date proposals. Others will remind you that you should “take your time.” Ignore others’ advice and tune in to yourself and your own needs. You might be ready to date three months after your divorce, or you may decide to wait a year. It’s completely up to you.When you do decide to date, don’t take yourself so seriously. Try not to focus on finding “the one.” Instead, have fun casually meeting new people and going to interesting places.

Retexturing walls is a messy process, so make sure all plastic drop cloths overlap.;  , Drywall joint compound is a common contractor's tool. It is used to create the smooth finish on top of drywall. It is also a good canvas for retexturing walls. You will retexture immediately after you apply the drywall joint compound, so if you are working alone, work on 1 wall at a time.  Understand that some of the joint compound will be wiped off during the texturing process. Put on more joint compound than you expect to have on the final product.  How you retexture your wall may largely depend on what instruments you use.  Use a small whisk broom to create the look of grass cloth on a wall. Grass cloth is a cloth that is woven from plant fibers. It resembles linen and is commonly used as wallpaper. By taking the whisk broom and gently gliding it vertically down the wall to the bottom, and then starting again at the top, you can create this cloth-like texture on your wall.  Drag a thick hair comb or paint comb vertically down the wall to create a texture of thick and even vertical lines. You can also comb in an overlapping 'S' curve with the paint comb, to create a curvy, textured line.  Use a thick-bristled brush to create circles. Leaving the brush in the same position, simply turn it around in one revolution. This should create the look of a circle. Wipe the joint compound off the brush before the next revolution.  To create vertical beading on your walls, take a window squeegee and cut grooves in it that are a few inches (cm) apart, depending upon how close you would like your beads to be. Start at the top and move the squeegee vertically down the wall. Use a straight motion and a steady hand to create long straight beads, or move back and forth to create a squiggled bead.  To create a woven look, take the squeegee and draw vertical lines, then drag it horizontally to create boxes that resemble woven fabric.  To create longer textured curves, use a process called skip troweling. Take a trowel and lightly brush the wet drywall joint compound at 3 to 6 inch (8 to 15 cm) intervals. Let the compound dry and then lightly sand the next day to remove bumps.  Apart from brushes, combs, squeegees, trowels, you can also use the following items to create a beautifully textured look:  Sponge: Blot the porous side of a sponge onto newly-applied joint compound and let the pores of the sponge create a wonderful texture.  Old rag: Blot the flat surface of an old rag against the joint compound for a similar, if less uniform, effect.  Tissue paper: Lay the tissue paper over the joint compound and depress into the compound using a clean, dry roller.  It should take several hours for the drywall joint compound to dry. Afterwards, hit the compound with one, perhaps two, coats of paint using a coarse roller.  ","lay drop cloths around the floor of the room. paint a 1/8 inch (0.3 cm) thick coat of drywall joint compound on to your walls. choose your retexturing instrument listed below. use other inventive surfaces to achieve an even but textured layer. allow the joint compound to dry before painting.

"This is the ultimate way to hurt your enemy! Especially if your enemy is smarter and more competitive than you. There are many ways that you can gain intelligence, but the one thing where we all get our intelligence from are books. Read as many books as you can. It can be science, mathematics, English, history, or even magazines and newspapers. All of these things will help you gain information. By being smart, you will totally fire up your enemy. Some of you may be too lazy, but all you've got to remember, is your enemies face when you beat them in exams and in life. Remember being smart will open you lot of doors in life. You will have a well-paid job and live a happy life with lots of friends. People will become interested in you and want to be your friend. Even the people that don't like you that much, will ask for your help. You will be respected and popular for your intelligence and that will burn up your enemy inside, although they may not seem to be on the outside. Eventually maybe they will realize what an idiot they were for leaving you and ask to be your friend again.;  , They will only be happier if you give up doing things that you used to do. Continue life as normal. This may be hard, but try your hardest to live life to the fullest. This will, of course, take time, but eventually like everything else in life, you will forget about them. Time goes by. . You can do it!  , Don't ever let people bring you down. Remember that if you don't respect yourself then others won't.  Even when you see them from time to time or everyday. Just pretend that they are not there. This will also get them angry! A simple way to do this by not looking their way. Even if they stare at you just pretend that they are not there. This may be hard but keep trying and eventually you will get there.  By being nice to others you will be liked and this will annoy your enemy. You can do this by helping someone. Only do this if the person or people you are being nice to respects your kindness. If they have mistreated you before then know the depth of your kindness. If what they have done is forgiven and forgotten then just be normal with them. Treat people like they treat you.  Do more activities and projects.  This is also another big way to get revenge back on you enemies. Once again it is not easy to be confident. But just remind yourself that you are human. No one else is better than you. You are the way you are and nothing can change that.Beat Your Enemy in everything in which you play against each other. Don't be too afraid of your enemy. Respect yourself for who you are. Remember that people don't judge you by the way you look they judge you by your character.  Change things that you did wrong. Don't think that just because people know you like this doesn't mean that you can't change. It is never too late to change. Try to improve on the bad habits that you have.  This will drive them insane! As it will be a negative reaction they will be looking for out of you, rather than a positive one.  Do to them exactly what they do to you, so they get a taste of their own medicine.  This will make them feel that they have to make more conversation and soon they will look like they are trying to get your attention and therefore will make you look more popular than them, thus giving you a bit of power over them.  ","be smart. don't give up on things. respect yourself. act as though they are not there. be nice. get involved in things. be confident. don't be afraid to change. as an alternative to step 4 you could always try acting like your enemy is your best friend. beat them at their own game. respond with one word answers when they talk or ask you questions.

"Shut the Box, also called Batten Down the Hatches, Canoga, High Rollers (the game show of the same name derives from it), Klackers, or Zoltan Box, is normally played with two to four players for money, although it can be played as a solitaire game.  When played for stakes, each player kicks a certain amount of money in the pot, which the winner will collect when the game is over.  The box in Shut the Box is labeled with tiles numbered from 1 to 9. At the beginning of the game, all the tiles are open.  Another form of box is the “Full House” box, which features tiles numbered from 1 to 12. A variation of this form of Shut the Box is “The 300,” which has a second box with tiles numbered from 13 to 24.  The game may also be played with some of the tiles already closed. In Even Stevens, only the even numbers are open, while the odd numbers are closed. In Against All Odds, only the odd numbers are open, while the even numbers are up. In 3 Down Extreme, the numbers 1, 2, and 3 are closed, while the rest are open. In Lucky Number 7, only the 7 tile is open and the box is passed around the players until one rolls a 7 to close it., This can be done by having the players roll one or both dice, with highest roll going first., Depending on the version being played, the player must roll both dice as long as the 7, 8, or 9 tiles remain open. Once those tiles are closed, the player may choose to roll one or both dice on each turn.  In some versions of the game, if a player rolls doubles, the player gets an extra turn.This option was used on the game show High Rollers, where an insurance marker was given to the player if he or she had a legal play with the value rolled.  In other versions of the game, a player must roll both dice until the sum of the values of the only tiles open is 6 or less (1, 2, 3; 1 and 5; 2 and 4; or 6). , Tiles whose face values add to the same values as the value rolled on the dice may be closed. If the value of the roll was 7, any of the following closures are legal:  Closing the 7 tile only.  Closing the 1 and 6 tiles, whether the individual die values are 1 and 6 or not.  Closing the 2 and 5 tiles, whether the individual die values are 2 and 5 or not.  Closing the 3 and 4 tiles, whether the individual die values are 3 and 4 or not.  Closing the 1, 2, and 4 tiles.  If the game is played “Thai style,” only one tile can be closed on each turn, either one of the two face values on their dice or their sum. If a value of 7 was rolled as a 3 – 4 combination, the player could shut the 3, the 4, or the 7 tile, but not any others, and not any combination that added to 7.  Other variations of the game require a certain tile to be closed on the first turn, or the player loses. In “2 To Go,” the 2 tile must be closed first; a first roll of 4 means an automatic loss. In “3 To Go,” the 3 tile must be closed first; a first roll of 2 means an automatic loss.  Once a player rolls a number that cannot legally close any of the tiles still open, that player’s turn is over. At this point, the player adds the values of the still open tiles to determine his or her score; if the 2 and 3 tiles are the ones still open, the player scores 5. (This is known as the Golf variation.)  In the Missionary variation of Shut the Box, a player’s score is the number of tiles still open. If the 2 and 3 tiles are the ones still open, the player scores 2 for two still-open tiles.  In the Digital or “say what you see” variation of the game, the player’s score is a number made using the digits still displayed after making a roll that can’t shut boxes. If the 2 and 3 tiles were still open, the player’s score would be 23 instead of 5.  The tiles are re-opened, and the next player tries to shut them by rolling the dice until no more tiles can be shut. This repeats until all players have had a chance to try to shut the box. The player with the lowest score wins the pot.  If any player succeeds in shutting all the tiles on the box, that player wins the game automatically and gets double the stake from the other players.The game can be played in rounds (Tournament style), using the Golf scoring variation, where each player’s score for a round is added to his previous score. Once a player reaches a total of 100 after a round is over, the player with the lowest score wins. It can also be played elimination style, where when a player reaches a total score of 45 or greater, that player is eliminated.  In the Unlucky Number 7 version of the game, if a player rolls a 7, the game ends.  ","gather the players. open all tiles on the box. determine who starts. have each player roll the dice, in turn. use the total of the dice to determine which tiles to close. continue rolling until no more tiles can be shut. pass the box and dice to the next player.

"Dampen a paper towel with a bit of cooking oil. Wipe the point of contact between the top and bottom bowls. Carefully pull or twist the stuck cooking bowls apart.You could use olive oil, vegetable oil, or any other cooking oil to unstick the cooking bowls.  If you don’t have any liquid cooking oil on hand, or if you’ve found that the oil is ineffective, you could use an oil-based spray. Just spray the point of contact between the two bowls with a light coating of cooking spray.Carefully pull or twist the cooking bowls apart.  Whether you’ve used an oil spray or liquid cooking oil, sometimes the oil won’t be effective immediately. If, after pulling or twisting the bowls apart, they are still stuck, wait about 20-30 seconds. This will give the oil time to work its way between the two cooking bowls that are stuck together.If necessary, apply or spray another coat of cooking oil to loosen them.  ","pour a bit of oil into the seal between the bowls. spray the point of contact between the two bowls. wait for the oil to trickle between the bowls. "
"Shop at American Eagle, Abercrombie, Aeropostale, Pink, Saks, Nordstrom and all the 'in' stores. If you can't really afford it, just shop in the clearance sections. Clothes can be up to 80% off in all the above stores. Also check out their outlets. Before shopping there, look for coupons for up to 25% off, because on top of the 25-90% off sales, sometimes you can add 25% off on top of that with your coupon. You can also shop at places such as Loehmann's, Marshalls, TJ Maxx and Ross if you look for big names such as BCBG, Ralph Lauren, Lilly Pulitzer, Tommy Bahama, Nine West, and Franco Sarto for super cheap prices every day. Plus, if you get a Maxxinista card, you get an additional discount and credit toward your next purchase.  Save up so you can afford designer clothing.;  , Shoes make the outfit. The cheaper the shoes, usually the less durable and comfortable. If you're in middle school or elementary, just shop for cute and comfy sneakers/canvas skimmers/Chinese slippers/ballet flats at cute yet cheap stores like Payless or Old Navy. If you have some more money, get shoes like Toms, Topsiders, Uggs, and Converse. If you're in high school or college, you'll just need a few pairs:  A pair of comfortable everyday shoes that aren't sneakers, loafers or moccasins. These can be a pair of metallic leather ballet flats, a pair of pretty purple low wedges, or a pair of pony hair leopard print pointy toe flats. Look into funky neutrals for the pattern, or color such as metallics, a color you don't wear a lot but adore, animal prints, polka dots, black snakeskin. Think of low wedges, ballet flats, 1 inch (2.5 cm) thin heels, and pointy toe flats. These should be comfortable enough to walk to school in, yet cute enough to wear with a flirty sundress.  If you pick a shoe that makes a big statement, limit it to the shoe. Don't pair a leopard print flat with a leopard print purse or worse - a skin tight shirt, or a metallic flat with a sparkly white eyeshadow or headband. Tacky much?  Black is great in simple leather, since it can be changed to look like a new pair of shoes with shoe jewelry.  A pair of comfortable everyday leather knee high boots. They should zip up and flatter the calves. The should be either flats or 1 inch (2.5 cm) thin heels or low wedges. They can be a nice neutral like black. Be wary of browns and tans because these colors can clash. Look at your skin color and hair color to assess what's perfect for you. Black works for most. But blondes that like to wear earthy browns and neutrals would carry of the earth natural hippie look well with camel colored boots. Make sure you can walk in snow and they are good for rain as well. You can look for very realistic faux leather lined with Thinsulate from good brands such as Enzo Angiolini and Nine west. Unlike the item above, it should not be a metallic/color/print/polka dot/special texture--that would make it less of a staple. It should be dressy enough to wear with a sweet little dainty dress in fall, but comfy too.  With this shoe use cheap jewelry from places like forever 21, or Claire's to sassy up outfits.  Why two? Trends change every year, but they always seem to ping pong from oversized to teeny tiny. You don't want to be a latecomer to each and every pendulum swing of the trend cycle. Pick leather because it is classic but always in the moment. Pick a color that flatters your skin tone. Don't pick up metallics, or special prints, but feel free to experiment with color. If you have a special color that you have on your everyday comfy shoe, wear it while purse shopping if you would like to have them match. Look at trends in purses; a major theme is dark colors like rouge, purple, and olive green.  Have two pairs of flattering dark colored (navy) jeans with a super skinny leg. Two t-shirts in colors that flatter you and a construction that skims your curves but doesn't squeeze them. Look into scoop necks and v-necks. If you live in cool climate, invest in a wool coat... Check out places such as Winners, Burlington Coat Factory, TJ Maxx,and Marshalls. Also buy 3 sweaters/jackets in either scoop, v-necks, or zip-down. One should be a basic black, two should be happy colors that make you smile. If you have a school uniform, get at least 5 shirts in bright and happy colors, black or navy skinny/curve-hugging bottoms, and 2 skirts in approved colors. If you can, own at least 1 feminine and pretty sundress.  This is the jacket that you put on over a pair of navy skinny jeans and a black sweater and it becomes an outfit. It becomes you. Think of your interests... Are you a hopeless romantic that gushes over silks and velvets in Victorian colors? Are you a rocker chick that's life anthem is 'Highway to Hell'? What jacket speaks to you? What do you put with your boring basics, and it becomes your closet staple? What brings out you in this mass produced world? Scour for it in every single unknown boutique. It's pieces like this that sets your closet apart from the pack. Get one in leather if you're rocker, cute and bubbly designs if you are girly, or plaid/stripes if you are preppy.  Girly girl, what about a necklace with a diamante heart pendant in pink? Like to make jewelry? Make something that makes you smile. Like sports? How about your favorite sports team's emblem on a pendant? Feel like a hippie? How about a hemp string or leather string with a wood pendant fashioned into a flower? If you are preppy, try some pearls. If you are the stereotypical popular girl, wear bangles. Always wear a pair of earrings. Own at least one dangle and one stud. Be creative, and most of all, have something that goes with everything and is totally you.  Go to websites such as style.com and look at designer collections. Look at ways that clothes are being worn. Are brooches being affixed to a certain part of the jacket or dress? It is not necessarily something you have to buy. Maybe you have a wool coat that hits at your mid thigh? Maybe wearing it with your knee high boots and a pair of translucent black tights with a pair of fishnets is what you can do, just like the model in the picture is being styled. Or wearing the wool coat just like that but with a bright maroon belt? Substitute shoes and colors and certain things for your own version. Always be up to date on styles for your grade. Currently, bright colors are in, so make sure to have plenty!  , Do you have something that you used to love, but now don't like it? Something that is too heavily patterned for your taste can be cut and turned into a scarf, which can be worn as a belt. Something that is too 'blah' can be given extra texture with wearing with more colorful clothes, or can use a ribbon a touch darker for a signature look. Go to a fabric store and scour the reduced section for extra things. An old pair of canvas skimmers in basic colors can be sassed up with a ribbon or shoe jewelry. If you have an old t-shirt that you have grown out of, but love a detail in it, cut it out and hem the edges... You can sew it onto a simple white or black tank/tee to add detail. (See How to Modify Your T Shirt.) You can buy tees and tanks real cheap by the bundle, so that 3 dollar tee/tank can look 30 dollars later. Adding contrast stitching by stitching a color obviously darker or lighter on clothing to create a unique look is the cheapest way to rejuvenate a pair of 3 yr old jeans or tees.  Get highlights if you can. Get your hair cut in long and pretty layers. Keep it straight most of the time, yet curl it every two weeks. Keep your hair soft and shiny. Wash it every other day with a good quality shampoo and conditioner. Brush it every morning and night. Style it in pretty styles like waves, straight, half-up, braid, french braid, side ponytail, high ponytail, etc. If you really want to come back with a bang, get side bangs!  , Make sure it is super clean, clear, and soft.

Get into a sexy sport, like dance, cheerleading, volleyball, or any other mainly feminine sport.  Just because you look super hot doesn't mean you are super hot. You need to be outgoing, flirtatious, and adorable. Everybody should love you, even if you weren't popular the previous year. If you had a bad rap the previous year, you can clean it up this year by associating yourself with the right people. Try to be the best you can be.  They may not seem like much, but really they can make a difference. Get a supply list. Get your number 2 pencils in cute colors like pink or blue.

"Creating and sticking to a budget will help you to not only cut expenses and reduce debt, but it will also help you to save and build your wealth. The process of building a budget forces you to categorize your expenses into needs and wants, so you learn where you can cut expenses. Also, it helps you to evaluate what you can actually afford giving your current income and expenses. If you know exactly how much you have to spend each month and prioritize your expenses, you will be far less likely to overdraw your account. Also, you can avoid having to pay bills with credit cards, which only increases your debt., This can be more challenging for some people than for others. If you are paid a salary on a weekly, bi-weekly, semi-monthly or monthly basis, it is easy to figure out how much you earn in a month. However, if you are paid hourly or your salary varies seasonally, it can be more challenging to determine your average monthly income.Those on a fixed salary can determine how many times they get paid per month and multiply that number by their net paycheck amount to determine their total monthly income. For example, if you get a bi-weekly paycheck, then you receive two paychecks per month. If your net paycheck after taxes is $1,250, then your total monthly income would be $2,500 ($1,250 x 2 = $2,500).  If you are paid bi-weekly, this means you receive 26 paychecks per year, or two extra, because two months of the year have will have three paydays. Be aware which months include this additional payday.  If you are paid semi-monthly, you will receive two paychecks per month, regardless of the length of the month, resulting in 24 paychecks per year.  If you get paid hourly or your income is irregular for any reason, then look at the last six to 12 months of paychecks.  Figure out the average you earn per month. For example, suppose over the past six months you earned $2,500, $3,000, $2,000. $1,800, $3,200, and $2,700. Add these amounts together to get the total ($15,200). Divide the total by 6 to get the average monthly salary ($15,200 / 6 = $2,533 per month).  Determine your monthly recurring debt payments. Include car loans, student loans, credit card payments and mortgages. For credit card payments, find out your minimum monthly payment. If you have stopped incurring new debt, then these monthly payment amounts are not likely to change in the short-term and you can use them as expense line items in your budget. However, if you haven’t broken your dependence on credit cards, then creating this budget will help you plan to get out of long-term debt., Figure out how much you pay each month for other expenses besides debt. These expenses include household expenses, such as utilities and groceries. Transportation, clothing, cell phone and cable bills may be other expenses you have. Categorize your expenses in as much detail as needed so your budget makes sense for you. For example, some people may be comfortable with one line item for utilities, while others might prefer to break this down into electric, gas and water.If you are not sure how much you spend each month on some of these items, then track your expenses for a few weeks.  Subtract your total debt payments and other monthly expenses from your total monthly income. If you have a positive balance at the end of the month, then that means you are spending within your means. You have an opportunity to invest some of your extra income and build your wealth. If you have a negative balance, then that means you are overspending. You need to evaluate your expenses and find ways to stop spending more than you earn., If you are overspending, then you need to look at your expenses and see what you can cut. This is where having gone through the exercise of categorizing your expenses will help you. It will help you to not only separate needs from wants, but also to see where most of your money is going.You may not be able to make adjustments on some of your line items. Some expenses, such as your rent or mortgage, may be fixed and cannot change in the short-term.  However, chances are that you will be able to find many other areas where you can reduce your spending. For example, many people begin by looking at how much they’re spending on food and plan to eat out fewer times per month.  Plan to pay down debt. If you can reduce your expenses for groceries, cable, cell phones and clothing enough, you can divert some of those funds towards paying down your credit card debts.  Plan to save as much as possible. Also, you should definitely plan to save up a rainy day fund of at least a few thousand dollars. Having this money put aside will allow you to pay for unexpected expenses as they come up without having to use your credit cards and incur more debt.  Put aside at least one hour per week to review your budget. Now that you have made the effort to create a budget, invest time each week to look at your spending and make sure you are staying on track. If you become disciplined about monitoring and sticking to your budget, it will help you to avoid overspending each month. Not only will it help you stop living from paycheck to paycheck, but it will also help you to save some money and do some long-term financial planning.  ","understand why making a budget is important. calculate your monthly income. find out your total debt. determine your recurring monthly expenses. evaluate the bottom line. plan necessary adjustments to spending. track your spending.

"If worrying is interfering with your day-to-day life and you can't stop, try putting off your worries until later. Give yourself permission to worry, but only during certain times of the day.For example, you might set aside a half an hour after dinner each day for worrying. If a worry pops into your head at any other time, you can recognize it, but just tell yourself 'I'll think about that later.'This technique lets you set your worries aside for awhile so you can get through your day.;  , A study from the University of Chicago shows that writing your worries down can help you let go of them.Writing your worries down can help make the problem feel more manageable.  This strategy works well with postponing your worries. Making note of them on the list can help you feel like you can let your worries go until 'worry time.' Then, when it is worry time, you can just go over your list., Talking through your worries can also help. It can put things in perspective and help you get to the root of your issues.Be aware though that too much of this can be hard for your friends. If this is an ongoing issue, consider seeing a counselor or other mental health professional.  Recent studies have shown that people who rely on computers and other devices for social interaction suffer from more anxiety.Consider cutting down on your screen time to help with excess worrying.Social media use in particular may lead to conflict, and comparison of yourself with others. It can also make it harder to relax. All this can promote worry.Switching off your devices several times a day can give you more control over your relationship with technology., Doing something with your hands, such as knitting or using 'worry beads' may help reduce stress and worry.Recent studies by the Medical Research Council show that keeping your hands busy during troubling events may reduce how much they bother you later.The research has not discovered any impact on worries about things that have already happened. But, if you are in a troubling situation, do something patterned and repetitive with your hands. It might reduce worries about it later., Exercising is not just good for your body. It is also an effective way to decrease the anxiety that leads to worry.Regular exercise may be more effective than prescription drugs for decreasing your anxiety levels.  Research on animals shows that exercise increases levels of serotonin. This is a brain chemical that relieves anxiety and makes you feel happier., Taking slow deep breaths activates the vagus nerve, which can help reduce stress and worry.Some people recommend taking '4-7-8' breaths when worried. To do this, exhale completely through your mouth. Then, inhale through your nose, counting to four as you do so. Hold your breath for seven seconds. Finally, exhale through your mouth, counting to eight as you do so., Medical research shows that meditating affects the brain in ways that decrease worrying. If you are a persistent worrier learning how to meditate may be very helpful.  Meditation increases activity in the Ventromedial prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain that controls worrying.It also grounds you in the present moment. Meditation, done right, should make it impossible to think about future problems, at least while you are meditating.  Recent medical studies support the claim that the scents of certain essential oils can reduce stress and worry. In particular, the smell of grapefruit was shown to be effective in this area.Essential oils and other aromatherapy products are available in many health stores and natural food shops. You can also try just smelling a grapefruit!  , Sometimes, trying to suppress your worries seems to just make them worse. So, don't try to ignore your worries. When they pop into your head, accept them, but then try to move on.It is hard to avoid thinking about something you are actively trying not to think about.Writing your worries down or setting a designated 'worry time' can be very helpful in letting them pass., When you do think about your worries, a good way to process them is to categorize them. Specifically, for each try to determine the following:  Is this problem one you can solve, or not? If a worry is about a problem you have the power to fix, the best remedy may be to start fixing it. Once you have a plan to fix the problem, you will be less worried. If you cannot solve the problem, accept it, work through it and move on. Is this worry about something that is likely, or unlikely, to happen? A worry about something that is likely to happen may indeed be troubling. On the other hand, if you decide it is not likely to occur, this can be a first step in letting that worry go.Is this worry about something about something really bad, or not? Think about what it is that you are worried might happen. If it did occur, how bad would it really be? Most things we worry about aren't actually that terrible. If you decide it wouldn't be a catastrophe, this can help you let go. That's doubly true if it also isn't that likely to happen!Throughout this process, try to think rationally. Ask yourself what evidence you have that your worry is a realistic one. Think about what you might tell a friend who had the same worry. Try to imagine the most likely outcome, rather than the worst-case scenario., If there is a specific worry that bothers you often, you can try to make it boring, so your brain will return to it less often. Do this by repeating it in your head again and again for several minutes.For example, if you worry that you might get in a car accident, repeat in your head the words 'I might get in a car accident, I might get in a car accident.' In the short term, this may increase you anxiety. But, after a little while, the words will lose their power and become boring to you. Chances are, they'll stop popping up in your mind so often after that.  An important change in your thinking is accepting that life is unpredictable and imperfect. This is key to stopping worries in the long term. A good place to start this change is with a writing exercise. Jot down your answers to these questions:Is it possible to be certain about everything that might happen?  In what way is needing certainty helpful to you?  Do you tend to predict bad things will happen just because you are uncertain? Is that reasonable?  Can you live with the possibility that a bad thing might happen, if that outcome is not likely?  When worries come to mind, try to remind yourself of your answers to these questions.  Emotions can be contagious. If you spend a lot of time with other worriers, or people who make you anxious, you may want to reconsider how much time you are spending with those people.Spend some time thinking about the people you spend time with, and how they affect you. It may even be helpful to keep a 'worry diary' that tracks when you worry most. If you find that it's right after seeing a certain person, you may decided you need to spend less time with him or her. Or, you might decide there are certain topics you don't wish to discuss with this person any more.  Changing your social circle can change the way you think.  Most worries rise from fears about the future, rather than our immediate surroundings. Focusing on you surroundings and the moment you are experiencing can be a good way to shut down worries.Some people recommend a 'stop, look, listen' technique. In this approach, when you are worrying, stop and recognize the worry. Take a deep breath. Then, look at your surroundings. Spend five minutes focusing on the details of the world around you. As you do so, speak calmly and reassure yourself that things will work out.  ","postpone worrying. write your worries down. talk about your worries. spend less time on the computer. keep your hands busy. get plenty of exercise. take deep breaths. try meditation. try aromatherapy. recognize your worries and move on. categorize and challenge your worries. make your worries boring. accept uncertainty and imperfection. think about social influences. live in the moment.

"Just because your friend is a lesbian and you are female, don't assume that there is a romantic interest. Not everyone is going to be attracted to you, or vice versa. It's the same between men and women as it is between women and women. It's about romantic chemistry.  Avoid prejudice or biases towards your lesbian friend based on misconceptions.;  , As with anyone who feels 'butterflies in their stomach,' your lesbian friend may give off signs that she is interested. Notice if the following signs are strong before assuming that your friend is into you:Physically touching you by hand or leg.  Having strong eye contact, or gazing at you often.  Smiling, laughing, and appearing to hang on your every word.  Possibly being more physically shy or awkward than usual.  While some friends may have a close bond simply due to friendship, there are some signs that your friend may be attracted to you. Think of it like when you hang out with guys that you think might want to be more than 'just friends.'Does your friend seem to give pointed compliments to you often? Something like, 'You're so beautiful' or 'You have gorgeous eyes.'  Does she make a big effort to spend a lot time with you, even in group or large party situations?  Do you feel like you communicate more with her than your other friends? Do you text or chat with her back and forth in the same way you do with guys you're interested in?  , You may like the attention you get from your lesbian friend, but at the same time you know you're not interested. Just like with guy friends, don't play head games and lead her on. If someone is attracted to you and you're not, be mature, polite, and respectful.Honesty in the beginning will help to avoid heartaches and drama in the future.  Unless your lesbian friend has already asked you out on a date, you may not know for sure what's going on her head. Talk with your friend to understand what her feelings are, and if it's true that she's into you.  If you have already engaged in sexual contact (such as kissing) or already gone on what you both know is a date, then your relationship has already gone outside 'the friend zone.'  Be as kind and caring as you have been in the past with anyone you've dated.  Avoid discussing your relationship with your friend in public or in a group with other friends. This conversation should be between you and your friend only.  If you are planning to reject your friend's advances, avoid any embarrassment that may occur by talking in private.  While you may be inclined to text or message your feelings about the situation, this may make things confusing or lead to misconceptions.  Talk with your friend in person or at least over the phone. Direct private communication may be tough, but it will be better for both you and your friend.  When rejecting your friend, make clear that you are not rejecting your friend as a person. Be kind and gentle. Be clear that you simply are not interested in a relationship with her, and that you are not bisexual or lesbian.Be respectful of your friend's sexual orientation.  Consider saying, 'I respect your orientation, but I'm just not into you. I'm straight' or 'You're a great friend, and hope to keep it that way, but I'm straight and just don't feel the same way.'  , After rejecting someone (or being rejected), it can feel very awkward. Be mature and keep your head up. You may have rejected someone in the past, or been rejected. There is a transition phase that may feel weird, but you and your friend will move on and get over this feeling.Keep doing the things that you usually do, and avoid making this a big deal.  All friendships can go through ups and down. If you want to still be friends with your lesbian friend, make sure she still feels included in activities that you and your other friends are doing. Avoid excluding her due to this awkward feeling.  True friendships will remain even after difficult times.  Make clear to your lesbian friend about what makes her such a great friend. Avoid compliments that have sexual connotations, but instead focus on her strengths as a friend. A good friend is caring, reliable, honest, and trustworthy.  Being gay or straight is part of human biology. Your lesbian friend did not 'choose to be gay.' A person's sexual feelings, whether gay or straight, are formed at or before puberty. Be respectful of your friend's sexual orientation.Talk with your friend about what challenges your friend may be facing with being a lesbian since society is often centered around heterosexual relationships. Understand her perspective.  It might be harder for your lesbian friend to talk about her sexuality because it is less accepted in many cultures. Be respectful that coming out and talking about sexuality can be very difficult for some people.Be gentle in how you react to your friend's actions or what she says about being lesbian. Avoid being overly critical.  Whether you have a lot of friends who are gay or not, being a real friend involves acceptance. While unwanted sexual contact shouldn't be taken lightly, feelings of awkwardness about someone's sexuality or your own biases should be avoided.  Your friend has a right to be who she is, and so do you.  Allow your friends regardless of their sexual orientation the opportunity to express love. You may not reciprocate those feelings, but nonetheless they have a right to feel them.  ","avoid assumptions. look for body language. listen to what your friend says and how she acts. avoid leading someone on. consider asking about her feelings toward you, if any. talk with your friend in private. turn her down gently. avoid awkwardness. keep your friendship strong. view homosexuality as part of biology rather than a lifestyle choice. understand that coming out as gay can be difficult. accept your friends for who they are.

"Take your dog for a long walk or let it run around at a dog park before being around elderly people. You can also play fetch or another game where the dog runs around a lot to tire it out. Most of the danger of having an active dog around elderly people is that the dog might knock them down or injure them just out of excitement. In order to curb this risk, you should make sure to really tire the dog out before the meeting.If the dog is tired out, it is less likely to be really wild and uncontrollable. However, there are some dogs that will be really active when meeting new people or old friends no matter how much exercise you give them. Make this judgement for yourself based on your particular dog.;  , In order to keep an elderly person really safe around an active dog, you need to control that dog's behavior. Extensive training that the dog consistently responds to is the best way to control its behavior. Training requires daily practice with your dog, clear and consistent directions, and positive reinforcement to encourage your dog to follow your commands.  With a well-trained dog, you can allow the dog to be around an elderly person unrestrained because you know that it will stop dangerous behavior immediately if commanded.  Training that is very successful will allow you to control your dog's behavior no matter what it is doing with a simple command.  This type of training takes a long time to complete. Don't expect to get total control over your dog's actions in a week or two. It takes lots and lots of repetition and positive reinforcement to instill in your dog.  If you are planning on introducing your dog to a family member then you can let the dog smell his or her smells ahead of time. Getting a piece of clothing or a sheet or blanket that the person uses and letting your dog smell it ahead of time will let the dog get the excitement of new smells over with.  If the dog has already smelled someone, then doing this before he or she comes over will not generally diffuse the dog's excitement. This tactic is usually just helpful for first time encounters.  This technique is used often when introducing dogs to new babies, but can work with other types of situations as well.  ","tire the dog out. do extensive training. allow the dog to smell the person ahead of time. "
"Or, you could ask a friend to make the designs for you. You'll have to give your friend some of the money you made, though.

"Get a thorough understanding of the most important information in your speech by writing your speech in outline form before writing out in its full, complete form. An outline will touch on all the major parts of your speech, thereby making it easier for you to divide your speech into manageable parts later on.  Your outline should include all major ideas and all major supporting ideas. If you have any special examples or analogies you want to use withing your speech, this also warrants a bullet point.;  , To cement the speech in your head, you need to write it out in its complete form. This includes the introduction, body, and conclusion of the speech.  You should write out the entire speech even if you do not plan on memorizing it verbatim.  Before using any memorization techniques, you need to speak and hear the speech so that more of your senses are engaged in the memorization practice.  If at all possible, try to read the speech in the place you will deliver it. The acoustics of every room and setting vary somewhat, so reading your speech in the actual delivery location can help you get accustomed to the way your voice will sound from that spot. Additionally, it helps you get comfortable with the layout of the room, making it possible for you to rehearse your movements as well as your words.  Most of your speech will not need to be memorized word-for-word. As a rule of thumb, though, you should at least consider memorizing your introduction and conclusion word-for-word, or as close to it as possible, while aiming to memorize the key ideas and details of your body without memorizing the body material exactly.  Memorizing the introduction can be a good idea because knowing precisely what to say at the beginning of a speech can help calm you down and ease you into the setting. Memorizing the conclusion is also helpful because it prevents you from accidentally falling into a concluding loop, in which you continually repeat information as you try to close.  Memorizing the full body of the speech verbatim is generally not recommended, however, because a memorized speech can sound stiff and unnatural.  Regardless of which memorization tactics you use and how effective they are, the most valuable thing you can do for yourself is to practice the speech as often as possible. It's even better if you practice the speech out loud, rather than only trying to recall it in your mind.  For the first couple of practices, you can practice by reading the speech from your notebook or note cards. After the first two to four practices, though, you should start practicing your speech from memory as best as possible. You can refer to your notes when you get stuck, but deliver as much as possible without your notes.  Try to practice your speech from memory for at least half of your practices, if not more.  Each main idea or major supporting detail should be granted its own part. In other words, if the information was written as a bullet point in your outline, it gets its own part.  If you did not write an outline or do not like the way your information is organized into bullet points on the outline, you could opt to divide your speech by paragraph instead of by bullet point. The idea is mostly to assign one major idea to each part.  Create a mental image for each part. The more absurd and unique the image is, the easier it will be to recall it later.  For instance, if your speech is about various healthy and beauty uses for organic food products, and a part of your speech mentions that coconut oil can help hair grow faster, you could imagine something like Rapunzel sitting on top of a tower made of coconuts or living in a room filled with coconuts. Rapunzel emphasizes the idea of long hair, while the coconuts help point out the connection to coconut oil. The elements are normal enough but absurd when combined, making it easier to recall them.  In your speech, you need to weave the mental images together. The easiest way to do this is to visualize yourself traveling along various locations, observing the pictures in order.  The location can be near or far; the choice is up to you. Ultimately, though, you should be able to navigate it well enough in your mind to find your way to your various visuals.  You could choose something as simple as a forest if many of your visualizations seem to belong outside.  Alternatively, you could also use the human body as a map. The images can be “tattooed” onto the body in your mind, and as you travel along the body, you will hit the images in order more naturally.  With the locations and visualizations set, you need to begin practicing your speech by relying on these visuals for guidance. As you practice, actually imagine yourself traveling from location to location, viewing each image in the order that its corresponding bullet point falls within your speech.  You need to have firm links connecting one visualization to the next. If not, you might forget the order your information is supposed to land in.  In the example with Rapunzel and the coconuts, you could connect that visual to the one before it by ending with the imagined you having your hair ruined, leading the imagined you to seek advice from someone with long, strong hair.  For small speeches or sections of a speech you want to memorize word-for-word, use the chunking method. Divide the speech into short, manageable chunks that are between two and three sentences long.Take the time to actually mark off each section or chunk of information in your written notes. This can make it easier for you to recall when one part ended and when the next part picks up as you practice, making it harder for you to accidentally forget or leave any parts out.  Practice reciting the first chunk of information out loud, repeating it until you can recall it completely without referring to your notes.  If you get stuck, do not immediately return to your notes. Start from the beginning and try to say the chunk again. If this fails, spend a few more moments trying to recall the missing information. When you decide that nothing can help you remember it, return to your notes and briefly look up what the missing part consisted of.  When you finish memorizing a chunk of your speech, read through it again to verify that you have it correct.  Once you finish recalling the first chunk successfully, add the second chunk to it, repeating both until the second chunk can be recited from memory, as well. Continue on in this manner until the entire speech or speech section can be recalled without the use of notes.  It is important that you continue repeating previously memorize chunks so that you do not forget them. Moreover, repeating all chunks of your speech together will help you to memorize how each chunk fits together with the rest.  Continue practicing your speech out loud. If you have trouble remembering a certain chunk, isolate it and focus on recalling it from memory before trying to weave it back into the speech as a whole.  While writing and speaking your speech are the two most important practices involved in memorizing the speech, recording the speech and playing it back for yourself can also help.  Use this recording to listen to your speech when you do not have the chance to practice it out loud. You can play it for yourself in the car or play it as you fall asleep, for example.  Mental images are often the strongest sense to rely on for memory, but these other senses can still help significantly.  For instance, if you say that a certain historical event really made a bang or made a splash, you can imagine the sound of a loud bang or the sound and feeling of something heavy dropping into water.  If you have a list that you need to recall verbatim, you can use a mnemonic device known as an acronym to recall the items on that list. An acronym uses the first letter of each item in the list to create a sentence or word, which can then be used to recall those first letters.  For example, you can use the acronym HOMES to recall the names of the Great Lakes in the U.S.: Huron, Ontario, Michigan, Erie, Superior  , Consider weaving analogies and stories into your speech to illustrate various concepts and ideas. A concrete example can make information easier to recall, and concrete examples can also engage the audience better.  For example, if you deliver a speech about various mental disorders and you know someone in your family or from your past who suffers from a disorder covered in your speech, you can tell a story about that person that illustrates what it is like to suffer from that disorder.  By incorporating physical actions into your speech delivery, you can help yourself memorize important parts of your speech while also engaging your audience more effectively.  If speaking about a political issue in the United States, you could raise your left hand when talking about what the political left believes and your right hand when talking about what the political right believes.

"Healthy guinea pigs are very active during the day and evening. They love to play and need frequent exercise.Heatstroke, however, can make a guinea pig feel very weak. If your guinea pig has heatstroke, his legs will become weak. He will be unable or unwilling to move.If your guinea pig is able to walk, he may stagger around. In addition, his muscles may start to tremor.With heatstroke, your guinea will stop playing and running around.;  , When healthy, your guinea pig will quietly breathe about 80 times a minute.This sounds fast, but it is normal. If he has heatstroke, you will see him panting and struggling to breathe.His panting will get faster as his heatstroke worsens.He may start breathing very heavily—you may see his whole body move as he tries to breathe., Heatstroke can cause guinea pigs to drool, which is not normal guinea pig behavior. Also, his saliva may look thick or feel sticky, rather than feel fairly thin. If your guinea pig will let you, look in his mouth—his tongue will be bright red.His tongue should be pink.  His gums, which should also be pink, may look very pale or red., Normally, if you touch your guinea pig, you will feel his natural body heat. However, if he’s suffering from heatstroke, he may actually feel hot to the touch. Gently touch your guinea pig to see how warm he is. His ears, in particular, will feel very hot.An increased heart rate is common in guinea pigs with heatstroke.Be aware, though, that the heart of a healthy guinea pig beats over 200 times a minute.You can try to touch his chest to feel his heart beat, but it will probably be hard to tell that it’s beating faster than usual.  Heatstroke can make your guinea pig physically ill. He may start vomiting or have diarrhea.As long as he is healthy and eating a normal diet, he should not vomit or have diarrhea.  Normal feces look like soft, dark pellets. If your guinea pig has diarrhea, his feces may be watery and less formed.  Guinea pigs, despite being very active, are usually not restless. On a normal day, your guinea pig will keep himself busy by moving from one activity to another, enjoying each activity. If he has heatstroke, though, he may be restless and agitated.It will look like he just can’t make up his mind with what he wants to do.  Heatstroke can cause seizures in guinea pigs. During a seizure, your guinea pig would fall to one side and experience muscle spasms and fast eye twitching.The eye twitching may last for several minutes. You may hear your guinea pig squeal or screech during the seizure.Seizures are not very common in guinea pigs., With handling and quality time together, your guinea pig will recognize your voice and respond to you. If he has severe heatstroke, though, he may fall into a coma, lose consciousness, and not respond to you.Try touching him and speaking to him. Even if he is weak and feeling really sick, he may still be alert enough to respond to you.  When your guinea pig is suffering from heat stroke, act quickly! The sooner you help him, the better his chances of recovering. Move him out of the heat and take him inside to a cool area. Call your vet right away to let them know your guinea pig needs immediate help.The shade can get hot, so do not simply move your guinea pig to a shaded area outside.  Before going to your vet’s office, start cooling down your guinea pig at home. Fill a bowl or sink with about 4 cm of lukewarm water and gently place your guinea pig in the water. Scoop some water up in your hands and gently get him wet. Do not use cold water—the cold water would lower his body temperature too quickly and cause him to go into shock.Along with his fur and feet, make sure you get his ears wet.If your guinea pig cannot stand on his own, gently hold him upright in the water.  Rather than put your guinea pig in water, you could spray his fur with tepid water, then fan him., When your guinea pig’s body doesn’t feel so hot to the touch, place him on a clean, damp towel and take him to your vet. Turn on the car’s air conditioning to keep him cool. Rolling down the windows is also an option, but may let a lot of hot air into the car. Once you get to your vet’s office, your vet will take immediate action to cool your guinea pig. They will:Hydrate him  Give him extra oxygen  Give him medication, if needed  Monitor him for other conditions, like kidney failure, shock, and heart problems  ","determine how well your guinea pig can move. watch your guinea pig’s breathing. look at your guinea pig’s mouth. touch your guinea pig. look for signs of digestive upset. look for agitation or restlessness. observe seizure activity. determine if your guinea pig is responding to you. move your guinea pig to a cool area. place your guinea pig in lukewarm water. take your guinea pig to your vet.

"After the summer weather has faded into fall, and the nights have gotten colder, it's time to plant your bulbs and start dreaming of spring again. You want to plant the bulbs before the first deep frost, which hardens the grounds and makes it much more difficult to dig holes for the bulbs. The bulbs should be planted when the soil is still at least 60 °F (16 °C).Plan to plant the bulbs within a week after buying them. They shouldn't stay above the ground for too long.Don't plant the bulbs too early, or they might come up before the weather gets cold and die as soon as the frosts come. They should lie dormant in the ground all winter and come up in the spring.;  , You can get them from a nursery, a home and garden store, or buy them online. Tulips are hardy flowers that will grow in most climates. Depending on what variety you buy, each bulb will produce one 1-4 stems and blossoms.  Choose bulbs that are firm to the touch with a light brown papery skin, almost like an onion skin.  Do not plant a bulb that is soft or shriveled, as it may be rotten or dead inside.  Many people plant tulips along fences, walkways, or buildings to add little bursts of color. They're often planted in rows, since it's easy to control where they come up. Figure out where you want to plant your tulips as you get ready to plant them.  Tulips grow best in areas that are sunny or lightly shaded, and not excessively wet.  Tulips come in many colors, so it's easy to plant them in interesting patterns and shapes. You could alternate colors or plant a whole bed of multicolored tulips, for example. Design a tulip pattern that makes sense for your yard.  Tulips grow in most soils, and there's not much you need to do to get it ready for planting. However, if the soil where you live is very dry or hard, you can wait to plant the tulips until a day after it has rained. Remove any weeds or stones and use a trowel to loosen and aerate the soil.  Space the holes 4 to 6 inches (10.2 to 15.2 cm) apart, and dig them about 8 inches (20.3 cm) from the base of the bulb. So if you have a 1-inch bulb, you'll need a 9-inch hole. The larger the bulb, the deeper the hole must be.  As you dig, clear away roots, rocks and other debris that could impede the growth of your tulips.  You can sprinkle kitty litter, gravel, holly leaves, or thorny bush branches into the hole to deter mice and other rodents from occupying the hole., Place them in the holes pointy-side up (otherwise they'll try to sprout downward). Sprinkle the soil back into the holes and pack it down with your hands, taking care not to tilt the bulbs in another direction.  Tulip bulbs are naturally perennials, meaning they can come back more than once. In most climates, though, the soil isn't conducive to more than one year of growth, and the bulb only contains enough nutrients for it to bloom once. If you want the tulips to come back after the first year, place some plant food in the holes before closing them back up.  Right after planting, give the bulbs some water. This helps them begin the process of growing. Don't give them a soaking, though; bulbs will decay and die if they get too wet.  Don't water the bulbs again unless it's extremely dry outside. Unless the ground is very dry, there is no need to water the bulbs. Newly planted bulbs may rot if the soil becomes sodden and waterlogged. There should be enough rain through the autumn and winter to provide your bulbs with enough moisture.  By March or April in the northern hemisphere and September or October in the southern hemisphere, your bulbs should have transformed into beautiful spring tulips.  ","prepare to plant the bulbs in the fall. choose tulip bulbs to plant. decide where to plant the bulbs. assess the planting site. dig holes for the bulbs. plant the tulip bulbs. water the bulbs lightly. watch for the tulips to sprout in the spring.

"If you're older, you may not be able to stay awake for late nights or get up very early in the morning. Choose travel times that work for your energy level to assure a safe trip.Mid-morning or afternoon departure times may work best if you're a senior. If you're driving yourself, plan to drive around this time of day. If you're taking a plane, bus, train, or other mode of transportation, look for departure times around this timeframe.;  , As a senior, you may want to limit how often you move around while traveling. One way to do this is to look for non-stop flights. Layovers can cause extra strain from moving your bags and getting on and off an airplane multiple times.If you have to have a layover, minimize the amount of layovers and look for shorter layovers when possible.  Some airlines and other transportation options, like busses, may offer senior discounts. If you can get a senior discount for travel, this can save you a lot of money. While booking tickets, always check to see if an airline or other company offers senior discounts.Some senior discounts are misleading and do not save you as much money as they advertise. You can use websites like FareCompare to evaluate which discounts truly save you money.  Traveler's insurance may be more worth it as you age. You may be more prone to certain injuries and accidents, so always opt for the traveler's insurance offered by airlines and hotels.Traveler's insurance can cover medical costs if you have an accident while traveling. For example, it can cover your medications if you go to a hospital out of state.  Traveler's insurance is particularly important if you're on a lot of medications. Many insurance policies cover the cost of medications in the event they get lost when you travel.  If you have any age-related disabilities, make sure you get them taken care of while traveling. You may need special accommodations for things like planes and hotels on your trip.If you're taking a plane, check with the airline about how to alert people to your disabilities. Some airlines allow you to alert people of your disabilities online while booking your trips. Others require you to call the airport.

"While you may find roleplaying guilds on PvP or PvE servers, they will be fewer and farther between. Furthermore, the overall culture of a roleplaying server, as well as certain rules specific to each server type, will have an effect on your ability to immerse yourself in your adventures. A list of WoW’s servers, along with their locations, types, and popularity, can be found at battle.net on the Realm Status page.  Consider when your primetime for playing will be, and choose a server accordingly. You’ll want to choose a server where the bulk of the population will be on and playing at the same time you are, for the most enjoyable experience., While cross-realm grouping has eliminated many of the issues associated with low population servers, a busier realm will have more guilds and more opportunities for adventuring with others. Low population servers can be great for farming rare mobs, but the cons (difficulties in downing world bosses, finding a guild that suits your style, etc.) tend to outweigh these., Once you’ve chosen your realm, just select it from the server list upon entering the game, and prior to creating your character., When roleplaying, creating the role itself is one of the more enjoyable aspects. However, before you jump to the character creation U/I, it’s important to understand just what a blood elf is and certain aspects of their culture—Class, Gender, Name, and Appearance. The first aspect, Class, will affect your gameplay experience and influence, to some extent, the appearance of your character. However, it will also play an important part in determining your character’s backstory and influence their future adventures. Here’s a breakdown:  Death Knight. When Arthas invaded the elven city of Quel’Thalas, he raised the fallen as death knights—undead warriors whom he planned to command as his own minions. Playable death knights, however, have escaped his control. You have not, however, escaped the unalterable fact that you must inflict suffering upon others or end up in agony yourself, so expect to spend a lot of time seeking adventures where doing so suits you. One thing (other than being undead, of course) sets DKs apart from other blood elves: they are no longer addicted to arcane magic.  Mage. If you’re looking to live a high profile life in Silvermoon City or another blood-elf dense enclave, being a mage is the obvious path for the ambitious. Mages are the most socially revered blood elves in a general sense, and the highest ranging mages constitute a large portion of the ruling class. It’s a natural reflection on the society’s addiction to and proclivity for all things arcane.  Paladin. Most blood elf paladins are associated with a faction known as Blood Knights. Unlike other paladins, Blood Knights draw their power from the Sunwell, the source of arcane magic upon which all blood elves are dependent. This means your character is much less obligated to be an ethical beacon, as it were.  Monk. Blood elves have a rather short history when it comes to the martial arts styles favored by Pandaren. If you become a blood elf monk, you will be part of one of the first generations to embrace this novel path.  Hunter. Hunters, often referred to as rangers in blood elf society, are renowned for their agility and prowess, even by other races. The existence of the Farstrider faction, composed of rangers, has helped to further their good reputation—Farstriders seek to destroy evil whether they find it. They have a contentious relationship with Blood Knights, due to their differing views.  Priest. A blood elf priest may be a practicing member of the Church of Holy Light, but as with paladins, their ability to draw power from the Sunwell negates the obligation of devotion.  Rogue. Rogues have a wide variety of roleplay choices. They may associate with the more benevolent worldview of the Farstriders, and simply consider themselves gifted melee fighters. They may also find work as couriers, spies, or assassins if they are so inclined.  Warlock. Because blood elves are already magic-addicted and, some would say, tainted by fel magic, this career path is not as shunned amongst blood elves as it is among many other races. There is little, however, lore on the topic of blood elf warlocks. Given the high status accorded to mages, however, these demon-oriented magic users are a good fit for a blood elf roleplay that seeks to focus on the darker sides of their nature.  Warrior. Blood elf warriors are ferocious melee fighters who rely upon their agility and grace to wield swords, axes, maces, and shields. Unlike death knights and paladins, their skills are primarily physical rather than magical in nature.  While gender has no effect on gameplay mechanics, it is useful to note that certain aspects of blood elf society are more skewed toward males or females. For example, there are notably more male mages in power than female, though some have risen in the ranks. On the other hand, some of the most legendary rangers are blood elf women., Blood elf first names vary quite a bit, with many having names with a bit of a Roman influence, while others have something of a Celtic feel. Almost all blood elf names flow appealingly. One good way to get a good handle on appropriate first names is to take a look at lists of blood elf NPCs online. Surnames are almost always a combination of two standard words: Sunsworn, Dawnblade, Brightstar, etc., Appearance is important to blood elves, so take this into account when deciding what your character will look like. Most blood elves are pale with light colored hair, however, their consumption of fel magic can darken their complexion. Other hair colors are available as well, and some blood elves also dye their hair to further distinguish themselves from their high elf relatives., In just the past few decades, elven society has seen incredible upheaval, devastation, and experienced what many consider unforgivable betrayal by their allies and even their own leaders. Reading up on blood elf history and lore online is a good idea even if you’re not looking to create a complex backstory right from the get-go. While allowing your ideas for your character’s backstory to develop is a good plan, having at least an idea about how these huge events affected their life will definitely help. This will help when you encounter characters of other races, as this history will certainly affect your character’s perspectives. Even though blood elves are aligned with the Horde, they are arguably the black sheep of the family, and there is a great deal of distrust and suspicion on both sides., While this isn’t strictly necessary, it’s highly recommended. A guild is a group of players who have committed to some common goal, share common interests, or simply enjoy playing together. On WoW’s official forums (which can be found at battle.net), each realm has its own subforum. Roleplaying realms will typically have a stickied list at the top of their forums with a guild directory. Just as PvE guilds might focus on social activities or raiding, roleplaying guilds have varied focuses. Some are military in nature—a fighting force. Some are race specific (blood elves only, for example), or class specific (paladins only, hunters only). Still others might focus on more niche activities: treasure hunting, or furthering certain racial or faction goals. The guild directory will usually have a link to the guild’s website or their specific recruitment threads.  Joining a guild varies according to the guild’s processes. However, typically you can expect to fill out an application on the guild’s website. These applications will usually address the type of roleplay you’re interested in, some basic facts about your character, your most active gaming times during the day, and so on. If your application is accepted, you’ll receive an in-game guild invitation which you simply accept in order to become part of the guild.

"If you have perfectly proportioned hourglass curves, look for a dress that has ruffled trims along the collar, sleeves, and bottom hem to avoid throwing your curves out of proportion.  If one area of your body is smaller in proportion than another, look for a dress that places ruffles over that portion. For instance, if you have a small bust and wide hips, look for horizontal ruffles that add volume and detail to your bust.  Some women may be able to pull this look off, but for many, the ruffles are bound to cross over a problem area they would rather mask. If you have a rectangle body type, however, a tiered ruffle dress may provide a welcome increase in volume.  Ruffled dresses can look girlish, but a sultry high heeled sandal may give your look the spice it needs to boost it into womanliness.  Many ruffled dresses have a naturally sweet appearance, and a cute flat or kitten heel can coordinate well with that sweetness without pushing the cuteness over the top.  A ruffled dress may put even more ruffles on your body than a blouse or skirt. Avoid embellishment overkill by sticking with one or two extremely simple pieces of jewelry, like pearl post earrings or a delicate choker necklace.

"Planting pots can be found at most major department stores or home and gardening stores. Plastic planting pots are the easiest to use for this project because the shells will adhere easier to the plastic than clay or terracotta, which require a hot glue gun to hold the shells in place.Spraying a spray cement sealer may also help your shells stick to your pot when using ceramic, clay, or terracotta pots.  Painting your pot allows you to create a different look for the spaces in between the shells, where the pot's color can be seen.;  , Rinse and clean your shells so that there isn’t any leftover sand or dirt in them. Once the shells are clean, leave them out in the sun to dry or wipe them down with a dry rag., Lay out your shells so you can get a visual for what they might look like on your pot. You can use any kind of shells and ones that differ in size and shape. Using different sorts of shells will make your planter more unique and eye catching.Try to think of different designs that you can create using different types and sizes of shells.  For instance, if you have long, thinner shells, you can arrange them in a star position.  A common seashell planter idea is to get shells of about the same size and cover the entirety of the pot.  Starting from the bottom, begin to apply your seashells to the pot using a hot glue gun to hold them in place. Use your hot glue gun to put a dab of glue on the bottom of the shell then apply it to the pot. Once they are held in place, you’ll want to reinforce the shells by using a stronger glue, like Gorilla or super glue, to hold the shells in place for the long run. Drip the glue on the sides of the shell so that it adheres to the pot.  If you only use hot glue, then your shells will slide off when it gets hot outside.  Hanging your seashells upside down will prevent them from gathering water inside and attracting bugs., This is an optional step if you want to increase the longevity of your seashell planter and ensure that none of the shells fall off. Apply sanded grout that you’ve purchased from an arts and crafts store over the surface and in between the cracks of the shells on your planter. Allow the grout to set for 20 minutes, then use a warm rag to wipe down any excess grout on top of the shells or in between the cracks., If you don’t allow your glue to dry, the shells may come off your seashell planter. Once the glue on your planter is completely dry, you can place it outside in your garden, or inside depending on what kind of plant it is.  ","get a terracotta, clay, or plastic planting pot. rinse your shells under cold water. lay out your shells on the ground. glue your seashells to the side of the pot. apply sanded grout to hold your shells in place. allow your seashell planter to dry overnight before using it.

"There are a number of different grades of tile to choose from, and you must identify the grade that fits the climate in which the building is situated. Just as vitally, you must determine whether you would prefer clay or concrete tiles (various grades based on climatic conditions are available for both). They differ in a number of ways, and so the choice is a significant one.Clay tiles are considered to be one of the longest-lasting roofing materials available, even substantially longer than concrete ones. While concrete roofing tiles are typically expected to survive 30-50 years, in the right conditions a well made clay roof might be expected to last 100 years.  Though durable, clay tiles can be more expensive (and neither option is particularly cheap). One estimate illustrates the importance of the price difference: to place a concrete tile roof on a fairly common home with a roof area of 1,500 square feet could cost between $6,000 and $15,000; it could cost between $10,500 and $45,000 to give a clay tile roof to the same house.Finally, the color of concrete tiles are more prone to fade over time than that of clay tiles. For any roof that you will likely have for multiple decades, this is certainly an issue to think about.;  , To put it in simplest terms, a basic asphalt shingle (perhaps the most common roofing material in America) will typically place a weight of less than 3 pounds per square foot on a roof. Concrete tiles, which are usually lighter than clay tiles, can easily place over 10 pounds of weight per square foot on a roof. If you are adding tiles to a roof that did not previously have them, or to a design which did not originally incorporate them, the roof may not be capable of carrying the excess weight. In his case, you will need to have your roof inspected and possibly reinforced to bear the load., While some of these are common--for example, it is recommended that you have a ladder--others are rather specific to this task and are items that are likely not yet in your inventory. For example:  Gasket nails are a type of nail with an interior plastic cap that will help seal nail holes and prevent leaks.Underlay or underlayment. This is the water-resistant layer between the tiles and the roof frame and sheathing. A number of varieties are available, but because this is a roof intended to last from 30 to 100 year, it is probably a good idea to invest in one of the heavy-duty options.Outdoor caulking or sealant. There are a number of caulks or sealants available for outdoor use, but once again it is recommended that you use especially durable and high quality products. This roof could last a lifetime, but it won't if the materials don't suit the requirements of the job. , The most important staring point comes from your roof dimensions. You can use this calculator to help you determine the size of your roof (do not use the function titled 'Tile Calculator,' which is clearly intended for interior floor tile).  Without specific information about the type of tile selected, it is impossible to estimate the number of tiles necessary to complete a job. A 100 square foot section of roof could require anywhere from 75 to 400 tiles.  If you are going to replace the roof of an existing home, you must factor in the weather and the time you have available in which to complete this job. While it is obvious that you aren't going to want to rip your roof on during the winter, you must also look for dry days. Check the long-term weather reports (with an understanding that forecasts do change). Also, make sure you have enough manpower available to complete this project in a timely manner. This is not a one person job, and you will have to plan accordingly.  While you are obtaining the materials, do consult with hardware store employees who may have special knowledge about the products. If customers have been complaining about a faulty product, they may have some knowledge about it.  This is, on its own, a major job that can take days and require special tools. Be prepared to take the time to do this right.  You should have reinforced the frame of the roof earlier before stripping any existing roof off. That said, the sheathing--the layer of wood or other material that covers the area between the relatively open frame and the outer layers of roofing--may be damaged or weak. Strengthen it.  Again, think about the weight involved. The fairly cheap and common shingle roofs that many people have are quite light; if you are transitioning from a light roof to a tile roof, the weight difference will be substantial. For a relatively average house with a 1,500 square foot roof, the total of underlayment and tiles will equal something approaching 8 tons in weight. That's more than the equivalent of having two large SUVs parked on top of your house., As you roll out the underlay, keep the bottom edge of the material aligned with the edge of the eave but above any metal or synthetic edging that may cover the borders of the eave.  Secure the underlayment. Roll out 10 foot (3 m)-long sections at a time, and then secure it with nails separated by intervals of 24 inches. Keep all nails at least 2 inches from the edge of the roof.  When you reach the end of the roof, cut the underlayment roll to match the edge. Secure the end with nails.  Restart at the end of the roof at which you first began. Overlap the underlayment, with the new layer partially covering that which was already applied. There may be a series of lines along the roll of underlayment, and this is intended to show the installer precisely how much the layers should overlap. Treat the top line on the installed layer as you previously had the bottom edge of the eave.  Objects such as chimneys that project out from the roof will have to be sealed up as well. Metal flashing should be used around the chimney, and these should be sealed using caulk or other sealants specifically designed for outdoor use. Underlayment should be cut to fit around these obstacles, and then an additional layer of material (spare slices of the underlayment material, for example) should be placed over the areas where the flashing and underlayment meet and secured in place.  If the roof has a steep slope, battens may be required to hold the tiles in place. Battens are thin strips of material (usually wood, but sometimes metal or plastic, and commonly 1 inch thick and 2 inches wide) that run horizontally along the length of the roof. Many tile varieties possess a lip or hook that will hang on available battens. (Obviously this is one more thing to consider when identifying the tile that fits your needs) In addition, clips are available to attach the tiles onto the batten.  Use two tiles to determine the spacing required for the battens. A minimum of a 3 inch overlap is required for the tiles that do not interlock (interlocking tiles will take care of the measurement for you), and a smaller amount of overhang should be left over the eaves. Factor this in as you determine the locations of the battens.  After you have determined the distance between the first two battens, measure the distance and set battens using that spacing all the way up, making sure to double check measurements as you go along.  Start with one side first, and then move along the length of the roof.  If you have not installed battens, you can nail the tiles directly into the sheathing.  If you have installed battens first, you will nail the tiles into the battens. You can also use clips to anchor the tiles to the battens.  If your are using tiles that tightly interlock, it may not be necessary to nail all the tiles to the sheathing or battens; read the instructions that come with the tiles closely for details.  Obstacles like the chimney will get in the way, and tiles will have to be cut to fit tightly around these areas. Additionally, tiles at the end of each row will almost certainly have to be cut.  After you have completed the 'fields'--that is, the broad surfaces of the roof--you will need to cap the tops with special ridge tiles. These are rounded, and depending upon design can either be laid out end-to-end or in an overlapping style. This should be the final step in the process of installation. Congratulations are due for your successful assembly of a new tile roof!

"If you want to drink responsibly, then the first thing you should do is avoid drinking alone, or drinking with people you don't really know or trust all that well. If you're out on your own and have no one looking out for you, you can get in all kinds of trouble without anyone even knowing something's wrong. Whether you're heading to a party or out to the bars, always make sure to drink with a group of people you like and trust.  Don't drink with people who encourage binge drinking or look down on you for not drinking, or for not 'keeping up' and drinking a lot. You should be comfortable to drink at your own pace.  Don't go out with people who have a reputation for running off to hook up with someone they meet at a bar or just disappearing in the middle of the night. Make sure you go with people you can rely on.;  , When you go out with friends, at least one of them should be a person who knows her own limit, or even who doesn't drink very much, and will be willing to watch out for you and to tell you when it looks like you've had enough. Sometimes, you could be drinking way over your limit while being too stubborn to admit it, and this friend can let you know when it's time to switch to water.  This friend can tell you when you've had enough, keep you from driving, and be prepared to take you home if you're having a rough night.  Don't abuse the 'buddy system' -- if you're always that girl, no one will want to go out with you. You should be able to look out for your friend while she looks out for you.  Before all else, know yourself and your own limits. It doesn't take long to learn how little or how much alcohol you can tolerate and every body is unique in its ability to tolerate alcohol. Listen to your body and respond in a way that nurtures it rather than abuses it. The first time you drink, you should drink with close friends in the comfort of your own home or their homes, so that you don't get socially overwhelmed. This will help you get a sense of what you can and can not handle.  You can set your limits very concretely. Your limits could be 'four glasses of wine in six hours,' 'four beers a night,' or 'two mixed drinks a night' (depending on what's in them). Tell yourself what your limits are before you leave so that you're more likely to stick to them throughout the night.  If it's your first time out drinking, it's important to adopt a steady and slow pace, so that you can come to learn your alcohol tolerance.  If you're going out with friends, you should know exactly how you're getting home the night before. There are a few options: the easiest is to have a designated driver before you go out, so you have a person who will forgo alcohol that night and gets you home safely. You can also get home by taking a bus or other forms of public transportation or just call a cab or walk if you're close enough to the bar. Any of these plans are fine.  What you should not do is drive to the bar and hope that one of your friends can drive you home, or let someone who you know will drink a lot drive you there, hoping that someone else can take over the car later.  If you don't drive or have access to a car, regardless of the circumstance, never get into a car driven by someone else who has had too much to drink.  Never get into a car with a stranger if you're intoxicated. Alcohol affects your senses and judgment. Get his or her number and wait until you are sober before you decide to pursue him or her further.  Even if you're desperate to get home, it's better to pay for a cab or call a trusted friend to pick you up than to get in the car with someone who is drunk or a stranger just because it's more convenient.  Never drive drunk. Don't drive if you're even tipsy. Just one drink per hour can put you over the legal limit for driving. Even if you think you 'feel fine,' your BAC may indicate otherwise.  If you're in the United States, that means 21, and if you're in other parts of the world, that age can typically range from 16-18. Don't go out with a fake ID or drink on a college campus if you're under 21, unless you're prepared to deal with the legal repercussions. If you're breaking the law, you're not being responsible.  Alcohol is a depressant, so if you're already feeling angry, upset, or just unstable, it is very likely to make you feel worse. Though you may think that drinking will make you have the time of your life and forget all of your problems, it'll actually make you feel much worse. You may feel an initial buzz and relief after your first drink or two, but you'll drink yourself into a much worse mood than you started with.  You should make a rule of only drinking when you're happy, not when you want to cope with your sadness.  Don't ever use drinking as a way to deal with your problems. You'll have to be sober to do that.  Don't go out and drink with someone you're mad at. The alcohol will make your anger come out, and you'll be much better off if you settle your conflicts when you're in a lucid frame of mind.  You will feel the effects of alcohol a lot faster if you drink on an empty stomach and increase the likelihood of feeling sick. Most food is better than none at all, but you should try to eat a more hearty meal that is rich in carbs and proteins that can help you absorb the alcohol, instead of just eating some fruit or a salad. Having a meal before you go out will make you much less likely to drink over your limit very quickly.  If you've arrived at a bar and realize you haven't eaten, order some food and have a quick bite to eat before you start drinking. Don't worry if this is a bit inconvenient or if it keeps you from drinking for a little while. It'll be worth it.  If you're on a prescription medication, check with your doctor to make sure that you can drink alcohol on the same day when you took it. It varies by medication, so make sure that you know if your prescription will have any negative interactions with alcohol before you start drinking., If you're running on two or three hours of sleep, you'll be much better off hitting the hay than hitting up a bar. Alcohol will affect you much more intensely if you're already feeling woozy, tired, and not in control of your own mind and body because you're exhausted.  You may have stayed up studying for an exam the night before and could be dying for a celebratory drink with your friends, but you should hold off for another night until you feel well-rested.  Don't think that having a super dose of caffeine by chugging three cups of coffee or downing an energy drink will make things better. In fact, mixing a lot of caffeine and alcohol will make you feel even worse and more likely to crash.  Alcohol dehydrates and draws vitamins and minerals out of your body. Drink water, soda or water with added vitamins to restore your lost vitamins.  Drinking a one to one ratio of non-alcoholic to alcoholic beverages is a good policy – that's one serving of water for every serving of alcohol. It's always preferable to have a greater ratio of non-alcohol to alcohol.  While it's good to try something out for the first time, like a 'Sex On The Beach' or a beer you've never had before, be aware of its alcohol content before stocking up on more than one. You may not always be able to detect the strength of the alcohol in your drink owing to sweeteners, milk or cream or other fillers that cover the alcohol. Moreover, your own personal reaction to an unfamiliar drink may be faster inebriation than with your usual drinks.  Some contents of mixed drinks can bring up your Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) more quickly than others, depending on your weight. Alcohol tolerance, like many believe, will not result in a lower BAC compared to a person who doesn't have tolerance built up.  It's true that beers are a safer choice than a mixed drink, but you should know the alcohol content of the beer you're drinking. Though many have an alcohol content of 4-5%, some beers can have an alcohol content of 8-9% or more, which can make a big difference.  If you want to drink responsibly, then you should have no more than one drink per hour. 'One drink' means one 12 oz. beer, one 5 oz. a glass of wine, or one 1.5 oz. shot of 40% alcohol per hour. It may be tough to stick to this limit when your friends are drinking much more, but this is the way to be safe. Sipping on a beer or nursing a glass of wine will take longer than taking a shot and is recommended because the alcohol won't hit you all at once.People often have more than one drink per hour just because they have nothing to do with their hands and start fidgeting or feeling nervous when they're not holding a drink. If this is the case with you, just hold onto a water or a club soda in between drinks so there's always something in your hands.  It's important to keep a steady pace when you're drinking. It can take time for alcohol to take its effect. You might feel okay for another shot after a couple of minutes, but keep in mind that you probably haven't felt its effects just yet. Nibble on some food or drink some water in the meantime, to allow the alcohol to diffuse through your body.  Though drinking games like bullshit, kings, beer pong, and flip-cup may be a great way to pass time at a party and make some friends you'll never remember, these games encourage extreme binge drinking and are guaranteed to make you forget where you are in just a few minutes.  You can also play these games by discreetly pouring out the alcohol you 'should' drink, or passing it on to a friend who hasn't had a lot to drink.  If you're at a house party, get acquainted with the people who own the house and its facilities. Know where the bathroom is. Find a secluded place and choose to keep your shoes or coat there (but never your purse or wallet). If you find that you are losing control, quickly make an excuse ('I left my phone in my coat pocket!') and go to that secluded place to calm down and/or to dump drinks. If you need to get home, find the house owners and ask them to call a taxi or to arrange for a sober person to take you home.  If you're in a public place, make note of all of the exits upon your arrival. You should do this instinctively in case of an emergency such as a fire outbreak so that you know in advance the closest point of exit. It is also helpful to know where the nearest cab rank or public transportation stop is located to the place you're at. Don't make things harder for yourself; always have an exit strategy.  Make sure you know how to get home by heart. If you get drunk to the point of losing your memory, your self-preservation will be as impaired as your inhibitions and you may become easily lost. If you don't know how to get home, you probably shouldn't go out drinking.  Always remember that you're drinking to enjoy and have fun, not to show off. The whole point of drinking is to enjoy the drink, enjoy the company and feel free. You don't need to 'keep up,' or engage in stupid competitions that could ruin the night and even friendships. If you're hanging out with people who encourage you to drink more even though you don't want to, then you're hanging out with the wrong people.  If you really want people to stop bugging you about why you're not drinking more, hold a club soda or Coke in your hands and put a lime in it so people will think you're driving and will leave you alone. This is a good short-term solution; the long-term solution is to stay away from people who put unwanted pressure on you.  Symptoms of intoxication include feeling a loss of control over your thoughts, blurry vision, slurred speech, and difficulty with maintaining your balance.  While this is generally a given, it's important that you don't attempt to drink any more alcohol, even if you feel 'better' once you've thrown up. Vomiting is a signal that your body can't take the amount of alcohol that you have consumed and the rejection is your body's last line of defense coming into play. At this stage, you have truly overdone it and it's now time to care about your health rather than your partying.  If you feel the urge to vomit, then you should go to a bathroom and do it. Vomiting is a way for your body to release the excess of alcohol that doesn't belong in your system. You shouldn't force yourself to vomit, but you shouldn't hold it in, either.  Whether you've thrown up, feel like you might throw up, or just feel terrible, you should lie down on your side to prevent yourself from choking on your vomit if you're lying on your back. Keep a bucket by your mouth and be prepared to throw up if it's necessary. If you find yourself in this unpleasant state, don't go home by yourself -- have a trusted friend stay the night so she can watch over you when you need help.  If you are feeling sick, experiencing headaches or anything feels wrong, tell someone. A responsible person needs to keep a watch over you in case you've developed alcohol poisoning and need medical intervention quickly.  If you see someone else who is really sick lying down, make sure to turn that person over on his or her side, too.  Though you may think that alcohol may give you some liquid courage to finally talk to, or to hook up with your crush, it can actually impair your decision-making process and can lead you to do something you'll deeply regret later. You can flirt a little, get a guy or girl's number, and check back in when you're sober, but you should avoid going home with anyone you just met, or even just making out at a bar -- it's not classy behavior, and you won't be proud of yourself later.  If you've walked into a party and a guy offers you a drink right away, don't accept it unless you see him make it or grab it for you so you know exactly what it's the drink. If the guy just grabs you a beer from a cooler, then that's fine, but if he disappears into the kitchen and returns with a 'mystery drink' that may be filled with alcohol or even date-rape drugs, then you'll be in the middle of a very dangerous situation.  You don't have to be rude about declining the drink. Just be honest about your reasoning. It's better to look unfriendly than to be in danger.  Your drink should be in your hand or at least in your sight at all times, whether you're at a party or at a bar. If you set your drink down and walk away, someone could mess with your drink, or you could even end up picking up a stronger drink by mistake, thinking it was yours.  If you get up to go to the restroom, get a close friend to hold your drink for you or take it with you. This will help you avoid anyone tampering with your drink.

This way, you can erase mistakes or change your mind. Before you begin designing your henna tattoo, make sure you have a good, sharp pencil on hand., If you intend to create a henna design for your hand, you can begin by tracing your hand on a sheet of paper. This gives you a sense of scale and shape for your unique henna design.  If you are creating a design for another location, it is still a great idea to begin with an outline that depicts the ultimate size and shape of your henna tattoo.  Be sure to use regular white copy paper if you are going to use this design to create a tattoo stencil.  This central mandala comprises the “palm” of your design, while the other details make up the “fingers.” You can start by pinpointing the center of your palm and creating a spiral, flower, or star that emanates from this center.

"Driving should be done with clothing that doesn’t limit the driver. In the winter, coats can interfere with proper steering as well as with proper adjustment of the seat and the operation of seat belts. Choose light and comfortable clothes.  Footwear is obligatory. The shoes have to be placed snugly on the feet (unlike slippers) and fit nicely on the pedals (unlike boots, muddy soles, or high heels). A shoe with a thin but slightly dense sole is ideal.  The driver is also advised to wear a set of pants that run all the way down to the knee, even if it means wearing a set of pants over shorts or a swim-suit.;  , Make sure you sit straight and that your buttocks and back are square and completely squeezed into the seat. This helps to avoid backaches, possible back injuries and maintains awareness during long drives.  The seat should always be positioned with regard to the pedals. Press the brake pedal fully with your right foot and fully depress the clutch (in a manual transmission car) or dead pedal (in an automatic). The distance should be adjusted so that with fully depressed pedals, your knees remain slightly bent (about 120 degrees).  To make sure your check is accurate, start the engine and press on the brakes a few times before performing the check to build up pressure.  If the knee straightens, you are too far back. If it's bent close to 90 degrees, it's too close.  A fully extended leg results in the knee locking-up. This reduces the leverage and feel of the pedals, increases effort, and puts you in risk of severe injuries to the feet in a collision;the straight knee will be fractured whereas the bent knee would fold down. Furthermore, the bone would project the shock up to the pelvic and lower spine.  A knee excessively bent (when the driver sits too close) at an angle of about 100 degrees, does not support the body effectively and results in bad blood circulation. It can also hit the under-dash in a collision.  The thighs should be placed as far apart as is comfortable. In small cars, most people can create a wide enough base as to lean their knees against the center console on one side and the door on the other.  The feet should be placed with the heels on the floor and the balls of the feet pressing against the pedals. The right foot in particular should be able to pivot between the throttle and brake pedal while the heel is placed roughly in front of the brakes. This might mean that you don't cover the brake pedal fully when pressing it and that pressing the throttle is done with the foot at an angle, contacting the pedal close to its lower edge. This is the correct way to utilize the feet.  The left foot should be resting over the dead-pedal whenever not working on the clutch (or, in an automatic, at all times). This increases support to the pelvis and allows the driver to brace the body by applying pressure against the footrest in corners or in events of strong braking instead of hanging onto the pedals or steering.  This should be as parallel as possible to the steering. It is impossible to reach a perfect adjustment (and it's also not really necessary), but by adjusting the rake of the seat to an upright angle of about 110-95 degrees, we can reach a suitable adjustment.  We cannot reach a perfect adjustment because placing the seat too upright will put pressure on the lower vertebrae, place our head too high, and because the steering itself is placed in an angle. We can adjust the seat back to a relatively upright position and then use the adjustment of the steering itself to place it as parallel to the back as possible.  After adjusting the seat, including the height and the adjustments to the steering itself (below), we check the adjustment in the following manner: We place the wrist of our hand just over the topmost portion of the wheel. We should be able to place the wrist flat over the wheel and even bend it somewhat over the rim, while still keeping the shoulders (shoulder-blades) against the seat's back. This should be done with the arm straight but without putting in excessive effort.  If our wrist only touches the face of the wheel (rather than be placed flat over it), or it we can only put the heel of the palm on the wheel, or if we need to lean our scapulae (shoulder-blades) forward -- we are too far back. This will make us lean forward somewhat when we steer.  If we can touch the top of the wheel with our forearm or touch the top of the wheel with the wrist with the hand bent, we are too close to the wheel.  In vehicles with large, horizontal steering rims (mainly trucks), we cannot reach such a posture and we just need to check that we can grip the topmost portion of the wheel without locking the elbow fully and without bouncing the scapulae forward.  Where adjustable, the steering height should be adjusted to as parallel to back angle, and to a clear view of the dashboard through the rim. The ideal adjustment should also allow us to grip the wheel properly (at 9 and 3, see below), with our palms just lower than our shoulders.  Where adjustable, this should be adjusted with the steering wheel height, to as parallel to the back as possible. While gripping the wheel properly, our elbows should be bent at about 120 degrees. There should be a minimal clearance of 10' (and preferably 30cm) between the center of the steering hub and the base of the breastbone (sternum). It should also not be further away that 45 centimeter (17.7 in).  This should allow us to see forward clearly, while still having a clear view of the dashboard, and proper height relative to the wheel and pedals. In most cars, the proper height for forward vision should allow us to place five fingers (a hand width) between our head and the ceiling.  In cars with open or high ceiling, adjust so that you eyes are placed just above the center of the glass, without the visor obstructing your forward vision when open.  After readjusting the height, recheck the feet to make sure the height adjust had not compromised it.  Place the headrest to a height just above your eyelids, and (more importantly) -- as close to the head as possible (2-3cm). A head-restraint further than 7 centimeter (2.8 in) increases the risk of whiplash. Keep in mind that while driving our head bends forward a bit more. If you cannot adjust the head-restraint to the proper distance, you need to compensate by increasing the backrest tilt.  Lumbar support: Should provide equal pressure across the whole length of the back. For drivers with lumbar problems without such an adjustment, you can use one or two rolled towels.  Side Bolsters: Should be adjusted for the maximum possible hip support without limiting the ability to depress all pedals fully.  Seat base reclining: Should keep the thigh in full contact with the seat. Avoid too much reclining which will create pressure behind your knees, or interfere with strong braking (you should not apply pressure against the seat).  Pedal adjustments: Should allow operation of the pedals as described above as comfortably as possible. You should be able to place your heel roughly in front of the brakes, place your foot on the brakes with the slightest possible offset to the right, and pivot as easily as possible towards the throttle pedal on the right, while keeping your knee bent at about 100 degrees.  Your hands should both be on the wheel, at the 9 and 3 position. This increases the leverage on the wheel to a maximum. Your palms should be placed against the outer diameter of the wheel and the thumbs should be lightly hooked on the cross-brace of the wheel.  Grip and stabilize the wheel not only with the thumbs and/or palms, but mainly with your fingers and fingertips. In general, keep the grip of the wheel as light as possible without losing your control over the wheel. This results in better control and less fatigue.  Keep both hands on the wheel. Steering with one hand makes the weight of the hand work on the wheel, for which the shoulder muscles must be used to keep the wheel steady, resulting in a twist of the spine, especially if you get into the (bad) habit of holding the wheel from its top.  Adjust the lap-belt as snugly as possible over the waist. The belt should be physically tightened and placed as low as possible, on the pelvic bones, rather than the soft belly.  The shoulder strap should be adjusted to the height, so that the mounting is higher than the shoulder, and that the strap itself is placed over the acromion (middle of the shoulder), which is felt as a socket midway between the arm and neck.  If the shoulder strap is placed on the neck or even on the collar bone (clavicle), it is too high and will cause fractures to the clavicle and cuts the neck.  If the strap is placed too low on the shoulder itself or on the arm/under the armpit, it will not support the body and cause severe cuts to the arm.  All passengers should be strapped, and little children need to be harnessed in the suitable child seats and boosters. There are also special straps for pets. There are also other points that are worthwhile for the passengers:  Head restraint adjustment  Window adjustment  Proper placing of limbs relative to airbags: Avoid placing feet over the passenger's airbag or placing hands in the way of the lateral or curtain airbags, etc...  Proper distance from the dashboard  Full and erected seating: Full contact of the back and the seat, and an erected rake angle for the front passenger, to avoid 'submarining under the lap belt.  Awareness: Falling asleep is dangerous for passengers. The front passenger should be awake to monitor and assist the driver, and to avoid acute abdominal injuries in a collision, which are intensified when the person is asleep.  Not all seats of the car are equally safe. The middle-rear seat is considered safest, followed by the seat behind front passenger seat, then the seat behind the driver, the front passenger seat and the driver being in the greatest threat. This division changes in cars with additional seats (minivans) or when the middle-back lacks a diagonal or adjustable belt or a head-restraint.  With this position, your eyes will be placed in front of the center or upper half of the glass for improved visibility. Keep your eyes relaxed rather than trying and focus, and keep the eyes up rather than down. You will see more and further away, while still being aware of your surrounding with your peripheral vision.  Adjust your mirrors to give you a broad field of vision to the rear and sides (see in links below) at the glance of an eye or a slight tilt of the head (if you have a narrow field of vision due to illness or age). In some cars, you might also need to be ready to lean slightly forward or take a slight peek to the side ('Shoulder check') to make sure you see everything around while driving.  Do not keep anything around the driver's seat, because it might slip under the pedals.  In general, anything not stock is not wanted: A convex mirror mounted on the center mirror, a padded cover of the steering wheel, things dangling about on your rear-view mirror -- these are all bad things that can also prove hazardous in an accident.  Windows, in this respect, are best either completely closed, slightly opened or almost fully opened, rather than half-way down, in which case the head of the driver or one of the passengers might hit it. Always keep one of your front windows slightly opened for fresh air.  Open windows on highways can create drag that impairs fuel consumption and even the stability of the car, so it's best to only keep one or two windows slightly opened at most.  On rugged terrain, the windows should be fully closed or fully opened to avoid rocking the window's bushings.  Windows, lights and spectacles should be kept clean.  While it is possible to fit a quality, vacuum-adhesive interior mirror to view the back seat, in long drives with the whole family, it's best for the front passenger to be the one in charge of the inside of the car, and for the driver to focus himself on the road. Do not adjust your stock interior mirror to see the back seat and do not use wide-angle convex mirrors as well.  Likewise, avoid placing a child in the front seat, regardless of child restraints or airbags.  It's better to use the car heat in the winter instead of driving with heavy clothing that interferes with steering and with the function of the seat belt. Keep one window slightly open for fresh air both in the summer (for oxygen) and winter (for fresh cold air).  The air conditioning is there to be used -- open the A/C periodically, even in the winter, and open the heating periodically -- even in the summer -- to ensure proper mechanical function of the two over time.  A/C air recirculation is very efficient because is blows large amounts of air. However, you need some fresh air through the driver's window. Likewise, if the windscreen is very heavily misted, opening the A/C for fresh air (along with an open window) can do better. Using external circulation is also efficient when you try to cool down a very hot cabin before entering it.  The A/C can also clear out bad smells. A few minutes before you turn off the car, close the air conditioner and air circulation, but keep the fan blowing air. This will channel out waste in the air ducts via a little hose inside it. Likewise, in a hot summer day, it's worthwhile to keep the heating blowing full time with all windows and doors open, to refresh the cabin.  The heating is also a good choice for when the engine starts to overheat. In highways, stopping on the hard-shoulder is so perilous that it is better to keep on driving towards a safe stopping place, even in the price of causing damage to the car (like overheating the engine). Using the heating to disperse engine heat can help reaching a safe stopping place without the engine reaching critical levels of heat.

"While entry-level jobs on oil rigs are plentiful and technically don't require any experience, few companies will hire a 'green hand' to work on their billion-dollar platforms.  In general, oil rig workers only need to be 18 or older, have a high school diploma, and pass a pre-employment drug test. Successful applicants have usually pursued oil rig training independently or bring transferable skills to the job. All workers must meet certain minimum standards and certifications to work on an oil rig.;  , Since many oil rigs are in international waters or even in foreign countries, it is important to be aware of what documents you’ll need if you must enter another country for the work. Most companies will arrange for a current work visa for people working outside their native country.  Oil rig jobs are available in some of the world's most exotic locations, including the coasts of Africa and the waters of Southeast Asia. Workers from other regions often get jobs in these areas, but they must complete a full course of immunizations before they will be hired.  Some of the most common required vaccinations include Hepatitis A; Hepatitis B; Tetanus; Polio; Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR); Meningitis; Typhoid Fever; Seasonal Influenza; and Yellow Fever., Many trade schools and colleges offer classes on various facets of the oil industry, including oil rig work. Most classes blend coursework with hands-on field experience. Companies often provide training for workers looking to advance their careers in specialized fields., All offshore workers are required to earn an Offshore Survival & Firefighting certificate. Specialized workers like electricians, scaffolders, and welders must hold a state-issued license or certificate in order to work on a rig., Most oil rig crews, both onshore and offshore, work grueling 12-hour shifts. Rotations vary, but most companies keep crews on site for two weeks and then give workers two weeks off. , Entry-level oil rig jobs are physically taxing. Most involve moving supplies and heavy equipment, like drill pipes. This kind of work requires a level of strength and endurance that other jobs might not., Oil rigs are often located in places with extreme weather conditions. Offshore and onshore rigs offer distinct challenges.  Onshore rigs. Most oilfields in the United States are in the unforgiving climate of the Southwest, where summertime temperatures regularly exceed 100 degrees F (37.7 C). Drilling in the petroleum-rich fields of Canada reaches full capacity during the bitterly cold winter months, when the frozen ground is better able to withstand heavy equipment and exploration procedures.  Offshore rigs. Workers on offshore oil rigs are at the mercy of the elements, too. North Sea platforms are battered year-round by strong winds and unyielding waves. Rigs dotting the U.S. coastline in the Gulf of Mexico are on alert during the hurricane season (June 1 to November 30).  The contents of an oil well are under extreme pressure, but that's only part of the danger rig workers face daily. Cranes are constantly moving massive sections of pipe across the platform. Highly combustible gases are used in everyday operations that include welding and pipe-cutting. All of these aspects of oil rigs constitute a fairly constant level of danger that requires workers to be on guard and prepared to handle emergency situations.  An oil rig is a place where you really can work hard to get ahead. Most crane operators, shift supervisors and other skilled workers started out in entry-level positions. They set themselves apart by pursuing advanced oil rig training and accepting additional assignments. If you have previous experience, advanced qualifications or training, etc., you may be able to apply for non-entry level positions.  If working on an oil rig is a long-term goal of yours or if you want to begin working at the highest level possible, it might be a good idea for you to pursue training options and certifications before you apply so that you are more qualified for non-entry level positions.  There are a variety of jobs available for employment on oil rigs. Think about what kind of work you enjoy doing and what job might best fit with these ideas.  If you enjoy cooking more than manual labor, consider applying to be a chef for the oil rig crew. If you want to learn a specific trade (like welding), you might want to apply to be a helper or apprentice to a welder or other specialist on the oil rig.  There are many jobs available for inexperienced workers to begin their careers.Roughneck: Roughnecks are general laborers who usually work on the rig deck. They move equipment and supplies, and also are responsible for cleaning equipment and work areas.Roustabout: These workers are involved in drilling operations. They often move sections of drill pipe and clean spill. Roustabouts aspire to one day become the tool pusher, the senior supervisor on a rig.Helper: Helpers assist skilled personnel, serving as apprentices for rig electricians, lead welders, and heavy-equipment operators.Painter: Offshore oil rigs, in particular, must be painted constantly to protect the structure from the corrosive effects of saltwater. This is a hazardous duty, as painters often must be suspended in harnesses to reach remote areas of the platform.  Motorman: Motormen maintain and repair all rig machinery, including generators and deck equipment. Deckhand: Deckhands build tow lines to secure barges and boats to the structure, facilitating loading and offloading of cargo.  Steward: Housekeeping needs, including laundry service and janitorial duties, must be met to ensure the smooth operation of an oil rig.  Assistant chef: Galley hands, including assistant chefs, work around the clock to prepare meals for all shifts. This is a job where mainstream experience is directly transferable to duties on the rig.  ","determine whether you meet the basic requirements. ask about the work visa requirements. get the necessary immunizations. find specialized training courses. complete the required certifications. decide if you are capable of working long shifts. prepare for the physical labor aspects of the job. research the weather conditions at your possible oil rig job. decide if you can manage the aspects of physical danger. consider your qualifications. weigh your personal skills and preferences. choose an entry level position that suits you, if necessary.

"If you are using a towel, make sure that you do not have any fibers from the towel on the index finger you are using to insert the contact lens.  Avoid drying your hands with paper towels, as these tend to leave more fibers on your finger.;  , With her head tilted slightly back, ask her to look forward and then slightly upward. Try not to hover immediately above her eyes; this might cause her to instinctively blink more. Instead, place her shoulder against your side, so she is standing next to you, as opposed to in front of you.  This will ensure that the contact lens is not inside out. Make sure that the lens you have on your finger corresponds to the correct eye. It is likely that your child may need a different prescription strength in each eye, so make sure you have selected the correct lens for each eye.  Many contact lens cases will have a label for each eye; for example, the case for the right eye's lens might read 'R' on the lid.  Your child will probably need to gently pull up the skin of his upper eyelid toward his eyebrow using his index finger in order to keep his eye open for the insertion. The bottom eyelid may also need to be pulled gently down, toward the cheek.  The lens should stick to the eye almost like a suction cup once it comes in contact with it. Try to center the lens over the iris of the eye.  As you approach the eye, ask your child not to focus on the lens itself as this will increase her risk of blinking before you can properly insert it. Instead, encourage her to look just to the right of your finger, but while still looking upward.  Make sure the lens is well-lubricated with solution so it is not too dry. If the lens is too dry, it might not come easily off your finger as you try to insert it.  This will help the lens adjust to the curve of the eye. He may need to blink a few additional times to fit the lens. Be sure he does not blink too rapidly because this may cause the lens to fall out.  , It is important that your child learn how to insert her lenses for herself. Many optometrists will request that your child practice inserting a trial pair of contacts at their office. If your child inserts her contact lenses herself, this will also reduce her desire to blink during the application process.  A recent study found that children between the ages of eight and nine were all successfully able to insert their own contact lenses., Make sure your child knows that he should never clean his contacts with water or saliva; instead, he should only use solutions and disinfectants that have been recommended by his optometrist. He must also properly store his contact lenses in an optometrist-approved solution overnight or when not in use., If your child is wearing daily disposable contacts, make sure that she is properly disposing of the pair each evening and not wearing them over a longer period of time. You should ensure that your child is not sleeping in a pair of contact lenses unless the contacts have been approved for overnight use.  If your daughter is wearing make up, make sure she knows that she must insert her contact lenses prior to applying cosmetics. You should also look into using hypoallergenic cosmetic and skincare products for your child when she wears contact lenses.  Is your child very active? Does he participate in many sports or group activities that can be impeded by glasses? Is he worried about breaking her glasses when she is active? 36% of optometrists say that parents request contacts for their children so they can more fully participate in sports.Contacts can also help improve your child's peripheral vision when he participates in sports.  Do glasses negatively impact your child's self-esteem? Does she have poor self-image because she believes her glasses make her look weird or different? Recent studies have indicated that wearing contact lenses can significantly improve a child's self-esteem and her comfort in participating in group activities., Is your child good at following instructions and carrying out daily chores? Does he make his bed and keep his personal space tidy on a regular basis? If he is responsible and mature, then he will be a good candidate to take care of his contact lenses., Doctors will most often prescribe contact lenses for children between the ages of 10–12. These are often prescribed in conjunction with a pair of prescription glasses; at this age, contacts often serve as a secondary form of vision correction. Approximately 12% of doctors will prescribe contacts for children between the ages of eight and nine and a further 12% will prescribe contact lenses for children younger than eight years old.For children, doctors will often prescribe daily disposable contact lenses to minimize the risk of unhygienic storage and handling. Daily disposable lenses typically cost $100 more than longer wear lenses.  In rare cases, optometrists will prescribe contacts for infants suffering from congenital cataracts.  If your child suffers from seasonal allergies, then she might not be the best candidate for contacts as the lenses may cause additional irritation in the eyes.  ","wash your hands with soap and warm water and dry them thoroughly. position your child so she is facing you. place the contact lens so it is curved like a bowl on the tip of your index finger. ask your child to open his eye as wide as possible. gently place the contact lens onto your child's open eye as your child is looking upward. ask your child to take one slow blink. repeat these steps for the other eye. , help your child insert her lenses only on a temporary basis. monitor your child's cleaning habits for his contacts. watch your child's wearing habits. discuss the proper methods of contact lens insertion with your child. consider your child's lifestyle. evaluate your child's self-esteem. consider your child's habits. discuss getting contacts for your child with your optometrist.

"Usually, the best way to impress someone is by not trying too hard. Just be yourself - she’ll probably be able to tell if you’re trying to put on an act. While it’s normal to be nervous, just try to have fun when you talk to her., If you really want to impress her, give her a compliment that shows that you pay attention to her. Instead of dropping a stereotypical pick-up line, say something specific that shows you’ve noticed something unique about her.  For example, if you saw her earlier that day, you could say, “I really like how you wore your hair today,” or “You made such a great point in history class - you’re definitely one of the smartest people I know!”  , Who likes chatting with people who only talk about themselves? Impress her by showing that you’d like to get to know her better. It’s fine to tell her things about yourself, especially if they relate to something she’s told you, but just try not to dominate the conversation.You could ask about her hobbies, her favorite places to be, if she has siblings, or what songs and bands she couldn’t go without.  Try to respond to her answer instead of asking one question after another as if you were interrogating her. For instance, if she said she loves the beach, you could say, “Me too, but only the ocean. No lakes for me!”  , Starting a deeper conversation will show her that you really care about understanding who she is as a person. After some small talk, or after you’ve had a few superficial conversations, try to find a topic that’s close to her heart.You could ask questions about her goals, passions, and dreams, like “What are three things you want to accomplish in life?” Try asking about the qualities she looks for or admires in a person, about her favorite childhood memory, or what the most important thing in the world is to her.  Have patience and give her time to respond before sending another message. In addition, most people prefer one longer message instead of a bunch of messages with just a couple words.Keep the memes to a minimum, too. It’s one thing to send a funny GIF that relates to your conversation, but don’t spam her with tons of random stuff.  ","try to be natural and confident. compliment her. ask her questions instead of talking about yourself. bring the conversation to a deeper level. don’t bombard her with tons of messages. "
"Wash a few bunches of broccoli. Take a sharp knife and carefully trim away the tough end of the stalks. Throw away the ends and any leaves. Chop the broccoli florets and the tender, small stalks. Set the chopped broccoli aside.You should end up with about 4 cups (700 g) of chopped broccoli.;  , Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a medium-sized pot over medium heat. Chop one onion and add it to the heated oil. Saute the onion over medium heat for about 10 minutes.The onion should become translucent. Avoid overcooking the onion to the point that it becomes caramelized or crispy.  Pour in 4 cups (1 liter) of vegetable or chicken stock. Peel and chop 1 russet potato into 1' pieces and add it to the pot. Turn the heat to low and let it simmer (bubble lightly) for about 12 minutes.The potato should be just about tender if you poke it with a fork.  Add the chopped broccoli to the pot and continue simmering the soup for another 10 minutes. Check the broccoli and potato for tenderness. They should be soft enough to puree in a blender or with a handheld blender until the soup becomes smooth.If you want to puree the soup in the blender, carefully ladle the hot soup into the blender and puree it in batches.  Return the pureed soup to the pot and keep it on low heat. Pour in 1/2 cup (120 ml) of heavy cream and stir the soup.

"If the situation seems threatening or dangerous, it's best to get away from the bully. Even if it is not a dangerous situation, remember that you don’t have to listen to someone say mean things to you. The best thing to do might be to calmly walk away from the person. This will send the message that you won’t put up with this kind of treatment.  Try to walk towards people, such as towards a teacher or someone else who will not put up with bullying.;  , It is important to report bullying right away so that it will stop.By telling someone that you are being bullied, you will be standing up for yourself and showing the bullies that you will not put up with their abuse.  Find a teacher, parent, school counselor, or someone else who can help you and immediately tell them what the bully has been saying or doing to you.  Try saying something like, “Joyce is bullying me. She keeps making fun of my weight and she will not stop. I have asked her to stop, but she is still doing it. I think I need some help to make it stop.”  You can also write a note to explain what is happening deliver the note to your teacher, school counselor, or principal.  Tell someone else if the first person you tell does not do anything about the bully. Don’t accept that you will have to put up with the bullying.  Using direct, assertive communication and body language is the best way to address a bully.If a bully continues to harass you even after you have walked away, then let him or her know that you will not put up with the behavior. Turn and face the bully and tell him or her to stop.  To use assertive body language, stand up tall and face the bully. Look the bully in the eye when you are speaking to them. Don’t look down and don’t try to make yourself smaller, such as by folding your arms or bringing your knees in close to your body. Pull yourself up to your full height, keep your arms at your sides, and your feet about shoulder width apart.  Keep your request short and direct. Try saying something like, “Stop it, Jennifer.” Or, “Cut it out, Craig.” As you say this, make sure that you look the bully directly in the eye and speak in a calm, clear voice.  Don’t compliment or insult the bully. If you say nice things to a bully after he or she has been insulting you, putting you down, or physically threatening you, then this will only increase his or her sense of power. Calling the bully names may enrage the bully and increase his or her efforts to hurt you.  It is the bully’s goal to get an emotional response out of you, so do your best to keep calm and avoid showing the bully how you feel. Try your best not to show that you are angry, sad, or frightened. The bully may feed off of these emotions and increase his or her efforts.  Take a few deep breaths and think about something that makes you happy, such as getting a good grade on a test, playing with your dog, or something fun that you are planning to do with your family over the weekend. Doing this may help you to take a step back from the situation and avoid reacting to your emotions. Make sure that you keep your eyes open and maintain eye contact with the bully as you do this.  Respond to the bully in a calm way. For example, you might say, 'Jack, I know you think you're funny but you're not. Stop.' Or, 'Stop now or I'm asking the teacher to move you away from me.'  Be sure to talk about how the bully made you feel with someone later on. Talk with your parents, a school counselor, or a teacher.  ","walk away. tell someone so the bully will stop. look the bully in the eye and tell him or her to stop. stay calm. "

During summer time, Hong Kong can get extremely hot, with over 95% humidity. Always wear thin light color clothes.  A water bottle is a must, as you'll be walking and traveling a lot in the hot weather and will need to restore some of the minerals you've lost. It's very important to stay hydrated.  , The umbrella isn't just for the rain, the sun can really dehydrate you!  , You'll always find yourself either walking up or down to a shop.  Shop around for domestically produced products that you'll find on Nathan Road. They're cheap and quite decent in quality.  Hong Kong is comprised of different islands like Lamma Island and many other small and very interesting islands. Make sure you visit them, they all have something unique.  Macau is another island, which is approximately 90 kilometers (56 mi) away from Hong Kong. You'll need to get there by taking the ferry (Turbo Jet).

"One of the quickest ways to attract the attention of other Instagram users is to begin following them first. Some may return the favor, while others will not. In general, though, following more users will often get more users following you back.  Look for popular users, as well as users who follow many more people than they have followers. These people may want to bulk up their number of followers, and will follow you back. Just dont expect many interactions to come from these accounts.  Followers are lost because of one of two mistakes: posting too much, or not posting enough. People regularly cycle through their list and unfollow boring accounts or inactive accounts, so a good rule of thumb is to make sure that you update your account with entertaining content at least once a day.  It's also common for people to unfollow users who post too much. If you're following thousands of people, your feed might refresh constantly, but people who only follow a few hundred people get a flood of your pictures, which quickly gets annoying.  Micro-communities are accounts on Instagram that involve a wide range of users by sponsoring daily challenges and offering forums. By becoming actively involved in a micro community, you can quickly introduce yourself to other Instagram users. Best of all, these users are eager to be active on Instagram, so they can be more likely to follow new users.  For instance, the @joshjohnson #JJ community offers daily challenges and forums. If you tag your photos with the #JJ hashtag and follow the 1-2-3 rule of the community, you can easily gain new followers. The basic rule is:  For every photo you post, comment on two others and like three more.  You're not the only one on Instagram who wants more followers. There are lots of users who'll advertise their desire for gaining followers by putting 'like for like' or 'follow for follow' in their bio or in their pictures. There are a variety of hashtags associated with follower-gathering accounts, and they're often changing, so keep an eye out for new ones. To find users who are actively seeking followers, browse hashtags like:  likeforlike  like4like  l4l  followforfollow  follow4follow  f4f  ifollowback  teamfollowback  , This is an app geared towards getting you more likes and followers. It generates hashtags that you can copy and paste into the caption bar, then all you have to do is wait for people that are searching for those hashtags to follow you. 'Tag for Likes is an increasingly popular way for people to gain lots of followers quickly.  New follower-gaining apps and techniques are always coming out. Keep an eye out for new ways to connect and for updates to the older, established apps.  People often look for followers on the follower lists of big celebrities, just following a few hundred of the most recent followers on a given account. One little trick commonly used is in following and unfollowing very popular celebrities repeatedly, thereby keeping your name at the top of the 'Recent Followers' list. You can gain lots of followers fairly quickly using this ploy.  Kim Kardashian, One Direction, Justin Bieber, and Instagram itself have some of the most popular accounts.  Technically, doing this is against policy and can result in your account being suspended, so use the technique judiciously.  These programs, though they violate Instagram user agreements, are fantastic ways to find followers. They let you search for similar users, and the bot likes their pictures. As a result, a certain percentage of viewers will click on your page and follow you as a result. Search for 'Instagram Follower Macros' to get started.  The website 'Blackhat' has a collection of frequently-updated macro scripts.  ","follow as many users as possible. update your account once a day to avoid losing followers. join a micro-community or two. follow like-for-like and follow-for-follow accounts. use the tag for likes app. follow and unfollow celebrities repeatedly. use instagram bots to find people likely to follow you.

"Physical therapy is a common treatment for foot drop. During physical therapy, you will be given exercises that work and strengthen the muscles needed to lift your foot and toes. This therapy may be done at home or a physical therapy office.You may be instructed to do stretching exercises as well.  Physical therapy is often combined with other treatments.  This treatment is often covered under insurance, though you may have to pay a copayment.;  , A brace or ankle-foot orthosis is commonly used to treat MS related foot drop. This brace fits around the lower part of the leg and foot. It helps supports the ankle by keeping the foot and ankle in a fixed position.This helps the foot not drop down when you walk.  Wear a sock between your skin and brace or AFO (ankle-foot orthotic) to prevent chafing. You will need to wear shoes that will fit over the brace.  You can get braces that are custom-fitted for your foot and ankle.  These braces are often partially covered by insurance. Check with your insurance company to see what they cover., Functional Electrical Stimulation devices are new devices used to treat foot drop. FES devices emit low-level electrical impulses to nerves in the body that tell the legs to raise the foot. The two FES devices available are WalkAide and NESS L300.These devices are not covered by most insurances.  They are very expensive, costing approximately $5000.  FES devices don’t work for everyone. They won’t work if the MS interferes with the nerves needed to tell the leg to move.  Sometimes, when people get foot drop, their walking gait is altered. This can cause even more difficulties in walking and lead to tripping or unbalanced muscles. Your physical therapist can identify if your gait is affected and work with you using exercises to correct your gait.  ","undergo physical therapy. use a brace. try a functional electrical stimulation (fes) device. treat any gait problems. "
"Archery bows were first developed in the late Paleolithic era, the arrows were made of pine with a long shaft ended with a sharpened flint point.  The development of firearms rendered bows obsolete in warfare. Despite the high social status, ongoing utility, and widespread pleasure of archery in Korea, England, China, Japan, Turkey, Armenia, America, Egypt, India and elsewhere, almost every culture that gained access to even early firearms used them widely, to the relative neglect of archery. Early firearms were vastly inferior in rate-of-fire, and were very susceptible to wet weather. However, they had longer effective range and were tactically superior in the common situation of soldiers shooting at each other from behind obstructions.  They also required significantly less training to use properly, in particular penetrating steel armor without any need to develop special musculature. Armies equipped with guns could thus provide superior firepower by sheer weight of numbers, and highly-trained archers became almost obsolete on the battlefield.  However, archers are still effective and have seen action even in the 21st century. Traditional archery remains in use for sport, and for hunting in many areas.;  , Modern competitive target archery is often governed by the International Archery Federation, abbreviated FITA (Federation Internationale de Tir à l'Arc). Olympic rules are derived from FITA rules:  Target archery competitions may be held indoors or outdoors. Indoor distances are 18 m and 25 m. Outdoor distances range from 30 m to 90 m. Competition is divided into ends of 3 or 6 arrows. After each end, the competitors walk to the target to score and retrieve their arrows.  Archers have a set time limit in which to shoot their arrows.  Targets are marked with 10 evenly spaced concentric rings, which have score values from 1 through 10 assigned to them. In addition, there is an inner 10 ring, sometimes called the X ring. This becomes the 10 ring at indoor compound competitions. Outdoors, it serves as a tiebreaker with the archer scoring the most X's winning. Archers score each end by summing the scores for their arrows. Line breakers, an arrow just touching a scoring boundary line, will be awarded the higher score.  Different rounds and distances use different size target faces. These range from 40 cm (18 m FITA Indoor) to 122 cm (70 m and 90 m FITA, used in Olympic competition).  Field archery involves shooting at targets of varying (and sometimes unmarked) distance, often in rough terrain.  Field rounds are at 'even' distances up to 80 yards (some of the shortest are measured in feet instead), using targets with a black bulls eye (5 points), a white center (4) ring, and black outer (3) ring. Hunter rounds use 'uneven' distances up to 70 yards (64 m), and although scoring is identical to a field round, the target has an all-black face with a white bulls eye.  Children and youth positions for these two rounds are closer, no more than 30 and 50 yards (46 m), respectively. Animal rounds use life-size 2D animal targets with 'uneven' distances reminiscent of the hunter round.  The rules and scoring are also significantly different. The archer begins at the first station of the target and shoots his first arrow. If it hits, he does not have to shoot again. If it misses, he advances to station two and shoots a second arrow, then to station three for a third if needed. Scoring areas are vital (20, 16, or 12) and non-vital (18, 14, or 10) with points awarded depending on which arrow scored first. Again, children and youth shoot from reduced range.  One goal of field archery is to improve the technique required for bowhunting in a more realistic outdoor setting, but without introducing the complication and guesswork of unknown distances. As with golf, fatigue can be an issue as the athlete walks the distance between targets across sometimes rough terrain.  3D archery is a subset of field archery focusing on shooting at life-size models of game and is popular with hunters. It is most common to see unmarked distances in 3D archery, as the goal is to accurately recreate a hunting environment for competition.  Though the goal is hunting practice, hunting broadheads are not used, as they would tear up the foam targets too much. Normal target or field tips, of the same weight as the intended broadhead, are used instead.  Similar to target archery, except that the archer attempts to drop arrows at long range (180 yards/165 m for the men and 140 yards/128 m for women; there are shorter distances for juniors depending on age) into a group of concentric circular scoring zones on the ground surrounding a marker flag. How to score:  Standard Target Faces which are made in different sizes are generally of five colours: gold, red, blue, black and white.  Each coloured circle is divided by a central line, this format is used by both G.N.A.S. and F.I.T.A. Depending on the type of round being shot the colours can have different scoring values.

"Start your moving process by getting rid of the items that you don't need. There's no sense in organizing and trying to pack a bunch of stuff that you'll just get rid of anyway, so pick through your home meticulously and get rid of as much as you can. Go room by room and look for items that you haven't used at all in the last year. Chances are, if more than a year goes by without use, you probably don't need the item.  Everyone has sentimental knickknacks and old papers that they don't want to get rid of. That's fine. But a healthy practice is to keep a small or medium size box that's devoted to these items. Keep only what you can fit in the box. If you want to put in things that are new, you have to empty out things that don't matter to you quite as much any more. This practice will keep you from hoarding items.;  , Next you'll want to get some boxes to pack items in to. You might want to use plastic bins for some items, like papers and clothes, which are sensitive to water and staining. This will keep them from getting damaged. For most other items however, cardboard boxes are the way to go. Use mainly small and medium size boxes and pack them no heavier than 50 lbs.  You can often buy cheap cardboard boxes from auto shops and hardware stores. Avoid the boxes sold by moving companies, as they are often more expensive.  You can also get boxes for free, although they might not be in as good condition. Go to grocery stores, wholesale stores, large cafeterias or restaurants, and liquor stores and ask if they have any boxes you can have for moving. Since they have to take the cardboard to the recycling anyway, they're usually happy to give the boxes away. Liquor store boxes are best for moving, since they're designed to carry very heavy items without breaking.  You will want to rent a few items from your local hardware store or moving company, in order to make this process easier and less back-breaking. Mainly, you'll want a hand truck and possibly a dolly. These will help you transport very heavy items and more than one item at once, speeding up the process and making it easier on your body.  Of course, you'll want other items too. Tape, shrink wrap, pens for labeling, scissors, box cutters, twine and cords are all very useful for packing and moving.  Make a separate box or bag with all the things that you'll need for the first few days after moving. Put things inside like a few changes of clothes, your toiletries, a roll of toilet paper, a few plates and utensils, and maybe a frying pan. This will save you from having to dig through a bunch of boxes right away to get at the things you need most.  Remember to tape the lids closed on liquid items and wrap them in bags. You don't want all of your immediately needed items to be covered in shampoo.  For items that are really important, like all of your moving documents and important documents like birth certificates, you will want to have a separate box or bag. You should also put very expensive items in this box, like your mp3 player and your grandmother's jewelry. This box should be transported in your car with you or on your person.  If you're moving very far, it might be a good idea to have this box shipped ahead of you. Send it to your new home if someone is waiting there to receive it or have it shipped to someone you trust.  Now that you've got all that done, you can start going through the rest of the items in your home. Go room by room and try to keep similar items together. Place heavier items at the bottom of boxes and try to evenly distribute the weight between boxes. Make sure the box is full and if it's not, fill it with packing paper. If the top of the box has nothing below it, it will be more prone to collapsing, which can break the items in your box. As you pack, be sure to label everything clearly.  Make an inventory list as you go, numbering the boxes and indicating which important items are in which boxes (as well as how many boxes there are). You can also use color-coded tape to indicate which room boxes belong in, for example making all boxes for the living room green and all boxes for the kitchen yellow.  You're probably acquainted with the idea of wrapping delicate items in newspaper or bubble wrap. These are both very good practices and you should definitely wrap items which are prone to breaking. However, you should consider also using non traditional items, since sometimes these can be doubled up to save you packing space.  For example, wrap your glasses in pairs of clean socks and your picture frames can be wrapped in towels.  You should also remember to wrap items to support them. Items with holes at the center or long arms should be wrapped to give them support and make them look more like solid objects. This will keep them from getting broken.  Make sure any boxes that do contain delicate items are marked as fragile. This will help you decide how to organize boxes in the truck and keep you from accidentally breaking items.  Look for any place where there is empty space and use it for packing space. This can reduce the overall footprint of your move, saving you money on trucks or containers. Large furniture items are usually the best example of spaces that can be multipurpose.  For example, you can stuff linens in your fridge. Your dresser drawers can filled with rolled up clothes and saran wrapped individually. Since the drawers are best carried in to your new home one at a time anyway, you can use the space so that the dresser space isn't wasted when it's in the truck.  Most importantly, you're going to want to stay focused and motivated. Even the most fastidious packer can move at a snail's pace if they get bored and distracted. Pack with other people, making it a social gathering. If you can't do that, at least put on your favorite movie or an energetic soundtrack. This will help keep you on task.  Start with the most difficult items to pack. This means that by the end, when you're getting tired, you'll be able to knock out the easy items just like that.  Once you’re done packing, load the boxes and items into a truck or other transportation method for getting them to their final destination. Put the tools, like the hand truck, that you got to good use and be sure to strap everything down. You may also want to wrap large items, like bed headboards and dressers, in blankets, in order to keep them from getting scratched by boxes.  ","sort through all of your stuff first. find some boxes. get some tools. set aside items you'll need immediately. separate out really important or valuable items. start organizing. pack delicate items cleverly to keep them from breaking. make good use of space. stay focused and motivated. load it up!

"You will get notified of the lawsuit when the person suing you (the “plaintiff”) serves you with a copy of the complaint. This document will explain how you violated the plaintiff’s personality rights. You should read the document closely to see what the plaintiff has alleged.  The complaint also makes a request for a remedy from the court. The remedy could be money compensation or it could be a legal command (an “injunction”) to stop using the plaintiff’s name or likeness.;  , This document should be served along with the complaint. It tells you how much time you have to respond to the lawsuit.Make note of the deadline and commit to responding in time.  If you don’t respond in time, then the plaintiff could get a “default judgment.” With this judgment, the plaintiff can possibly garnish your wages or put liens on your property. In effect, you lose without getting a chance to defend yourself.  Consent is a complete defense to a claim that you appropriated someone’s likeness.Consent can be written or oral. Hopefully, you have written express consent in the form of a signed release. Go through your papers and look for any writing that might qualify as consent to use someone’s name or likeness.  If you were given oral consent, then write down your memories of the conversation with the plaintiff. Identify any witnesses who might have heard the plaintiff give consent and get witness statements from them as well.  Your best defenses will depend on the circumstances of the case. However, there are common defenses that you can typically raise in this type of lawsuit. In addition to consent, you could argue the following:You were reporting on a newsworthy event. You have a First Amendment right to report or comment on any issue of public interest. This is a very broad right. It applies to traditional print as well as online reporting or commentary. The only real limitation is that the name or likeness must be related in some way to your commentary or reporting. For example, you cannot put Tina Fey’s picture on the cover of a book about dentistry.  You transformed the name or likeness in a creative work. For example, if you created a collage and used the photograph of a celebrity in the art work, you might be able to claim that you have transformed the image.  The plaintiff waited too long to sue. Each state has a “statute of limitations” period, which is the maximum amount of time a person can wait to sue you. The length varies by state, but is often between one and six years. If the plaintiff waited too long, you can get the case dismissed.  To understand how to build your strongest defense, you should schedule a meeting with an attorney. A qualified attorney can tell you what evidence you will need to properly defend against this kind of lawsuit.  You can get referrals in several ways. For example, you can ask another attorney for a recommendation. You might have used an attorney to buy real estate or to draft a will. Ask this person whether they could recommend an attorney who you can meet with to discuss this lawsuit.  You can also contact your local or state bar association, which should run a referral program.Once you have the name of an attorney, you should call and schedule a consultation. Take your copy of the complaint and summons, as well as other helpful documents. Show them to the attorney.  He or she can handle all aspects of the lawsuit, from drafting your response to the complaint, to doing everything at trial. Ask the attorney about his or her fees. Also get an estimate for how much the entire defense would cost you.  If you can’t afford to hire the attorney to do everything, then ask if he or she offers “limited scope representation.” Under this arrangement, the attorney only does the work you give them. For example, you could have the attorney coach you throughout the lawsuit or draft specific court documents. You would then handle the rest of the defense yourself.Most states allow attorneys to offer limited scope representation. Ask at the consultation if this is an option.  You respond to the complaint by filing an “answer.” If you have a lawyer, then he or she will draft the answer for you. If you don’t have a lawyer, then you need to draft your own. Often, courts will have printed answer forms. You fill in the requested information and then file the answer.Ask the court clerk if there is a form available.  In the answer, respond to each allegation made by the plaintiff. You can admit, deny, or claim insufficient knowledge.If part of an allegation is true, then state which part is true and which part you deny.  You can also raise any affirmative defenses in your answer. For example, you can claim the plaintiff violated the statute of limitations.  Make several copies. Take the original and the copies to the court clerk and ask to the file the original.The clerk should stamp your copies with the filing date.  You may have to pay a fee to file your answer. Call the clerk ahead of time to ask about the amount and acceptable methods of payment.  Once you have filed the original, you need to send the plaintiff a copy of your answer. You can generally make service in the following ways:  You can hire a private process server to make hand delivery on the plaintiff. The plaintiff’s address should be listed on the complaint. If the plaintiff has a lawyer, then make delivery on the lawyer.Typically, you can have someone 18 or older hand deliver the answer if this person is not a party to the lawsuit.  In some courts, you can also mail a copy of the complaint. Ask your court clerk for acceptable methods of service.  After you file your answer, both you and the plaintiff can request helpful information in “discovery.” This is the fact-finding part of the lawsuit, and it can last a long time. You can request helpful information using different discovery techniques:  Request copies of relevant documents. For example, you can request that the plaintiff turn over any evidence that they have suffered financially because of your appropriation of their name or likeness.  Serve “interrogatories” on the plaintiff. These are written questions the plaintiff must answer under oath. You can use interrogatories to get basic information, such as the names of anyone who has information about the lawsuit.  A deposition is another helpful discovery technique. The plaintiff will answer questions face-to-face in a lawyer’s office, with a court reporter recording the questions and answers.You definitely want to ask the plaintiff questions in a deposition.  In particular, you should try to get the plaintiff to admit to consenting to the use of his or her name or likeness. At trial, you can ask the plaintiff about any questions he or she made in a deposition.  You can win the lawsuit without going to trial if you file and win a motion for summary judgment. With this motion, you argue that there are no meaningful (“material”) facts in dispute for a jury to decide. Because no facts are in dispute, the judge should decide the case in your favor based on the law.You could have a very strong argument. For example, you might have used the plaintiff’s picture to illustrate a magazine story. The story could be about waitresses and the plaintiff is a waitress. In this situation, the judge might feel comfortable granting you summary judgment.  In other situations, the judge might deny the motion. For example, you might argue that the plaintiff gave oral consent to your use of her likeness. The plaintiff denies she gave oral consent. This is the kind of disputed material fact that a jury will have to decide after listening to trial testimony.  You can also avoid a trial by settling the dispute outside of court. For example, you could negotiate a settlement or participate in mediation. Both are voluntary. If you come to an agreement, you can pay the plaintiff some money, and the plaintiff will agree to withdraw the lawsuit.  Talk to your lawyer about whether you should settle. You will probably have to pay money, so you might not want to settle if you think you have a very strong defense at trial. However, you also need to consider the benefit of making the lawsuit go away quickly, which a settlement can accomplish.  Mediation is a good option if you don’t have a lawyer. With mediation, you and the plaintiff meet with a third person, the mediator, who listens to each side describe the dispute. Mediation will cost between $70-400 an hour, which you can split evenly with the plaintiff., If you hired a lawyer, then he or she can get everything pulled together as your trial date approaches. However, if you are representing yourself, then you will need to get organized.  Create a list of witnesses. The judge will give you a deadline for giving a list of your witnesses to the plaintiff. You should identify people who have helpful information. Remember that a witness can only testify as to what he or she personally knows.For example, you could call as a witness someone who overheard the plaintiff give you oral consent. However, a witness can’t testify to gossip.  Serve subpoenas on your witnesses. A subpoena is a legal command for the witness to show up at court on a certain day and time to testify.You should serve all of your witnesses with subpoenas. Ask the court clerk where you can get a blank subpoena form and how you can serve the subpoena on your witnesses.  Make exhibits. Any document you want to introduce at trial has to be an exhibit. You can create an exhibit by attaching an exhibit sticker to the document. Put the sticker either in the corner or on the back. You can get exhibit stickers from an office supply store or from the court clerk.You will need to make several copies of your exhibits for trial.  To get familiar with court procedure, you should also sit in on a trial. Courtrooms are usually open to the public. You can ask the court clerk if there are any trials that you can watch.  Pay attention to where people sit and where they stand when they talk to the judge or to witnesses.  Also take a notepad and write down the questions that lawyers ask witnesses. If you are representing yourself at trial, then you will need to ask witnesses questions. You want to appear as professional as possible.  You don’t want to be late to your trial, so give yourself plenty of time to get to the courthouse and go through security. Make sure to turn off your cell phones and other electronic devices before entering court. Some courts might not even let you bring them inside., You will have to pick a jury first (if either you or the plaintiff requested a jury). This process is called “voir dire.”It may differ slightly depending on the court, but the process is generally the same.  A group of potential jurors will be sent to the court room. The judge will then ask them basic questions, such as whether they know you or the plaintiff, if they can be fair, their jobs, etc.  A potential juror will be seated on the jury unless you or the plaintiff request their removal. If you think the potential juror can’t be fair, then ask the judge to excuse the juror “for cause.”  You also will get a limited number of “peremptory challenges.” You can use these challenges to remove a juror without getting the judge’s permission. You can use a peremptory challenge for any reason other than discriminating on the basis of sex, race, or ethnicity.If a potential juror is not removed for cause or with a peremptory challenge, then he or she will be seated on the jury.  The trial starts with opening statements, and the plaintiff goes first. Your goal with the opening statement should be to give the jury a sneak peek of what the evidence will be.  Make your opening statement as short as possible. You don’t want to bore the jury.  Mention what witnesses will testify and what they will testify to.  Now is not the time to argue that the evidence shows you should win the lawsuit. Instead, be objective and stick to facts. Say, “As the evidence will show…” and then briefly explain what the witness will testify to., The plaintiff will present witnesses first. Their case will vary depending on the circumstances, but you should expect them to present examples of your appropriation of their name or likeness. The plaintiff should also testify that they did not give you consent to appropriate their identity.  You get to cross-examine all plaintiff witnesses, including the plaintiff. See Question Witnesses when Representing Yourself for tips.  You will probably have to testify as well. You should prepare with your lawyer, who will ask you questions. If you don’t have a lawyer, then the judge will decide how you can present your testimony. For example, the judge might let you give a speech or ask yourself questions and then answer them.  Be sure to speak clearly so that the jury can hear you. When a lawyer asks a question, look at the lawyer, but remember to make eye contact with jurors when you answer.  Always stay calm when you are cross-examined. You will lose credibility if you get rattled.  Remember to answer questions using whole words, not gestures or sounds like “uh huh” or “hmmmm….”Ask the lawyer to repeat or rephrase a question if you didn’t understand it.  Your purpose is to tie all of the evidence together and show the jury how it favors your interpretation.The plaintiff has the burden of proving that it is more likely than not that you used their identity without permission. Be sure to poke as many holes in the plaintiff’s case as possible.  The judge will read the jury its instructions after closing arguments have been made. The jury then retires to deliberate. If you have no jury, then the judge should give the verdict from the bench.  In many state courts, verdicts no longer need to be unanimous.Instead, the plaintiff could win if nine or 10 out of 12 jurors decide against you.  An appeal is a request that a higher court review the trial proceedings. The appellate court will typically have three judges. You point out errors the judge made or that there was no evidence to support the jury’s verdict. If you win the appeal, then the appellate court may order a new trial.Talk with your lawyer about whether an appeal would be worthwhile. They can take up to a year to resolve. Also, if you win the appeal, then you might have to go through the trial process a second time. You might find it easier just to pay the plaintiff rather than go through another trial.  You start the appeal process by filing a Notice of Appeal with the trial court. You don’t have much time—typically 30 days or less.  ","read the complaint. read the summons. get proof of any consent. analyze your defenses. meet with an attorney. think about hiring the attorney. get an answer form from the court clerk. complete the answer form. file the answer. send the plaintiff a copy of your answer. request helpful information from the plaintiff. have the plaintiff sit for a deposition. file a motion for summary judgment. think about settling. organize your evidence for trial. observe a trial. arrive early. pick a jury. make an opening statement. cross-examine the plaintiff’s witnesses. testify on your own behalf. deliver a closing argument. await the verdict. think about appealing, if you lose.

"They need to be free of any leftover food and dry to avoid bacterial or mold growth.;  , The size of the jars makes them ideal to store such items as buttons, sequins, beads and other sewing baubles.  Add nuts, bolts, screws, nails, washers and other small hardware items to the jars. If you're handy with wood, screw the lids into a piece of wood and mount the wood as a shelf. The jars simply screw or pop back into the lids and create a tidy storage space.  Fill the jars with potpourri of choice. Cover the top of the jar with lace or other wide weave cloth to allow the scent to waft out. Finish up with a sweet ribbon bow tied around the jar to hold down the lace or other fabric.  The jars are great for taking small amounts of food such as jam, pickles, sauce etc. along to a picnic or tailgate event instead of having to take along the entire large jar such items come in originally. Obviously, don't use the jars for storage of such items after the picnic; what has not been eaten should be discarded after the picnic.  The jars are excellent for taking salad dressing to a picnic or work. For example, mix olive oil and balsamic vinegar together and pour into the jar as a quick dressing.  Pour sand into the base of the baby food jar, then add the tea light candle in the center. These work well indoors and out and throw a pretty glow.  Add citronella candles for outdoor use to repel insects around entertaining areas.  Sew the cushion part onto the lid and stuff well. Inside the jar, keep additional pins.  Large amounts of dried herbs can be easily and comfortably kept in baby jars.  Place the jar next to the change table for ease of use.  Fill with soil and add seeds that will be transplanted quickly. Given that there are no drainage holes, this usage should be very short term.  Fill with different layers of sand and other interesting layers such as glitter and glue the lid into place. Decorate the lid and give away as gifts or use at home.  The jars are a good size for holding paint and for putting paintbrushes into.  This is a neat way of carrying a small amount of treats or a pick-me-up snack for your pet.  ","wash and dry out the baby food jars before any use. use the baby food jars to store small sewing items. store small hardware supplies in the baby food jars. make potpourri jars. store condiments and other small food items in them for a picnic. turn the jar into a candle holder. create a pincushion with pin holder. keep dried herbs and spices in the jar. keep diaper pins in the jar. grow seedlings in the jars. turn the jars into paperweights. use the jars to hold paint for finger painting and other projects. carry pet kibble, treats or biscuits in a jar when visiting people or going for a drive, etc. "
"Hold the container upside-down and shake it lightly to loosen the perennial's roots. Gently pull the plant from the container.  Examine the root ball. If many roots are visible, the plant is likely rootbound. To force new growth in a rootbound plant, slice off the bottom 1/2-inch (1.27-cm) of roots using a sharp knife. With your fingers, break up the root ball by separating the roots along the side of the root ball. If you don't break up a rootbound plant, the roots may continue a circular growth pattern and stunt the plant's growth.  Using a shovel or garden trowel, dig a hole that is slightly wider and the same depth as the perennial container. If the perennial is planted too deep, the plant will experience stress and may not thrive.  Using a garden trowel or your hands, fill in around the plant with soil. Gently tap down the soil around the plant using your hands. The root ball should be even with or slightly below the surface of the garden soil.  Water immediately after planting. Examine the plant each day for about 2 weeks while the roots become established. Make sure the soil around the plant is moist and that the perennial isn't wilting. Most perennials need daily watering during the first week, and every other day during the second week. Perennials planted during the summer may require more frequent watering.  ","remove the perennial from the growing container. dig a hole for the perennial. place the perennial in the hole. water the perennial thoroughly. "
"If you get a written warning at school, you’ve most likely broken a rule that is part of your school code. There should be a school handbook available to you so that you can see the exact rule that they’ve accused you of breaking.  Now is the time to make your parents aware of what happened. Rather than waiting until you get into more trouble, let them know your side of the story and show them the warning. They can choose to be included in your future meetings about the warning if they wish.  Chances are if you have a written warning, either the school counselor or your teacher will expect you to have a meeting about it. This should follow within the same week of your written warning. In the meeting, you should discuss what happened, why it happened, and the consequences.  If you feel you were wrongly accused, calmly ask for a meeting with a member of the school board to discuss it. If your counselor or teacher doesn’t think this is necessary, ask them if they can revoke the warning., After your original meeting, you should set up a follow-up meeting to discuss the improvement of your behavior. This will help you stay focused on behaving, and will show them that you’re not planning on acting out again.  ","receive your warning. make your parents aware. set up a meeting. schedule up a follow-up meeting. "
"If you want to preserve your friendship with this person, resist acting out on your emotions. Rejection can make you feel angry, embarrassed, and just plain hurt. Don’t react on impulse and take these feelings out on the other person.  Before saying anything more to the person, immediately take a few breaths to collect yourself. Don’t rush into making any decisions. Give yourself time to calm down first.;  , Being around the person may be especially difficult after saying the “L” word. Ask for some space to deal with your feelings. You guys can discuss how you want to move forward later. But, right now, it’s not going to do you any good to have to pretend and keep spending time with them.Say something like, “I need some time to come to terms with your reaction. I want to hang out again, but can you give me a few days?”  , It’s second-nature after a rejection to feel defeated. Counteract this by pouring on the love. Treat yourself gently, like you would a friend who’s got the flu. Treat yourself to a special lunch or dinner. Binge-watch your favorite TV show. Work off some steam in the gym. Do things that help you feel better.You may be tempted to reach for numbing substances like alcohol and drugs. These won’t make you feel any better. Instead, take good care of yourself by eating balanced meals, exercising, and getting enough sleep.  Journal to unload your feelings about the rejection. You might describe what happened, how the person responded, and how it made you feel. Journaling is a great tool to help you identify your emotions and learn to cope with them., Share your feelings with a close friend. Make sure you choose someone you can trust, who won’t spread the information around town. They might even be able to offer you helpful advice, or comfort you after the rejection.You might say, “Wendy, I’m humiliated. I told Greg I loved him. He told me he doesn’t look at me that way. I don’t know what to do.”  , Another way to cope with rejection is to change how you look at it. You may be viewing the situation as if there’s something wrong with you. Change this thought process by coming up with some realistic alternatives.For example, the person may have said “no” because they want to keep you as a friend—they don’t want to risk losing you if a relationship doesn’t work out.  Another way to look at it is the person rejected you because there’s someone else out there who’s a better match for you. You just have to wait to meet them.  Remind yourself that it takes a lot of courage to step up and declare your feelings. Admire that trait about yourself!  ","pause before reacting negatively. get some space from the person. nurse your wounds with self-care. journal about your feelings. confide in someone you trust. reframe how you look at rejection. "

"Invisalign fits snugly to the shape of your teeth; ideally there should be no gap between your teeth and invisalign. Cleaning your teeth prior to inserting invisalign ensures that no food particle is caught in your mouth that could change the contour of the invisalign fit. It also guarantees that no bacteria is caught underneath the invisalign tray, which could erode your teeth and cause increased dental bills during your treatment., If you have not work your aligner tray in a while, your teeth might have shifted back. It might be difficult to insert the entire tray into your mouth, so try this method of inserting one side at a time.  Find the easiest point of insertion. Depending on which teeth have the most alignment problems (e.g., crowding, rotation, etc.), the tray might be easier to insert on one side of your mouth versus the other. If you know the side of your mouth (either the right side, left side, or center of the arch) that requires the most adjustment, insert the tray on the opposite side: the tray will fit the best on the side that requires the least amount of adjustment. If you are unsure, try trial and error: try inserting the tray on either side, and go with the side that causes the least amount of discomfort.The tray is quite flexible and it is not that easy to break it, so don't get scared to press the tray a little bit on your teeth.  Insert invisalign on the other side of your mouth. Once you have inserted the tray on the side of your mouth that has the least amount of discomfort, slide the tray on to the other side.  This allows an uninterrupted period for your aligners to settle in, which makes it easier to get them in and out during the day.  Put the aligner tray in in front of a mirror, which will allow you to visualize the prior insertion. This is especially important if you are trying to fit the tray over malpositioned teeth that may stick out in the arch., If you have difficulty inserting the aligner tray or are experiencing a lot of pain, stop trying and call your dentist: you could do damage to your teeth or to the aligner tray, or both.Invisalign should be a relatively seamless fit; a lot of difficulty or pain is a sign that something is the matter. Most likely the doctor will need to adjust the fit, or you might need to go down to another tray size, which is usually kept by your dentist., If you have not worn invisalign for a while, your teeth might have shifted back to a previous stage in treatment, or even back to the beginning before treatment began. If you have trouble inserting a specific aligner tray, try a previous tray (for example, #7 instead of #8). Continue to wear this smaller size and see your dentist as soon as possible.If it has been a long time since you have worn your aligner tray, it might be necessary to do a “refinement” – which requires getting new impressions and getting a new series of aligners, but this can be expensive.  ","thoroughly clean your teeth. use the side to side method of insertion. change your aligner trays at night before bed. use a mirror. don’t force it. try another tray size. "
"If you live in or near a large U.S. city, look it up on the Environmental Working Group database. Otherwise, you may need to contact your water utility and ask for a water quality report, or ask a local environmental group focused on water issues.  Once you know the specific chemicals you are trying to filter out, you can read the packaging or online descriptions of water filter products to see whether they are removed. Alternatively, use the EWG filter selection search, or narrow down your options using these tips:Charcoal (or 'carbon') filters are cheap and widely available. They will filter out most organic contaminants, including lead, mercury, and asbestos.  Reverse osmosis filters remove inorganic contaminants such as arsenic and nitrates. They are extremely water-inefficient, so use only if you know the water is contaminated with a chemical carbon does not filter out.  De-ionizing filters (or ion exchange filters) remove minerals, turning hard water into soft water. They do not remove contaminants.  There are many types of water filters on the market, designed to accommodate a variety of needs. Here are the most common options for home use:A pitcher water filter. These are convenient for households with low water use, as you can fill the pitcher once or twice a day and keep it cool in the refrigerator.  A faucet-mounted filter is convenient if you want to filter all your tap water, but can slow down flow rate.  On-counter or under-sink water filters required plumbing modifications, but generally use longer-lasting filters, and thus require less maintenance.  Install a whole-house water filter if your water is severely contaminated and unsafe even for bathing.  Each filter should come with a set of instructions showing you how to set it up so that it works correctly. In most cases assembly is quite simple, but if you have trouble putting it together, call the manufacturer for help.  Take cold water and pass it through the filter. In most cases the water is poured into the top of the filter; it then makes its way down through the filter mechanism, where impurities are removed. The clean water streams into the bottom of the bottle or pitcher, or out of the bottom of the faucet, depending on what type of filter you have.  Do not submerge the filter while running water through it. Water that backs up into the filter may not be purified.  Some filters are damaged by hot water; check the manufacturer's instructions.  After a few months of use, a carbon water filter becomes clogged and stops working as well to purify water. Buy a new filter cartridge from the same manufacturer that made the water filter. Remove the old cartridge and discard it, then replace it with the new one.  Some water filters last longer than others. Check the instructions that came with your product for a more detailed time frame, or contact the manufacturer.  ","find out which contaminants are in your water. choose a type of filter. select an installation type. set up the filter according to the manufacturer's instructions. run water through the filter. change the filter cartridge as recommended.

"To construct this hygrometer, you will need two thermometers, some cotton gauze, a rubber band, a small container some water, and a piece of cardboard large enough to hang the two thermometers.  Moisten the gauze with some water and wrap it around the bulb (bottom tip) of the thermometer. Secure the gauze in place with the rubber band. In order for this hygrometer to work long term the gauze must stay moist during readings.  Fill the small container with water and make sure part of the gauze is in contact with the water. The gauze will stay wet as long as it is touching the water in the container.  Align the thermometers so that their tops and bottoms are in the same place. Secure them in place using tape or hot glue. Use caution when working with hot glue.  This hygrometer allows you to determine a relative humidity level of the air.Look at each thermometer at eye level and record the degree at which the red liquid sits. Write down these temperatures.  Make multiple recordings throughout the day and take note of the weather as well. Is it sunny? Is it raining?  , Obtain a wet/dry humidity table like the one found here. The left side of the table (y-axis) is the temperature reading of the dry thermometer. The horizontal (x-axis) of the table is the difference between the dry thermometer and the wet thermometer.  Subtract the dry thermometer temperature from the wet thermometer (wet – dry = difference).  Find the temperature of the dry bulb on the vertical axis and then find the corresponding difference on the horizontal axis. Where those two meet on the graph tells you the relative humidity.  Be sure that your table matches the scale you are using. If you’re using Fahrenheit, use a Fahrenheit table. If you’re measuring in Celsius, use a Celsius table.

"If you decide to simply present the original artwork as a gift, feel free to use any size paper (or, if using paint, a literal canvas) that you like. However, for many of these projects, you’ll be scanning the finished artwork to your computer. If you decide on one of these, use paper that will fit your scanner. Also:  Be aware that changing the size of your scanned image may alter the image itself. For example, shrinking your child’s 8.5 x 11-inch self-portrait to fit a small canvas pouch may cause facial features to condense and blur together. Conversely, blowing up a smaller picture to cover a larger dishtowel may cause the blown-up image to appear pixelated.  To avoid this, use paper that roughly matches the surface area of the item that it will be transferred to. Or, simply trim larger sheets of paper down to size with scissors.;  , Again, if you intend to give the original artwork as a gift, this is less of a concern. However, for artwork that needs to be scanned and transferred, consider the dimensions of the item that it will be transferred to. If the item is wider than it is long, instruct your kids to orient their paper accordingly.  For example, if you’re going to iron your transfer onto a small wide pouch, you’ll most likely want a horizontal image to cover as much surface area as possible.  Of course, if you want to, give your kids free rein to draw or paint whatever they choose. But also consider instructing them to draw appropriate subjects for the occasion. Ask them to create a custom image that ties directly into the occasion and/or the recipient for a more personalized gift. For example:  If the occasion is a birthday, they could draw a party scene with cake and balloons.  For holidays like Christmas or Hannukah, have them draw a Christmas tree or a menorah.  For relatives like grandparents, aunts, and uncles, ask each child to draw a family portrait, or make it a group project with each family member drawing themselves.  If you’ll be giving the finished artwork as a gift by itself, skip this step. However, if you’re going to use it to decorate another item (or present copies of one image to more than one recipient), scan the artwork to your computer. Once scanned, crop, minimize, or otherwise edit the image to your liking and save the file.  If you don’t have a scanner, you can either use a smartphone or digital camera to take photos instead.Or, bring the artwork to a copy store to have it scanned and saved to a thumbdrive.  ","determine how big your canvas should be. decide between wide and long. pick your subjects. scan your artwork. "

"Since very few oxygen systems work the same way, typically your doctor or medical supplies provider will show you how to work your specific system. You may even be able to have your medical supplier help you set up your system in-home so that you don't have to do it on your own., Oxygen can facilitate combustion, so it is important to avoid open flames and easily flammable materials such as petroleum while using supplemental oxygen. Avoid the use of matches, lighters, candles, cigarettes, and other flammable products in your home.You may choose to place “no smoking” and “no open flame” signs around your house to help remind both you and your guests that you should not use an open flame in a house with supplemental oxygen.  Lotions and creams that use petroleum are more likely to ignite in the presence of pure oxygen. Opt for water-based products instead to help keep you safe., While other heat sources that do not use an open flame can be used in an environment with supplemental oxygen, they should be used with caution. At least five feet of distance is recommended between the oxygen source and the heat source., Your tank or concentrator should be stored upright in an area where it will not be an obstruction, such as areas where people typically walk through a room. Use a secure cart or stand to help you store your tank upright. Do not allow a tank to stand or lean in an upright position, as the tank will be easier to knock over, which could harm you or your home. Do not store your oxygen near heat sources or in a confined, unventilated area such as a closet. Store extra tanks by placing them flat on the floor in an area where others are unlikely to run into them, such as your garage or in a spare bedroom.  If your tank does fall, it is likely still usable. Check for dents or a hissing noise that may indicate damage to the tank. If none are found, return the tank to an upright position and continue use.  Most portable tanks and concentrators can come with you in your car when you travel. You can even use the seat belt to help hold it in place. They should still be stored upright and secured in the vehicle. Avoid leaving your oxygen in a hot car, and do not smoke in your vehicle while transporting oxygen.

"The flesh should be a translucent, white and shiny. It should spring back when you press it. Avoid steaks that look mottled, discolored, or dull.  Halibut is naturally low in fat, so it can dry out quickly during the cooking process. To prevent this, brush both sides with oil or melted butter before cooking halibut. You can also marinate the fish in oil or a flavored prepared marinade for a few hours before you cook it.  Only turn the fish when it is halfway done. This will help keep it from breaking apart and will help ensure even cooking throughout the fillet. Turn the halibut over using a wide spatula or turner to make sure you flip the whole fillet.  The flavor of halibut is delicate and light, so it's important to avoid over-seasoning the fish and losing its natural flavor. Avoid heavy spices or thick sauces. Instead, choose a light sauce or marinade to complement the flavor of the fish.  ","choose halibut steaks that are fresh in appearance. keep the fish moist. limit how much you handle the fish. season in moderation. "
"Some employers might try to discuss salary at the start of the interview. If possible, you should delay any discussion of salary until you’ve made your case for why you should be hired. Deflect by saying something like, “Let’s talk numbers later. I need to hear more about the job first.”Of course, you might have had to put a salary down on your application. Remember that the number you proposed is simply a starting point for discussion. Based on what you learn about the job, you can increase the amount you ask for.;  , You can’t really discuss salary until you understand in detail the job requirements. Often, employers publish job descriptions that are vague or confusing. Accordingly, use the interview to figure out exactly what the employer wants you to do in the job.  Request a job description and spend several minutes looking it over.Make sure the responsibilities align with your expectations.  Based on the interview, you might realize that your proposed salary is much too low. For example, the job might be more complex than you had anticipated. In that situation, you'll need to adjust your salary expectations.  Ideally, delay negotiations until you know you have the job. This will put you in the strongest bargaining position. Be sure to ask, “Are you offering me the job?”  Often, it won't be possible to have a job offer in hand before negotiating. If the employer is on a very tight budget, they might try to lock you into a salary range before even offering you the job.  Not every employer is willing to negotiate salary, so ask. If they say “no,” then you can move on to negotiate fringe benefits, which can increase your overall compensation.Depending on your job, you might also negotiate a signing bonus, performance bonus, or commission. For example, sales people are often compensated in these ways.  Your current salary might be the starting point for discussion. You can expect the employer to ask something like, “So how much do you make in your current position?” You must always answer honestly, but you can offer an approximation: 'I make mid-thirties.'  If you lie, you’ll destroy your credibility. An employer can do a little research to find out what you currently make.  If your current salary is low, you can explain why. For example, “I only make $24,000, but that’s because I needed to get my foot in the door somewhere. Since starting a year ago, I’ve taken on high-level work to gain experience, so I think I’m underpaid right now.”If your current salary is higher than what the new job can offer, you need to explain why you are seeking to switch.  When negotiating, some employers might want you to throw out the first number. This can work to your advantage. Research has shown that the first number serves as an “anchor” for the negotiation, and that it is difficult to negotiate away from the anchor.Accordingly, you should state the high end of your salary range.  Experts recommend using a precise number, such as $38,550 instead of $39,000. By using a precise number, the person on the other side will assume that you have done considerable research.However, sometimes it’s better not to throw out the first number, especially if you don’t have sufficient information. For example, the employer might not have shared a job description with you. In that situation, you can say, “You have a better idea of your compensation policy. What’s a fair salary?”  , If the employer comes in low with their counter-offer, you should reject it and make your own counter-offer. However, you also need to give reasons justifying why.  For example, you can say, “I’m sorry, that’s a little low. I think based on my twelve years of experience in the field, I’m worth more.”  If the employer proposed the first number, ask why. For example, you could say, “That sounds a little low. Can I see a job description? I might not understand what you are looking for.”  Only move down from your first number in $500-1,000 increments. If your first number is $40,000 and the employer offers $35,000, don’t move immediately to $37,500. Instead, propose $39,000.  Fringe benefits such as health insurance and a company retirement plan can increase your overall compensation substantially. Accordingly, you might want to focus on negotiating fringe benefits if the employer cannot meet your salary expectations.Also negotiate non-cash benefits, such as flexible time to work from home or more personal/vacation days.  You shouldn’t immediately accept a salary offer, even if you are generally pleased with it. Instead, ask for a few days to think it over, which will make you appear thoughtful.Simply say, “Thanks for the offer. Can I have a few days to think this over?”  Don’t say, “I need to talk to my spouse.” This will make you appear indecisive.  After you accept, ask for the offer and starting salary in writing.An employer should have no problem giving you a letter laying out when you’ll start and the salary.  Never rely on verbal promises, since they are easy to break. You’ll have no tangible proof that there was even a job offer.  There are many online salary calculators you can use to find the market rate for the job you are seeking. Remember to find the market salary for your city or state. Salaries differ significantly depending on where you live, so you want the market rate for the area where the job is located. The following salary calculators are helpful:glassdoor.com  indeed.com  salary.com  payscale.com  , Governments make their salary data public, so you can also search there.Find an equivalent job in a university or city/state government. You might not be able to find an exact match, but you can look for a job that is similar.  For example, you might be interviewing in a small town to be a case manager. You can’t find salary information, but you see that a nearby community college pays project managers about $30,000. You can use this as a rough estimate for determining the market rate.  Some professional organizations distribute salary surveys to businesses in their industry.This data can be very helpful when deciding how much to ask for a salary. Research professional organizations and check whether they have any recent survey data.  Some survey data is posted online. However, other data might be kept private and shared only with members of the professional organization.  Find other people who currently work in the job you are interviewing for. You can schedule a lunch or meet with them at a professional organization. Although you might be embarrassed to ask how much they make, you can ask in a roundabout way.  For example, you can discuss the market rate based on your research and ask, “Does that sound about right?”, The market rate is just an average, and you can ask for more if you have more education than the position requires. However, if you have less, then you might need to accept a salary on the lower end of the market rate.Also consider any credentials you have. For example, you might have earned a certification which is recognized in your industry.  The more experience you have, the more efficiently you can do a job, which should result in a higher salary.Look at the market rate and then increase or decrease it based on your experience.  Make sure your experience is relevant. If you worked six years as a paralegal, that’s not relevant experience when you negotiate a salary as an attorney.  Some salary calculators will ask for how many years experience you have.  It’s better to have a range in mind than a single number.The range should include the bare minimum you are willing to work for, as well as the most you think you can get. The midpoint should be what you think you are worth based on your research.  For example, you might be an experienced administrative assistant interviewing for a job in Buffalo, New York. Based on your research, you see the average salary is $13.65, which works out to around $28,000 a year.Because you have 10 years’ experience, you might ask for $32,000-$35,000.  In this example, $32,000 is the minimum you’ll take. If the employer can’t offer even that amount, you’ll walk unless the fringe benefits are outstanding.

"U.S. citizens, and non-citizens authorized to work in the U.S., are eligible to receive a Social Security Number or a replacement card if they lose the first one.This is the most common identification number used to file individual tax returns.  On Form 1040—the form most individuals use to file their income taxes—the default TIN is the filer's SSN, and there is a designated space for this number in the upper-right corner of the first page of the form.Thus, if you are filing as an individual and already have a SSN, you will not need a separate TIN, and should simply use your SSN when filing taxes.;  , In most cases, you will need at least two documents that prove your identity ,such as a driver's license or state-issued identification card. If you are applying as a US citizen, one of these must be a US birth certificate or US passport.To check your exact requirements, visit the Social Security requirements page and select the buttons on the left that describe your individual situation.

"Spies can't be seen, but they can be heard. Watch the kill/death list on the top right and listen to any screams from a teammate. If one screams out loud, quickly turn around and check to see if it's a Spy who backstabbed. The prime targets for a Spy are Engineer, Sniper, Heavy, Medic and basically anyone who is helping the team advance or defend.;  , Spies have the ability to disguise as a class but the name of the player will always be random. If you notice someone running around with your name, notice you and flee, give chase and start firing. If a teammate is doing something that's suspicious, tail him/her and see what happens. If the person can sap a building, it's a Spy.  As said before, Spies like to play someone else and it's only a matter of time before someone your team mixes up the fake player with the real one. Always try to damage your Medic before going with the flow of the game. Spies can easily trick you and stab you while you're running. Remember, spies can't heal so it's easy to see who is a spy.  A tactic everyone is familiar with, shoot everyone and anyone on your team. If the teammate takes damage, that player may be a Spy. Fire damage is the most popular to exploit for Spy-checking. Another way to Spy check is to play a Scout and run into everyone. Only teammates can phase through teammates, while enemies will run into each other and become roadblocks. Another way is to check the speed. Scouts and Medics are the only fastest classes past the Engineer, Sniper, Pyro and Spy. If you see another Scout that's running at their speed, it's a Spy. If you see a Medic who's running are their speed, it's a Spy. Force-a-Natures also provide a unique Spy check by pushing someone away. Use the two shots in one go and you can kill a Spy. One final way is to use explosive knockback by grenades or rockets.  ","watch and listen. keep an eye on every teammate. check the medic. spy check. "
"These make a great addition to the home by allowing the couple to stock the pantry with the items.;  , Help the young couple start a collection of tools of their own so that they do not have to borrow any from their parents.

"This is the most important step for proper stain removal. The faster you begin cleanup, the better your results will be. Stains left alone for a long time begin to 'set,' becoming harder to remove.If a stain has dried and set in a valuable or irreplaceable item, restoration is still possible! However, the methods are fairly complicated and possibly dangerous to the inexperienced. If the methods outlined here are not enough, consult a professional archivist.;  , Is your item salvageable? Stain removal is typically reserved for relatively small areas of discoloration. You can clean a splash of tea, but nothing can be realistically done for a paperback soaked by a whole pot.  Before you do anything, keep in mind the type of substance on the paper. The type of stain will determine your method of cleanup. This article explains how to take care of the three most common stains:  Water-based stains: This group is probably the most likely. It includes most types of beverages, including coffee, tea, and soda. These liquids act as a sort of dye, leaving pigment behind as a stain once dried.  Oil or grease stains: As their name suggests, these are stains caused by oils, such as those used in cooking. These stains are generally more difficult to remove than water based stains, as grease leaves behind oily clear spots in paper.  Blood stains: Whether from a paper cut or a nose bleed, blood can often find its way onto a book. While blood is technically water based, special consideration during cleanup must be made to prevent a permanent yellow stain.

"Being a plant native to South Africa, tritoma does the best in hot environments. Planting the seeds in May or June allows them just enough time to develop before the temperatures elevate. Then, they will begin to bloom in the hottest months of the summer., If you choose to grow your tritoma inside, then make sure to keep the temperature set in the 70-75 degree Fahrenheit range. Peat pots are a particularly good planting container as they will provide both structure and nutrients.If you don’t have a peat pot available, almost any container will do. It just needs to be clean and have a depth of at least 3 inches to give plenty of room for root growth.  If you decide to grow indoors and then transplant outside, it will take about 7-8 weeks before the plants are ready to move. Make sure to transplant only after the final frost of the season to give the seedlings some time to get established. By this time your seedlings will stand around 2 inches tall.You can also tell that the seedlings are ready to move by looking at their leaves. They should have at least four full leaves.  To transplant, grasp the seedling by the leaves, as the stem is too fragile. Use a spoon to loosen up the soil around the base. Apply a bit of pressure and lift the seedling and its roots out of the soil., This depth will provide protection from the elements, but it is also just deep enough for the seeds to still make it to the surface. Rhizomes, sprouts, or divided bulbs can be placed just slightly deeper at 7 cm because they are a bit hardier., Since tritoma can grow to be rather tall, it will need plenty of air circulation around it without being overshadowed by other plants. Ideally, try to plant each tritoma at least 20 inches apart. If the plants seem to grow closer together you can always thin them out later, too.Providing plenty of room for air circulation will lessen the possibility of your tritoma getting “damping off,” a fungus that breaks down the plant at the soil line., To keep your planting areas looking alive and active, place your tritomas alongside other plants that flower in the late summer months. Marigolds, in particular, work well with tritomas as they are low to the ground and easy to care for. The colors are also complementary with the red of the tritomas playing off of the orange and yellows in the marigolds.  ","plant in the early summer. start with indoor pots. transplant the seedlings at 2 inches. put the seeds at least 6mm deep. leave at least 20 inches between plants. pair them with other late-summer foliage.

"Ideas for how to do this include downsizing your dishes, eating without watching TV or being otherwise distracted, and keeping unhealthy food out of sight. An important component of the DASH diet is also to eat smaller portions more frequently throughout the day. This is a way to reduce the risk of overeating and to distribute your energy evenly during the day.  The DASH diet is not for everyone. However, even if you do not subscribe to the entire DASH diet, you can still use portion control as a weight-loss mechanism.  Regular exercise reduces your risk for a number of diseases, including cardiovascular disease, and is a great way to keep your weight down., Alcohol is high in calories, with some mixed drinks containing as many calories as a meal, and can contribute to weight gain., Keeping to a regular sleep schedule and sleeping about 8 hours a day has been proven to help maintain a lower percentage of body fat and promotes overall good health., If you notice that you are unable to lose weight, consult with your doctor and ask for a referral to see a registered dietitian.

"Nasal congestion has a host of potential causes, and you won't get good treatment without honest answers. Some potential questions your doctor will ask include:  Amount of time congested. If longer than seven days, see a doctor immediately.  Color of mucus  Other symptoms, including aches, fever, coughing, etc.  Any known allergies.  Whether or not you smoke., Most nasal congestion is a symptom of a cold or other infection. Accordingly, most doctors will start with drugs to fight the infection off.  Be sure to tell the doctor if you take any other drugs or medication regularly.  It sounds uncomfortable, but topical anesthetic makes it pain-free and easy. A thin camera is snaked into your sinus to look for polyps, septum deviations, or infections. If your symptoms persists, expect this to be the doctor's first move after drugs.  The alternative, a radiologic (x-ray) study, is both expensive and impractical, but may be needed for extreme or difficult cases.  This easy, 15-minute procedure uses heat to open up your sinuses and clear blockage. You will be put under local anesthetic and will likely be out the door within an hour.  While you will have hot needles in both nostrils, most patients hardly feel a thing.  There will be congestion for the first 1-2 weeks as you heal.  If the procedure does not work, it can be repeated several weeks later.  This is usually performed by an ENT doctor in their office, not at the hospital., If you have a major infection or blockage, you might need endoscopic sinus surgery. A rigid camera will be placed up your nose, which is used to guide a surgeon trying to remove diseased areas or opening up natural cavities.  Surgery is almost always outpatient. You will return home that day.  Pain is minimal, and you should feel as good as new within a week or less.  Revisions are occasionally necessary, though the success rate is high., Turbinates are the structures in your nose that cause congestion. Using CO2 or KTP lasers, they are shrunk down within 20 minutes. There is no packing needed and you can return to work the same day.  You may have light congestion for a week before everything clears up.  You will have mild local anesthetic -- no needles needed.  The drawback of LTS is the expense. It may not be offered at all clinics.  ","be ready to answer several basic questions. expect the first line of defense to be antibiotics and prescription drugs. prepare for an endoscopy, when a camera is placed up your nose for diagnosis. ask about somnoplasty to cure some chronic cases of congestion. understand that your doctor will only recommend surgery in extreme cases. ask about laser turbinate surgery (lts) for minimally invasive, extra-quick decongestion.

"Your detergent bottle should have a chart that tells what amount should be used for your wash load. When using a High Efficiency or front loading washing machine with soft water, use the minimum recommended amount of detergent into the washing machine. If you need to add bleach (which is used to whiten clothes), put it in appropriate dispenser. Always handle bleach carefully as it can cause harm to skin, eyes and clothing if it splashes.  Colors are washed in cold water. Whites, under most circumstances, can be washed in warm water without problem. To kill mites, bed linens (especially pillow-cases) need hot water.  When in doubt, go with cold water, as hot water can shrink clothes.

"Carob is generally available in health food stores. It comes in the following forms:  Powder  Carob chips or drops  Bars;  , It might be as simple as your preference for the taste. One of the main reasons for preferring it over chocolate is that a person has allergies or unpleasant reactions to chocolate. Chocolate causes headaches and some other reactions in sensitive persons. In this case, carob can be substituted without the side effects of chocolate. Another reason is simply that carob adds its own taste dimension to food.  Carob does not taste like chocolate, so don't expect miracles. However, carob can be used in some of the ways that we use chocolate (such as coating raisins, almonds etc.) and as explained above, you can use less or no sugar with carob. Here are some possible substitute ideas:  Use the powder instead of cocoa powder;  Use in place of hot chocolate powder (the sweetness and lack of dairy products is good for those with dietary restrictions);  Substitute carob chips for chocolate chips in cookie and ice cream recipes;  Use in a variety of baked goods in place of sugar. It will impart a slight brown colouring, as well as its own flavour but you can make the most of its fifty percent content of natural sugar to avoid added sugar content.  Unlike chocolate, which is very dangerous for dogs, cats, and other pets, carob can be used in their treats without ill effect. Doggy chocs should really be doggy carob drops.

"There are many popular brands and hundreds of different colors to choose from. Semi-permanent dyes can be found in a variety of places, ranging from grocery stores to specialized fashion shops, with the biggest selection at beauty supply stores. Pick the color that’s your favorite, matches your wardrobe best, and/or is most flattering for your eye color and skin tone. Semi-permanent dyes work on all hair colors, but show up brightest on light hair. On very dark hair, though, they will appear as a very subtle sheen.;  , Bleaching hair will make the color turn out brighter on all hair types. If you want intense, bright colors and you have darker hair, you will need to bleach it.Just keep in mind that bleaching may damage your hair.  A patch test is an easy way to check for allergens at home. This step is very important, especially if you have sensitive skin. If you go straight to dyeing your whole head without checking, you may end up with an itchy scalp or permanent hair loss.  Dab a small amount of dye onto a cotton adhesive pad and place it somewhere on your skin that isn’t too sensitive or typically exposed like your upper back.  Leave the patch on for however long you plan on leaving the dye in your hair (usually an hour).  Remove the patch and rinse the dye from your skin.  Wait another 48 hours before dyeing your hair.  Do not use this dye if your skin experiences itching, redness, or swelling. If your skin starts itching while the patch is still on, remove it immediately and scrub away the dye with soap and water., Select a small strand of hair that is not on the surface of your hairdo. Dye this strand following the instructions on the bottle.This step can be skipped if you don’t care about the exact shade of your new hair color. If you’ve never bleached your hair before, you may want to do a strand test with both your bleaching method and then with the dye.  Normally you should avoid using a blow dryer, as it can dry out and damage your hair. However, the drier your hair, the better your dye will soak in. Don’t condition your hair until after the dye has been applied and rinsed out.  While semi-permanent dyes eventually wash out of hair, they can be fairly difficult to remove from other materials like most fabrics. Semi-permanent dye is usually easy to remove from skin with a good scrubbing, but the process may take a few days. It's less work to prevent making a mess than cleaning it up later.  Wear some clothes that you don't mind staining.  Put a towel down on the floor in the area where you’re working.  Wear exam gloves.  Place a thin layer of petroleum jelly on the skin along your hairline.  You can dye all of your hair the same shade or you can get more creative. Here are a few options to consider:  Dye only your highlights. Many people with dark hair go for this look with bright colors.  Dye just the ends. This is called the 'dip dye' look, since it seems like the hair has been dipped in paint. Section off your hair with plastic clips and you can use multiple colors for this method.  Two colors from the same brand can be mixed. You can dye your tips one color, the hair near your roots another, and mix the two in the middle for an “ombré” look.  Try a wild, multi-colored look or make a pattern by keeping certain sections of your hair un-dyed. Put a little conditioner on the parts of your hair that you want protected.  Place a thick amount of hair dye wherever you want it. The best way to do this varies based on your style:  If you’re dyeing a large area or your whole head, the best way to do this is by massaging the dye in by hand. Grab a palm full of dye and work it into your hair as if you were shampooing. If your hair is long, you will need to do this a few times with more dye to spread the color evenly throughout. You can also try dyeing thicker hair in sections.  If you’re dyeing a smaller section, use a special tools called a tint brushes. Dip the brush into the dye and 'paint' your hair. This will help you to both control where the color goes and make sure all your hair is coated. Go over each section a few times to make sure the dye is even., How long you should leave it in for will vary by brand, but 30 minutes to an hour is typical. Unlike permanent dyes, which contain harsh chemicals that can damage your hair and skin, there is usually no 'too long' with semi-permanent colors.If you want to leave your work area while the dye sets, put your hair in a shower cap to keep from making a mess.  Rinsing in the sink will reduce the chance of dyeing your skin but may be inconvenient. Rinsing in the shower is usually fine, even with dark colors.  Soak your hair thoroughly with running water. This is more important if you've left the dye in so long that it has dried out.  Gently wash your hair with color care shampoo. Keeping your hair moisturized will help maintain the color.  Keep rinsing your hair until the water starts running clear. If you leave any dye in, you will end up staining anything your hair touches.  Apply conditioner. This will also help keep your hair moist.  Allow your hair to air dry. Blow drying will dry out your hair too much and make your new color fade faster.  Semi-permanent dye will fade more each time you wash your hair. To make the color last longer, wash your hair as infrequently as you can get away with. The thicker and less oily your hair, the less often you need to wash it., When you do wash your hair, be sure to use a shampoo that will minimize fade. Most major shampoo brands have at least one color-protecting product. If you have trouble finding one at the drugstore, try checking a specialty beauty supply shop.  Dry hair is more prone to fading. Use conditioner, whether rinse-out or leave-in.If you have very textured, coily type hair, try using shea butter.  The nature of semi-permanent hair color is that it doesn’t last forever. Dye your hair using the same steps above once it fades to a color you aren’t quite happy with. You could also try a different color. If you bleached your hair before, don’t bleach it again unless your roots have grown out.  ","find the color you want. bleach your hair if necessary. perform a patch test. do a strand test. wash your hair with clarifying shampoo and blow dry it completely. protect your skin and clothes. figure out color placement. apply the hair dye. let the dye set. rinse out the dye. minimize hair washing. use color-protecting shampoo. keep your hair moisturized. repeat dyeing as needed.

"If you know you are writing a check, have everything but the amount filled out while you are waiting in line. Waiting until you have the total amount to start writing the check is ridiculous. Approximate Time Saved - 15 to 20 seconds.;  , These are by far the fastest options. Approximate Time Saved: 15 to 20 seconds.  These take longer to process than other transactions (sometimes up to 5-10 minutes). Approximate Time Saved: 5 to 10 minutes.  As a result, if you take three carts into a '10 items or less' express lane, even if the cashier does ring up your order, it will take two to three times longer than if you went through a normal checkout. Theoretically, express checkouts are designed to handle a slightly higher capacity of the posted item limit, so you might be able to get away with taking a few extra items. Plus you are likely to incite an incident among people within the limits who are on very short time frames. Approximate Time Saved: 2 to 5 minutes (and potentially loads of bad karma saved)  , Don't assume the cashier or bagger automatically knows because you come in all the time. They deal with hundreds, even thousands, of customers every day and cannot possibly be asked to remember every moot little detail. Can you memorize 5,000 different habits on short notice? Approximate Time Saved - 10 seconds to 60 seconds, depending on if re-bagging becomes necessary.  If you are using a hand basket instead of a cart, unload it. Merely hefting the basket up on the belt with the contents still inside is not only a major pet peeve of cashiers, it is a waste of time for you. When the cashier has to unload the items out of the basket (some do it all at once, others one at a time), it slows down the checkout process. Approximate Time Saved: 45 seconds to 2 minutes.  Checkout number light on means the lane is open. Light off means closed. Period. If you enter a closed checkout lane where a checker has already taken a till out, 9 times out of 10 a new till has to be counted and inserted, all because you failed to pay attention. At the minimum, there is a 30 second delay. You may even be informed that the lane is closed and sent to an open lane anyway, in which case two people have already gotten in line ahead of you. Avoid the confrontation - stick to lanes with the light on only unless directed to another register by an employee. Approximate Time Saved: 1 to 5 minutes.  Don't fish around for the exact change. This holds up the line for other people and delays you. Approximate Time Saved: 20-45 seconds (for you), 1-2 minutes (for people in line behind you).  Avoid shopping during the rushed hours between 3PM and 7PM if at all possible. Also avoid hours that appear to be shift changes for most stores. In states with 'blue laws' (laws restricting the hours during which alcoholic beverages can be sold) such as Ohio, where liquor cannot be sold after 10 p.m., and beer and wine can't be sold past 1 a.m., don't shop within 30 minutes of the cutoff hour, especially in large cities, or you will find yourself in a mad rush. Approximate Time Saved: 2 to 10 minutes.  If you know the line is going to be 5 minutes each time, and you shop every day, you are losing 35 minutes every week. Start shopping every week and you save half an hour every week. If you can restrict grocery shopping to every other week, even better! Approximate Time Saved: 10 to 60 minutes.

When you are preparing new beds or refreshing existing garden beds it is best to try not to import “garden soil” from another property as there is every chance you could be importing trouble. The soil could have been heavily limed or had added fertilizers high in phosphorous – thus making it unsuitable for native plants especially those that belong to the Proteaceae family (Grevilleas and Banksias to name a few).

"You will rarely be able to buy a car from a dealer and flip it for a profit, as these cars are generally sold at their highest price. Random people, however, don't have to pay employees or rent on a lot, and can afford to let go of their used car for much less than a dealer can. Confine your search to these sellers for the best results.  Don't be immediately turned off by 'salvage titles,' which are often some of the best deals on the market. Be sure, however, to ask what happened to earn the title. A broken window is a lot different than a cracked axle, but both could cause the car to be considered salvage.Carfax and other title check sites are good ways to get a cheap vehicle history for bigger buys.;  , Places like Edmunds and Kelly Blue Book let you input the car's make, model, year, and condition and see the general price. This is often a good baseline for negotiation, and can be used to effectively bargain if someone is grossly overestimating the price. These sites usually have ratings too, letting you see if the car has common issues to look for or has a record of reliability. Some tips to make the most of these sites include:  Note the 'dealer's price.' You can usually bargain down to the price they expect from a dealership, because there will be much less paperwork for both of you.  Check several sites at once, and always assume the car will be in worse shape than it is -- most people will try and sell at the highest price they can find online, and will err towards a better condition on their advertisement.  Be wary of any cars you come across that are already on and running. It takes the most energy and momentum to get a cold car started, and you can often hear or feel any issues with a bad motor as it lugs to a start. Be on the lookout for:  Cars that don't start easily or smoothly.  Loud noises or grinding sounds in the engine.  Ticking, whining, or shaking as the car starts.  As you do, ask about the car's history, starting with its last oil change. The lighter the oil, the better, and it shouldn't ever be dark brown or sludge-like, especially if it has been changed in the past six months. If you see any water or solid bits (like metal) in the oil, walk away -- repairs won't be cheap.  Have the seller rev the engine 5-6 times and watch the exhaust. If produces black or thick smoke you should walk away, especially if the oil levels are also low., A little water is to be expected. But oil or radiator fluid is a big no-no, and the car likely shouldn't be bought. Another good way to check this is to have someone rev the engine with the radiator cap off. If you see air bubbles in the radiator when the car revs, walk off -- the head gasket is likely blown.  Is the engine temperature high? If so, and there is hot water leaking from the car (not fluid or oil!), then you might be in for a bargain. This could just be a leaky house causing the overheating, meaning you can cheaply fix an expensive-seeming problem., There shouldn't be loud ticking noises or gurgling, and it's pretty obvious when something doesn't sound quite right. Have someone rev the engine in neutral and watch to make sure it still sounds good as you watch for any issues. Turn the car off and check the belts and hoses, looking for corrosion, rust, or heavy wear. While 1-2 belts and hoses are easy to fix, a complete overhaul could cut away any profits you hoped to make., If you're a true bargain hunter with some mechanical skills, you might buy a non-working car cheaply if you believe you can get it running. But in all other cases, you want to take the car for a spin. Test a variety of speeds and variations, ideally testing it in both a neighborhood and on a highway or road where you can get the speed up safely. As you do, pay careful attention to:  Steering: is it smooth and responsive?  Braking: Does it stop the car quickly, especially in quick-stop situations? Most importantly, does the car stop in a straight line?  Transmission: Does it shift smoothly? On automatic cars, you should be able to get into drive and reverse in less than a second and a half. Any longer delay could be a bad sign.  Electronics and Features: Do the lights, windows, and AC work? Is the odometer still running or is it stuck (and do they know how long ago it stopped running, if so?)., This is especially crucial if they didn't mention these deficits in the ad posting. Most people are honest and upfront about issues the car might have, but you should be constantly searching for other issues to use as a negotiating tool. If there are minor to serious issues that they didn't tell you, but you're confident can be fixed cheaply, you can often get serious discounts.  As you're examining the car, show them issues as you find them. Most people trust a calm, thorough buyer if you walk them through your tests and issues, making them more likely to take your word on price.  Gauge their own car knowledge as well. If they seem lost around an engine, you can use this to your advantage to play up any perceived issues.  If they don't have a title on hand, you should be very wary about buying the car. The title is required to get the car registered, and to subsequently get insurance for the vehicle. If they can't hand over the title, you better be sure the car is worth the hassle of getting it re-titled.  For more expensive cars, use a site like CarFax to get the title history and avoid any unpleasant surprises.  ","search car auctions, classifieds, ebay, and craigslist for cars sold by their owner. use online appraisal sites to get a good idea of the base price. always start the car from a cold engine. check the oil levels and oil color. search under the car for leaks once it's been running a while. pop the hood to listen and look at the engine. drive the car before buying whenever possible. use any and all perceived defects to drive the price down. be sure to get the title and copy of the car's registration.

"When writing an informal letter in German, as in English, you have more freedom in terms of starting your letter. It’s not necessary to write the date or address, though you can if you want. Give your letter an informal salutation that suits who you are writing to. Pay special attention to the spelling. For example, write “Liebe” (“Dear”) if you are writing to a woman, but “Lieber” (“Dear”) if you are writing to a man. Try one of these greetings:Guten Tag, Frau Müller (Good day, Ms. Müller)  Liebe Frau Müller (Dear Ms. Müller)  Lieber Heinrich (Dear Heinrich)  Hallo, Andreas (Hi Andreas)  Mein lieber Schatz (My dear honey)  Hallo mein Liebling (Hello my darling)  Hallo meine Süße (Hello sweetie - female)  Hallo mein Süßer (Hello sweetie - male)  , Since you are writing an informal letter, you have plenty of freedom for choosing what to say and how to structure it. In general, try to keep your ideas grouped together, and separate paragraphs with line breaks to make your letter easy to read.  Remember that you do not need to capitalize the first word of the body of your letter.  Even for letters to friends or family, it’s courteous to include an clear closing in your letter. You can be more casual or even intimate, depending on who you are writing to. Try one of these common closings:Herzlichst (Cordially)  Viele Grüße (Lots of regards)  Liebe Grüße (Lots of love)  Alles Liebe (Lots of love)  Dein (Yours - male)  Deine (Yours - female)  In Liebe (With love - for romantic relationships)  ","select an informal greeting. write the body of your letter. close your letter informally.

"It may take more than one night to determine the results of this test.The next opportunity that you have to “sleep in” for a few days is your chance to perform this test. You may need several nights in a row to get the best results.  Step one of the test is to go to bed at a reasonable time. If you are looking for a time when you can sleep in, then that probably means it’s a week-end or a series of days that you have off from your work or school. For the test to work, you have to resist staying up later than normal since you can “sleep in” the next day. Get accurate results from the test by sticking with a routine bedtime each night.  Next, do not set an alarm clock. Sleep until you wake up naturally. If you are like most people, you will probably sleep a long time that first night, maybe even 16 hours or more. This is because you are in a situation called sleep debt.  If you have a serious sleep debt, then you may have to deal with that before you can get the best results from this test. If your sleep debt is not substantial, then proceed with the test.  After the first night of longer than average sleep, continue with the same bedtime, and avoid setting an alarm. After a few days you will wake up at about the same time every day naturally. Now you know how many hours of sleep your body needs every night.  If you have gotten enough sleep, you should be alert and capable of doing monotonous activities without becoming sleepy.;  , Sleep debt occurs when you fail to get the amount of sleep your body needs, and it actually accumulates over time.You are borrowing minutes or hours every time you cut your night’s sleep a little short. This can occur in both the short term and over months.  Staying up late for work, play, or study, then getting up with an alarm clock because you have to, is a set-up for adding to your sleep debt.  Repay your short-term sleep debt by adding an hour or so to each night’s sleep, and take advantage of opportunities to sleep in or take a nap until you have paid back the amount of sleep you lost over a short-term.  This means that you need to keep track of the hours of sleep you lost, therefore you need to know how much sleep you need.  Longer term sleep debt accumulations may take several weeks, or even longer to pay back and get back on track.Take a vacation with nothing on your schedule, then go to bed at the same time every night and sleep every morning until you wake up naturally.  Don’t beat yourself up for sleeping a lot during this vacation. Just pay back your sleep debt and get back on a regular schedule.  Once you have repaid your debt and you stick to a regular bedtime, you will reach a point where you no longer need that alarm clock in the mornings. This is provided that your bedtime is early enough to allow your body to get the exact amount of sleep it requires.  If you go to bed “early” for you, but you still are tired and have trouble waking up in the mornings, then try an even earlier bedtime. Not everyone fits in the realm of the number of hours considered normal. You may need to naturally sleep a little more. If earlier bedtimes do not help, then talk to your doctor.  If you have worked at paying back your sleep debt and you still feel overly fatigued and exhausted during the day, then you may have an underlying medical problem or medication that is contributing to the problem. Make an appointment with your doctor to evaluate your persistent tired and fatigued feeling.  Understanding more about the symptoms associated with sleep debt is a great way to realize what happens when you deny your body the sleep it needs.A research study done by the University of Chicago followed a group of volunteers for six days that were only allowed to sleep four hours each night.  After only six days of accumulating a sleep debt, the people in the study experienced high blood pressure, increased levels of the stress hormone cortisol, made only half the normal amount of antibodies to a flu vaccine, and developed early signs of insulin resistance, which is the first step in developing type 2 diabetes.  Other symptoms observed in people with short-term sleep loss include difficulty concentrating, slower decision making, worsened vision, difficult driving, irritability, fatigue, and problems with memory.  Researchers have also evaluated the symptoms developed in people that go for longer periods of time without getting enough sleep. These symptoms include obesity, insulin resistance, stroke, memory loss, and heart disease.  Sometimes stress and physical changes can trigger the need for more sleep.Pregnancy is an example of a physical change that triggers an increased need for sleep, at least during the first trimester.  Other situations that may cause your body to need additional sleep include illness, injury, intense physical exertion, difficult emotional situations, and intense mental tasks.  Allow yourself a nap or a little extra sleep time at night to compensate for these stressors.  Many professional resources publish charts that provide guidelines for the general sleep requirements divided into age groups.As we get older, the number of hours of sleep we need each night lessen. The extreme ranges include newborns that sleep anywhere from 11 to 19 hours each 24 hours period, with 14 to 17 hours considered the average range, to adults over age 65 that sleep from five to nine hours each night, with the average being seven to eight hours.  Several credible sites, including the National Sleep Foundation, provide recommended sleep guidelines divided into age groups. The charts include recommended number of hours, appropriate hours, and provide ranges outside of the number of hours indicated to fall in a category of “not recommended.”  Realize that every person is unique and has additional factors that may cause him or her to fall outside the recommended ranges without labeling it as abnormal. For example, some people may be on medications or have underlying diseases that cause them to sleep more than the guidelines suggest.  Make the area where you sleep as comfortable and relaxing as possible.Start by controlling the temperature. Keep the bedroom at a comfortable and cooler temperature.  Use your bed for sleep and sex only. Avoid using your bed for other activities, such as studying, reading, playing video games, using any device with a screen, and watching late-night television.  Make sure your bedroom is quiet when it is time for sleeping, and as dark as possible. You may need to consider using window coverings to block out any light, and ear plugs or a fan to block out external noises.  Be sure your mattress and pillows are comfortable and inviting. If you share the bed, be sure it is large enough to allow for both parties to be comfortable.  Try to avoid allowing children and pets to sleep in the same bed.  If you work a second or third shift, then follow the same guidelines. Try to keep as consistent a sleep and wake schedule as possible.  Eating a healthy diet helps your body to function more efficiently in all areas including a healthy sleep cycle, but there are some specific things you can do to help improve your sleep quality.Avoid heavy meals late at night and just before bedtime, and avoid going to bed hungry.  Limit how much you drink in the evening to prevent frequent awakenings during the night to go to the bathroom.  Limit your intake of caffeine throughout the day, and try to stop drinking caffeinated beverages by 2pm each day.  Stop smoking or avoid smoking close to bedtime. Nicotine acts like a stimulant and can prevent you from falling asleep.  Avoid consuming alcohol close to bedtime. The initial response to alcohol is to feel sleepy, but in a few hours it changes and acts like a stimulant which can cause you to have trouble sleeping.  This includes everything from exercise during the day to getting exposure to natural sunlight.Exercise according to the recommended guidelines, which include at least 150 minutes of aerobic activity each week. Keep your exercise routines during the daytime or early evening. Avoid exercising just prior to bedtime.  The link between proper exercise and sleep is well-documented. Studies have shown that moderate aerobic exercise, such as walking, can significantly reduce the amount of time that individuals with insomnia take to fall asleep compared to no exercise at all.Take advantage of daytime natural light exposure. Sunlight provides the body with important vitamins and helps to regulate a healthy sleep-wake cycle. Limit your exposure to light closer to your bedtime.  If you need a nap, do not nap too close to bedtime and try to limit the nap to 20 to 30 minutes in the mid-afternoon.  This would include activities that take your mind off the stressors of the day.Some people like to read, others do crafts like knitting or painting. Consider taking a warm bath or shower, or listening to soothing music or nature sounds. Whatever works for you is great. If possible try to lower the lights during your relaxation time.  Develop healthy ways during the day to relieve stressors. Give yourself permission to take breaks throughout the day to relax, talk about something fun, and enjoy a laugh with friends. By managing your stress during the day you are helping to relieve that build-up of things to worry about just before bed.  Go to bed at the same time every night and get up at the same time every morning, including weekends and holidays.Even if you do not feel tired or sleepy, try maintaining your scheduled bedtime. If you have difficulty falling asleep quickly for several nights then you may need to adjust your bedtime.  Some guidelines suggest that you not go to bed until you feel sleepy or tired, while others recommend sticking with that scheduled bedtime. By maintaining the bedtime routine and schedule, you may feel sleepy once you are in bed and you allow yourself to relax.  If you do not fall asleep within 15 minutes of going to bed, then get up. By doing so, you avoid adding worry about not being able to sleep to your stressors. Get up and move around or do something relaxing for a few minutes, then go back to bed.  Avoid watching the clock. Relax, think of positive things from your day or relaxing activities that you enjoy, and try not to think about going to sleep.  There may be an underlying medical reason or medication that is contributing to your difficulty sleeping.Medical conditions can sometimes contribute to difficult sleeping. Examples of problems that may need to be evaluated by a psychiatrist or psychologist include depression, insomnia, ADHD, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic sleep disorder, and problems with nightmares or other emotionally disturbing sleep problems.  Examples of other medical conditions that are commonly related to sleep problems include sleep apnea, Alzheimer’s disease, dementia, chronic pain, restless leg syndrome, COPD and other breathing related disorders, allergies, epilepsy, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, GERD, and multiple sclerosis.  Some sleep problems are caused by disorders directly related to sleep. Examples of these disorders include circadian rhythm sleep disorders, delayed phase sleep problems, narcolepsy, cataplexy, sleep walking, sleep talking, REM sleep disorders, and shift work sleep disorder.  Sleep disorders can occur from a wide range of both medical conditions, mental health concerns, and disorders of sleep.Symptoms of sleep disorders include excessive sleepiness during the day, lingering fatigue, irregular breathing or increased movement during sleep, difficulty sleeping when you are tired and it is time for sleep, and abnormal sleep behaviors, which can include things like sleep talking and walking in your sleep.The length of symptoms associated with every possible condition that may be contributing to your sleep difficulty exceeds the capacity of this article.  Talk with your doctor sooner rather than later. It is not in the best interest of your overall health to delay addressing problems you may be having with your sleep. Your doctor will help you to get answers to all your questions as well as the proper treatment for the cause of your sleep problems.  Many medications can cause either excessive sleepiness and fatigue or problems with getting enough sleep.Do not adjust your medications on your own. If you think a medication is causing or contributing to your sleep problem, talk to your doctor. In many cases, the dose can be adjusted or another drug can be prescribed in place of the medication that is causing the problem.  Hundreds of medications have excessive sleepiness as a listed side effect. That list is too lengthy to reproduce here. Everything from antihistamines, to blood pressure medication, to pain meds can cause problems with alertness and sleepiness. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you think one of your medications may be interfering with your sleep.  Medications can also prevent you from sleeping well. While this list is also lengthy, it is probably shorter than the list of medications that cause drowsiness. Still, many drugs can possibly disrupt your ability to get a good night’s sleep. Talk to your doctor if you feel any medication you are taking is preventing you from sleeping.  If you continue to have difficulty establishing and/or maintaining sleep, there may be an underlying reason, such as depression, or you may just need to re-establish a healthy sleep pattern.Some agents are available over-the-counter that can help you to fall asleep easier. All sleep agents available without a prescription are intended for short-term use.  If your sleeping problem persists, talk to your doctor about prescription medications that may prove helpful.  ","perform a simple sleep test. pay back your short-term sleep debt. take a vacation for long-term debt. prevent health problems by getting the amount of sleep you need. recognize situations that change your sleep needs. identify your sleep needs by age. adjust your environment. pay attention to your eating habits. modify your activity throughout the day. develop a relaxation routine before bedtime. stick with your schedule. talk to your doctor if you continue to have difficulty. pay attention to changes in your sleep patterns. review your medications. take a sleep aid.

"You can’t be a country singer without being good at singing. Even if you consider yourself or have been told you are a good singer it is important to make sure you have the base singing skills necessary to be a singer. Find your singing range and practice singing regularly.If you have a lot of improvement that needs to be done or you just want to get your voice the best it can be, you might want to consider taking singing lessons. You can also use websites and phone apps to learn to sing.;  , In order to mimic the sound and learn the country style, practice by singing along to country artists you like who are in your vocal range. Women may want to listen to Tammy Wynette, Dolly Parton, Miranda Lambert, Martina McBride, Carrie Underwood, Allison Krauss, and Kellie Pickler.  Men may want to listen to Hank Williams, Tim McGraw, George Strait, Waylon Jennings, Kenny Chesney, Keith Urban, George Jones, Rodney Atkins, and Toby Keith.  Country singers have a specific sound to their voice. Whether you have the country twang naturally or not it is possible to learn to sing with a country style to your voice.  First try to put the country twang in your speaking voice. Mimic the country twang of singers, actors, and characters into your speaking.  Start singing with the twang by over exaggerating the sound of it. This will get the sound familiar on your voice. Once you have the feel of it down, tone it down. , This will help create your country sound and make song writing easier. If you really cannot learn you can have someone play while you sing and be a duo, but knowing how to play guitar is a major part of country singing.  The most important chords to learn for country music are G, C, D, and A. Country music is usually a combination of these chords. , There are plenty of country singers who cover other artist’s songs. Start by learning how to sing other country singers songs before you decide if you want to write your own music.  There are various types of country music. There is traditional country western music that is simple and about real life issues. Bluegrass is similar to country western, except it is entirely acoustic. It uses acoustic instruments such as the upright bass fiddle, acoustic guitars, banjos, and fiddles. There is also a newer genre of country music called pop-country. Which is pop music with a country feel. , You can write about whatever you want, but country music does tend to follow some of the same basic topics. Country music is stories set to music. There is usually a plot and characters just like a story except it rhymes and has a melody.  Common topics for country songs are broken hearts, betrayal, Jesus, the Devil, Mama, feeling blue, the South (Alabama, Tennessee, Louisiana, etc.), death, love, cowboys, and words of wisdom. , Once you have decided the subject to write about you can write the lyrics to your country song. There are plenty of sad country songs but the feel good songs are usually the hits. Country music is very literal so keep the lyrics simple. They should tell a story about what is happening around you or about what you know.  Unlike pop, the chorus is the most important part of country music. Use a lot of adjectives in your lyrics to describe something. Don’t use swear words. Some genres use or even encourage using swear words, but not country music. , People are going to remember the melody of your song before they remember the lyrics. You can build your song around the melody but don’t let the melody control your lyrics. The melody is a very important part of a country song. Without a melody you can’t feel the song and nobody will care about your song. Country songs have very simple melodies, harmonies, and chord progressions. The basic chord progressions to write your melody to is typically G, C, D or G, D, A, or a combination of those chords. There is typically no need for any fancy chord progressions. , There are many ways you can record your song depending on your resources and budget. You could work with a technical savvy friend, book time with a professional studio engineer, or just record your song at home using a microphone and computer software. Whatever way you choose to record your song, having a copy of an audio recording will open up many doors. , You music is copyrighted from the moment it is created, but if someone steals your music it is not protected in a lawsuit unless you register it. As soon as you have a final version written and recorded you can register it online at the U.S. Copyright Office for a small fee. Once you do this the song is yours. No one can use the original material without your permission. If you don’t do this someone can steal the lyrics or melody and make a new recording of it. They won’t need your permission or have to pay you any royalties. , Examples of PROs are ASCAP, SESAC, and BMI. They will collect any royalties and distribute them to you in an organized fashion. If your song is ever played on TV, iTunes, YouTube, or Spotify, you are entitled to royalty. Some PROs are free and others have a fee. , This will take a while but today’s technology makes this faster than ever. You can send your demos and mixtapes out to try to get noticed.  Send your demos to journalists, promoters, or management. Include your name, phone number, email address, and website on every CD that you send out. This way whoever listens to your CD will be able to contact you if they like it, whether they have your packaging or not. Keep your packaging simple. A simple note about who you are and any gigs you have will be good enough. Look through the album sleeves of country artists you like to find labels and managers to send your demos to. There are websites available such as Showcase, The Unsigned Guide and CMU Directory to help find the name and address of people to send your demos to. , Many singers get discovered when they perform their music live. Start with your friends, family, and those you feel most comfortable with. Then perform your music in the small venues: open mics, talent shows, and café’s.  Use who you know to get gigs. Even asking your friends to perform at birthday parties is a step in the right direction.  Use the gigs you get to find more. If you make a good impression, promoters or someone in the audience might ask you to perform somewhere else.  Ask small local venues or event organizer if you can perform at their venue or event. Try going to them in person or call over the phone instead of sending an email. , In order to stand out you need a fanbase. You will need to work hard to get fans to notice your work but having fans will open up many doors.  Publish your songs online. Once you have a clear recording of your song and you have copyrighted it, publish it. It is easy for anyone to publish their song online. Put your music on YouTube or Soundcloud so other people can see your work.  Use social media to create fans. Use Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and other social media sites to get people to find you. Be active on social media and reach out to fans. Promote your music on your social media. Have an image. Be yourself but have something about you that makes you known.

"The more locks, the better!;  , Don't 'hide' your spare key above the door-frame or under the doormat. Instead, put it someplace less obvious.  These can be purchased, or you can make them yourself.  This will make them impossible to open. Just hope they don't break the window.  This will give a potential-intruder the impression that somebody is home. A burglar is less likely to enter a home if he or she thinks that there's a chance of being caught, arrested, or hurt in the process.  Baseball bats and sharp sticks work well. Firearms work well, too, as they are effective even from a distance; but keep in mind that owning a firearm creates a whole new set of risks. Be sure that you know what you are doing if you opt to keep firearms around your house, and keep them well out of the way of young children.  Remember that even your own weapons can be taken from you, and used against you. Above all, be careful, and be sure that you receive proper training.  This will alert you to whether or not anybody is opening your doors and windows without you knowing. If someone is periodically entering your home, there's a good chance that they'll attempt to do so again.  , A tripwire is a string or fishing line, tied to a stick or a pole just above the ground, that causes a passerby to trip. These are often placed at the tops of staircases. Attaching noise-making devices (e.g. bells, chimes, etc.) to the tripwires will audibly warn you of intruders.  Dogs are great pets, but they can also be great security systems.  Tape the tacks onto the top of the fence, facing upwards. If an unsuspecting intruder grabs the top of the fence, he will get a handful of tacks. This will injure him, dissuade him from attempting to do the same thing again, and probably make him wonder what other sorts of booby traps you might have set up around your house.  ","buy a deadbolt for your door. if you have a spare key, be sure that it's well-hidden. look for long rods that you can jam in-between your doorknob and floor below, thus preventing intruders from being able to open the door from the outside while in place. if you have sliding-glass doors, or windows that slide open, insert broom handles or long pieces of wood at the base of each door and window, along the track that your door or window slides on. put a lamp or light on a timer, so that it turns on and off even when you are not home. consider keeping weapons around your home, just in case you need to defend yourself. put tape on your doors and windows. buy small, screw-type locks for your sliding windows, in order to prevent intruders from opening your windows all the way. , consider setting up some tripwires. consider getting a guard dog or watchdog. if you are worried about somebody hopping over your back fence, buy some clear packing tape and a box of thumbtacks.

"If you have an automatic payment option established with your account, accessing the account online will typically allow the cardholder to view the list of pending payments along with the scheduled dates. A quick review of the upcoming payments will make it easy to see if one or more need to be stopped and rescheduled for a later date.  Many providers allow a time frame in which pending payments may be canceled, changed or rescheduled. Make sure to initiate the change within the required period in order to prevent possible rejections by your bank, a situation that would result in the assessment of late charges and other fees and penalties.  Stopping a scheduled credit card payment requires nothing more than telephoning the provider, identifying the upcoming payment date and canceling that pending payment. Be prepared to provide information that confirms your identity and serves as authorization to make the changes. Alternatively, log into the account using your account credentials, access the pending payments and cancel the payment or payments that need to be delayed.  Keep a record of who you talked to, date, time, and outcome of call. Follow up with letter confirming conversation.  Confirmation of the changes to your payment schedule are usually provided instantly in an online environment or follow shortly thereafter in the form of an official email confirmation. If the changes are made by phone, the customer service representative will confirm that the changes are complete before ending the call, and will typically offer a confirmation number. Write down the number and keep in on file, just in case the changes do not make it all the way through the system for some reason.  If stopping a pre-arranged payment also means that you will be unable to make a payment on time, it is important to call the provider to notify them. This can help to potentially waive any late fees, and could establish good will.  For example, if you are postponing your monthly cell phone, call the provider and notify them you will be late. They may be able waive or negotiate a one-time reduction or elimination in your late fee.

"Advise people with whom you are staying that you are going on a walk and let them know where you are planning to walk.  Sandy areas too may prove treacherous so walk carefully and at a steady pace. The fragile sands found in coastal and sand plain districts are similar to those of a beach so hikers will tire quickly if they strive to 'conquer' the landscape. Pre-planning is a useful tool if you intend to stop at a scenic point for lunch or spend time painting, photographing or simply admiring the landscape, so you should gauge how long it should take you to get there at a slow and steady pace before you leave.  Not all Australian animals are deadly, but even the ones that aren't can ruin your day if you get bitten. If you wish to observe them, approach quietly and give them space. In well walked areas, or districts that are close to towns, larger reptiles and animals are rare. You are more likely to see reptiles in the summer when they are active, but you may occasionally see one in winter sunning itself on a rock.  Ideally do not touch them if you don't know what they are, for they may have small thorns or spines and / or have pollen or sap that can be irritating to the skin. Not all Australian flowers have perfume, but many do, including aromatic oils, so if you intend to smell them, do so carefully if you suffer from allergies. Be mindful that it is illegal to remove plants from a National Park.  Be it waterfalls, striking rock monoliths or the peace and quiet. If you intend to sketch, paint, meditate or do some other activity such as bird watching, it is recommended that you visit on a quiet day (such as a weekday) when you are less likely to be disturbed.  Generally, tracks are not always visible and Australia does not have many large predators such as wolves, bears, lions and tigers. But snake tracks can advise you to be alert. Most snakes and reptiles will move away from you if you make heavy stamping noises, but some snakes and lizards (called Goannas) can be aggressive and have been known to chase people.  Most wild animals will avoid humans but you may see them on your walk, particularly if you are walking deep into the outback areas. If you particularly wish to see larger animals such as Kangaroos, larger marsupials or reptiles it is highly recommended and much safer to visit a zoo or native animal sanctuary.  Many bush fires have also been caused by stray cigarettes and cooking fires that have cost lives.  ","start early in the morning in the summer, or when the chance of frost has passed in the winter. expect to encounter rocks and slopes if you walk in a hilly terrain. treat any animal, reptile or insect you see with respect and caution. observe any interesting flora. enjoy the landscape. keep an eye out for animal tracks. remove all waste that you bring in to national parks as there are very high fines for careless littering.

"Keep an eye out for marketing campaigns that have caught your eye or seem to be successful. Find out if the work was done in house or by a marketing consultant.  Hiring someone who is based in your area will allow you to meet face to face and work similar hours. Search online, in the phone book and by posting an advertisement for a project on Craigslist.  Although it may seem strange to consider hiring someone that you found on the Internet, all marketing consultants should have an online presence. Internet marketing is a large part of what they do, so it is the sign of a legitimate business. You should always vet your consultants carefully before hiring.  These boards ensure you will only be speaking with people who work on a contract basis. You will need to specify where the person can be located, and arrange to tell the job specifications so that they can submit a proposal.  ","ask for referrals from other businesses. contact local marketing consultants for bids. post your project listing on elance.com, ifindconsultants.com or other online freelance job posting boards. "
"Hallucinations are common for someone on acid.Someone who is using LSD may report seeing things that are not there, hearing things that are not producing sound, or smelling things that are not producing any odor. The person may also see things with his or her eyes closed.Watch the person to see if he or she seems to be interacting with things that are not there, such as staring at a wall, talking to him or herself, or grasping at the air.  These hallucinations can be frightening for the user and can become dangerous or deadly if the user is unaware of reality for too long.;  , Blended sensory experiences are common for users of hallucinogens such as LSD. This is when a person’s senses are swapped and the result can be quite scary. This shift in perception is also known as synesthesia, and it can cause a person to “hear” colors or “see” sounds.Pay attention to what the person says to determine if he or she might be having blended sensory experiences. For example, if the person says something like, 'That tree sounds beautiful,' or 'I can see the music,' then these are good indications that he or she may be on LSD.  Synesthesia alone is not a sign that someone is using LSD. A small percent of the population experiences synesthesia naturally, so don't get confused and think they are using LSD.  Sometimes LSD users experience distortions of size, time, depth and speed, believing that an object is much larger than it actually is or that an object is moving much more quickly than it actually is. Someone who is using LSD can also experience an altered sense of time.Try asking the person questions, such as:  How far away is that tree?  How big is that house?  How long have we been sitting here?  What time is it?  , A person going through an LSD trip may experience heightened senses, causing them to see, smell, touch, hear, and taste things more powerfully. This is part of what is considered the psychedelic experience: the ability to see colors more vividly and feel things more deeply.A user will be unable to conceal their intense sensations and these signs should be easy to spot.  Try offering the person something to drink, or play some music, or put on a movie and see if he or she responds in a way that seems normal. If the person seems more impressed than usual or overwhelmed by the sensory experience, then it is possible that the person is using LSD.  LSD can cause a person to develop insomnia, making it almost impossible for him or her to fall asleep or sleep for long periods of time. If you notice someone barely getting any sleep at all, this may be a sign that the person is a frequent LSD user., LSD can cause a reduction in appetite, making the person’s desire for food nonexistent. Watch out for a complete change in someone’s eating habits to spot this sign of LSD use.For example, if the person goes from eating regular meals to not eating at all, then this is a strong sign that he or she may be using LSD.  Many times users of LSD are unable to complete simple tasks such as driving or operating machinery. Be aware of these signs as they may indicate that the person has taken acid.Other signs might include having trouble operating the remote control for the television, being confused by simple instructions, or struggling to find the right key to open his or her door.  When on acid, some people may enter a totally dissociated state, often causing severe panic and fear. Some people experience delusions and can have terrifying thoughts and feelings.Pay attention to the person’s behavior. Some possible indicators that the person might be using LSD may include seeming agitated for no reason, sharing concerns that someone is after him or her, or seeming confused about his or her surroundings.  Someone who is on LSD may also ramble or make bizarre and unusual comments. This incoherent speech is often a sign that the person has used LSD.  ","determine if someone may be experiencing hallucinations. listen for signs that the person is having blended sensory experiences. notice if someone is experiencing distortions. watch for intensified senses. notice if someone is having trouble sleeping. look out for a loss of appetite. notice if someone has an inability to complete tasks. watch for paranoia, distress, anxiety or disorientation.

"You should begin doing this once it is fully feathered (a fledgling). You can leave seeds, insects (dead mealworms and crickets work well), and fruits (cherries, grapes, plums, etc., which can be cut up into smaller pieces). Eventually the bird will begin pecking at the food out of curiosity.;  , Tap the dish a couple of times and then feed the baby bird from it. You can also hold up the dish to the bird and try to coax it to eat from it.  This will encourage the bird to eat by itself, and it will begin to prefer not being hand-fed anymore.  It may still beg for food but will no longer need you to feed it.  Start by dipping the bird's beak in a shallow dish of water, or put a few drops of water on the bird's beak.  ","start leaving small dishes of food and water for the bird. feed the bird from the dish. once the bird is eating on its own, start decreasing the amount of food you hand feed it. after a couple of weeks, the baby bird will be eating independently. around this time it will also need to learn how to drink water.

"Color adheres better to unwashed hair. Bleach and dye may irritate or even burn your scalp without the protection of your natural oils.If you already have pale and entirely ash blonde hair, you can skip the lightening part.;  , First use a wide-tooth comb, and make sure your locks are completely tangle-free. Part hair into four equal sections with a fine-tooth comb. Twist the top two sections up completely, and secure them with clips. Part the back two sections down the middle.If you’re having trouble parting or sectioning your hair in the back, stand in front of a large mirror. Hold a smaller mirror in front of you above your head with one hand, and use your comb with the other.  Use one ounce (28.3 g) of powder bleach for every two ounces of developer. You can find these products online or at local beauty supply stores. A lightener is necessary to lift your hair to a pale shade of blonde.Use a 20 volume developer. Don’t use 30 or 40 volume developers at home.Bleach powder and volume developer typically comes together in kits. If your hair is thick or longer than your shoulders, you’ll need two kits.If you’ve never lightened your hair with bleach before, it’s best to go to a professional to get it done. Bleaching can damage your hair and/or scalp, and should be used very carefully.  Take down sections of hair over a sheet of foil, beginning with the bottom sections. Paint lightening mixture onto the hair with a brush. Make sure to thoroughly saturate the hair with the brush, using multiple strokes in various directions as needed. Roll each section up into the sheet of foil after you paint it. Once finished, leave the mixture in your hair for up to 45 minutes, until your hair reaches a yellow stage.You may want to keep your darker roots and apply the opal effect to only the ends of your hair. If so, leave a few inches of hair close to your scalp (or however much you prefer) untouched with each section you paint.  Make sure to wear gloves and follow all safety precautions that came with your lightening kit. Check your hair with gloved hands every five to ten minutes. Never leave bleach on your hair for longer than 45 minutes.  Fine hair lightens easier than coarse hair. Thus fine hair will process faster than coarse hair., Shampoo the hair to fully cleanse your hair of the mixture. Don’t use conditioner at this point. Towel dry your hair., Any sections of hair you’ll be using the opal technique on must be a clean blonde rather than brassy or orangish.If your hair is still orange rather than yellow, you’ll need to tone out the orange and/or lighten your hair more., Combine an ashy toner with a purple- or silver-based shampoo and conditioner. Mix one part conditioner to 1/4 part toner or semi-permanent hair dye. Apply it with a brush and let it sit for fifteen to twenty minutes before rinsing it out.Condition your hair and wait a least a week before lightening your hair with bleach again. When you reapply the bleach, leave it in until your hair becomes yellow (about twenty to thirty minutes). Then rinse it out completely right away.  The goal is to achieve a silver blonde hue. Combine an ash blonde toner with 10 volume developer in a bowl. Use a 1:2 ratio. Stir it well with a brush., Make four equal sections and clip them up. Prepare sheets of tin foil and a new hair coloring brush for applying the base color. Begin dyeing the front sections of your hair first.  Wear gloves whenever you’re using hair dye. Make sure you’re in well-ventilated area (such as a bathroom with the fan on and/or window open). Have a damp paper towel nearby to wipe away any dye that gets on your face or neck.  Do this section by section, making sure to coat the hair thoroughly. If you’re only dying the ends of your hair, just look for the lightened portions and paint them., Once the appropriate amount of time has elapsed, thoroughly wash the color out of your hair. You can use shampoo to make sure you’ve completely removed the product. Allow your hair to dry before proceeding with color streaking.  Hair dye processing times typically take between fifteen to forty-five minutes, but you should always follow the length of time in the product’s guidelines.  The color may appear slightly lavender or blue at first. After a couple of washes, it will set into a silver shade., Create pale shades of orange, blue, purple and green by diluting color with white conditioner to achieve softer hues.Add a small amount of color into each bowl using conditioner as a base.Have a separate brush ready for each bowl of color.  Alternately, you can use purchase pre-mixed pastel colors., Brush different pastel shades onto sections of your hair in streaks. Alternate between thin and chunky sections. Let your inner artist take over by blending complimentary pastels on top of each other.For example, blend pale lavender into light yellow or green to achieve a look of iridescence.  Optionally, you can use pieces of foil as a backing when you’re brushing on colors.  Mix the colors in separate bowls. You can skip adding conditioner, or add a small amount of white conditioner. Create a rich green, blue and purple, each with its own brush and bowl.The rich colors should be accents to the pastel. For example, brush a bit of a vivid color on the end of a section already colored with pastel.  Let it sit as long as the product instructions advise. Then rinse the color out of your hair. You can use shampoo to thoroughly cleanse your hair, and follow up with conditioner.  If you hair looks damaged or feels dry to the touch, visit a hairdresser for a moisturizing treatment; alternatively, you can make your own. Quenching thirsty locks will help your color to last.Apply a coconut oil treatment to your hair once per week, or when your hair feels dry. If your hair becomes weighed down and greasy, use the treatment less often.  Use a moisturizing, sulfate-free shampoo. Once in a while, use a purple or blue toning shampoo. If you use the latter too often, the purple or blue can begin to tint your hair. But if you lather with it only occasionally, it will prevent your hair from shifting to beige.Invest in a quality, sulfate-free conditioner and a salon grade shampoo for colored hair.Use a blue or purple toning shampoo a few times per month., Touch up your roots every four to eight weeks, or as needed. When you notice your rainbow colors fading away, repeat the color streaking method. Opal hair color is high maintenance and tends to fade fast.  ","don’t wash your hair beforehand. comb and section your hair. mix powdered bleach with developer. paint sections of hair. wash out the lightener. confirm that your hair is light enough. use a blue-based toner to neutralize orange hues. mix the base color. part your hair into sections. brush on the color. leave the color in according to the product’s directions. mix pastel colors in separate bowls. apply pastel colors liberally. add vivid colors subtly. remove the color. condition your hair as needed. alternate shampoos. maintain your roots and color streaks.

"Up until quite recently in history, the vast majority of births occurred in the home. As of 2009, however, in the United States, only about 0.72% of all births were home births.Statistics for most other developed countries are similarly low. Despite their relatively rarity in developed nations in the modern era, some mothers greatly prefer home births to hospital births. There are numerous reasons why a mother might choose a home birth over a hospital birth. However, it should be noted that some scientific studies have associated home births with a 2-3 times greater risk of complication.Though the elevated rate of complication is still not very high in absolute terms (corresponding with only several births experiencing complications per every 1,000), undecided mothers should understand that home births may be slightly more risky than hospital births. On the other hand, home births offer certain advantages that hospital births may not be able to, including:Greater freedom for the mother to move, bathe, and eat as she sees fit  A greater ability for the mother to adjust her position during labor  The comfort of familiar surroundings and faces  The ability to give birth without medical assistance (like the use of painkillers), if desired  The ability to meet religious or cultural expectations for birth  Lower overall cost, in some situations;  , In certain situations, births carry an increased risk of complication for the child, the mother, or both. In these situations, the health of the mother and child outweigh any minor advantages a home birth may offer, so the birth should be carried out in a hospital, where experienced doctors and life-saving medical technology are available. Here are situations in which an expectant mother should definitely plan to give birth in a hospital:When the mother has any chronic health condition (diabetes, epilepsy, etc.)  When the mother has undergone a C-section for a previous pregnancy  If prenatal screening has revealed any health concerns for the unborn child  If the mother has developed a pregnancy-associated health condition  If the mother uses tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs  If the mother has twins, triplets, etc. or if the child hasn't settled into a head-first position for delivery  If a birth is premature or late. In other words, don't plan a home birth before the 37th week of pregnancy or after the 41st week.  Generally, home births are not prohibited by most state or national governments. In the UK, Australia, and Canada, home birth is legal, and, depending on the circumstances, the government may provide funding for it. However, the legal situation in the United States surrounding midwives is somewhat more complicated.  In the United States, it is legal in all 50 states to hire a certified nurse midwife (CNM).CNMs are certified nurses who usually work in hospitals - though it's rare for them to make house calls, it is legal to hire them for home births in every state. In 27 states, it is also legal to hire a direct-entry midwife or certified professional midwife (CPM).Direct-entry midwives are midwives who attained their status through self-study, apprenticeship, etc. and are not required to be a nurse or doctor. CPMs are certified by the North American Registry of Midwives (NARM). CPMs are not required to carry insurance and are not subject to peer review.  It's highly recommended that you have a certified midwife or doctor accompany you for your home birth. Make plans to have the midwife or doctor come to your home well in advance - meet and discuss your birth with him or her before your labor is likely to begin, and keep his or her number on hand so you can call if your labor begins unexpectedly.  The Mayo Clinic also recommends making sure the doctor or midwife has easy access to the consultation of doctors at a nearby hospital, if possible.You may also want to consider finding or hiring a doula - someone who provides continuous physical and emotional support throughout a mother's labor.  Giving birth is an emotionally and physically draining experience, to put it lightly. The last thing you'll want to do during labor, when you may in intense distress, is to have to make quick, important decisions about the way the birth will proceed. It's far smarter to create and review an approximate plan for your birth well before you enter labor. Try to account for every step of your delivery, from beginning to end. Even if you're not able to follow your plan exactly, having the plan will give you peace of mind. In your plan, try to answer questions like the following ones:Besides the doctor/midwife, which people, if any, do you want present for the birth?  Where do you plan to deliver? Note that, for much of your labor, you will be able to move around for comfort.  What supplies should you plan on having? Talk to your doctor - usually, you'll want lots of extra towels, sheets, pillows, and blankets, plus waterproof coverings for the bed and floor.  How will you manage the pain? Will you use medical painkillers, the Lamaze technique or another form of pain management?  , The vast majority of home births are successful and free of complication. However, as with every birth, there is always a small chance that things can go wrong which threaten the health of the child and/or mother. Because of this, it's important to be prepared to rush the mother to a hospital in the event of an emergency. Keep a full tank of gas in your car, and keep your car well-stocked with cleaning supplies, blankets, and towels. Know the quickest route to the nearest hospital - you may even want to practice driving there.  Though you'll be able to adjust your position and even walk around for most of your labor, it's a good idea to have a place in your home set aside as the final site of childbirth. Choose a safe, comfortable spot - many mothers prefer their own bed, but it's possible to give birth on sofas or even on a soft part of the floor. Regardless of the location you choose, make sure that, by the time labor begins, it's been recently-cleaned and it's well-stocked with towels, blankets, and pillows. You'll probably also want to use a water-tight plastic sheet or covering to prevent blood stains.  In a pinch, a clean, dry shower curtain will work as a water-tight barrier to prevent stains.  Though your doctor or midwife will most likely have these things, you may also want to have sterile gauze pads and ties ready nearby for cutting the baby's cord.  Once you've made all the necessary preparations, simply wait for your labor to begin. On average, most pregnancies usually last about 38 weeks, though healthy labor can begin within a week or two of the 38 week mark.If you enter labor before the 37th week of pregnancy or after the 41st week, proceed immediately to a hospital. Otherwise, be prepared for any of the following signs of your labor beginning:Your water breaking  Dilation of the cervix  Bloody show (the discharge of a pinkish or brownish blood-tinged mucous)  Contractions lasting 30 to 90 seconds  , The healthcare professional you have chosen for your home birth has been trained to deliver babies safely and has been certified to do so. Always listen to your doctor or midwife's advice and do your best to follow it. Some of the things s/he may advise can temporarily cause your pain to increase. However, doctors and midwives ultimately want to help you get through your labor as quickly and safely as possible, so try to follow their commands as best you can.  The rest of the advice in this section is intended merely as a rough guide - always defer to the advice of your doctor or midwife.  Labor can be a prolonged, painful ordeal, and a certain degree of nervousness is almost inevitable. However, it's never a good idea to give in to thoughts of desperation or hopelessness. Do your best to stay as relaxed and lucid as possible. This will allow you to follow your doctor or midwife's instructions to the best of your ability, ensuring your labor is as quick and safe as possible. It's easiest to stay relaxed if you're in a comfortable position and breathing deeply.  As previously noted, most home births occur without a hitch. However, complications are always a small possibility during childbirth. If you notice any of the following signs, proceed to a hospital immediately, as these may signify serious pregnancy complications which require the technology and expertise available at a hospital:Traces of feces appear in your amniotic fluid when your water breaks  The umbilical cord drops into your vagina before the baby does  You have vaginal bleeding not involved with your bloody show or if your bloody show contains an especially large amount of blood (normal bloody shows are pink, brown, or somewhat blood-tinged)  You don't deliver the placenta after the child is born or the placenta isn't delivered intact  Your baby isn't born head-first  Your baby appears distressed in any way  Labor does not progress into childbirth  , During the first stage of labor, your cervix dilates, thinning and widening to allow for the passage of the baby. At first, discomfort may be minimal. Over time, your contractions will gradually become more frequent and more intense. You may start to feel pain or pressure in your lower back or abdomen that increases as your cervix dilates. As your cervix dilates, your attendant should perform frequent pelvic exams to monitor its progress. When it's fully dilated with a width of about 10 centimeter (3.9 in), you're ready to enter the second phase of labor.  You may begin to feel an urge to push - your attendant will usually tell you not to do so until your cervix has dilated to 10 centimeter (3.9 in).  At this point, it is usually not too late to receive pain medication.If you have planned for this possibility and have painkillers on hand, talk to your doctor or midwife to assess whether or not they are appropriate.  In the second stage of labor, your contractions will become more frequent and more intense. You may feel a strong urge to push - if your cervix is fully dilated, your birth attendant will give you the OK to do so. Communicate with your doctor or midwife, notifying him or her of any changes in your condition. S/he will instruct you when to push, how to breathe, and when to rest. Follow these instructions as well as you are able. This stage of labor can last up to 2 hours for first-time mothers, while in subsequent deliveries this stage can be far shorter (sometimes as short as 15 minutes).Don't be afraid to try different positions, like getting on all fours, kneeling, or squatting. Your doctor or midwife will usually want you to be in the position that is most comfortable and allows you to push most effectively.  As you push and strain, don't worry about accidentally urinating or defecating - this is extremely common and your birth attendant will expect it. Concentrate solely on pushing out the baby.  The force of your pushing, combined with your contractions, will move your baby from the uterus into the birth canal. At this point, your attendant may be able to see the baby's head. This is called 'crowning' - you can use a mirror to see it yourself. Don't be frustrated if, after crowning, the baby's head disappears - this is normal. Over time, the baby's position will shift down the birth canal. You'll need to push hard to get the baby's head out. As soon as this happens, your birth attendant should clear the baby's nose and mouth of any amniotic fluid and assist you in pushing the rest of the baby's body out.Breech birth (when a baby's feet come out before its head) is a medical condition that carries added risks for the baby and will most likely necessitate a trip to the hospital. Most breech births today result in C-sections.  Congratulations - you have just had a successful home birth. Have the doctor or midwife clamp and cut the baby's umbilical cord using a sterile pair of scissors. Clean the baby by wiping him or her with clean towels, then clothing him or her and wrapping him or her in a clean, warm blanket.  After giving birth, the birth attendant may recommend initiating breast feeding.  Do not bathe the baby immediately. At birth you will notice the baby will have a whitish covering. This is normal - the covering is called a vernix. It is thought to provide protection from bacterial infections and moisturize the baby's skin.  After the baby is born, though the worst is over, you aren't quite done. In the third and final stage of labor, you must deliver the placenta, which is the organ that nourished your baby while it was in the womb. Mild contractions (so mild, in fact, that some mothers don't notice them) separate the placenta from the uterine wall. Soon after, the placenta passes through the birth canal. This process usually takes about 5-20 minutes and, compared to delivering a baby, is a relatively minor ordeal.  If your placenta doesn't come out or doesn't come out in one piece, go to the hospital - this is a medical condition that, if ignored, can have potentially serious consequences.  If your baby appears perfectly healthy after birth, it probably is. However, it's important to take your new son or daughter to a doctor for a medical examination within a few days of birth to make sure s/he isn't suffering from any medical conditions that can't easily be detected. Plan a visit to a pediatrician within a day or two after giving birth. Your pediatrician will examine your baby and give you care instructions.  You may also want to receive a medical examination yourself - childbirth is an intense, demanding process, and if you feel out of the ordinary in any way, it's best to have a doctor determine whether anything is wrong.  Water birthing is exactly what it sounds like - giving birth in a pool of water. This method of birth has become more popular in recent years - some hospitals even offer birthing pools. However, some doctors don't consider it to be as safe as conventional birth. While some mothers swear by water birthing, claiming that it's more relaxing, comfortable, pain-free, and 'natural' than normal birth methods, it does carry certain risks, including:Infection from contaminated water  Complications from the baby swallowing water  Though very rare, there is also a risk of brain damage or death from oxygen deprivation while the baby is underwater.  Like any home birth, water births shouldn't be attempted if the baby or mother are at risk for certain complications. If any of the conditions listed in Part One apply to your pregnancy, do not attempt a water birth - instead, plan to go to a hospital. Additionally, you shouldn't attempt a water birth if you have herpes or another genital infection, as these can be transferred to the baby via water., Within the first 15 minutes of labor, have your doctor/midwife or a friend fill a small pool about a foot deep with water. Special pools designed specifically for water births are available for renting or purchase - some forms of medical insurance will cover the cost. Take your clothing off below the waist (you may choose to be completely nude if you prefer) and enter the pool.  Make sure your water is clean and no hotter than 100 degrees Fahrenheit (about 37 degrees Celsius)., Some mothers prefer having their partner (spouse, etc.) in the pool with them while they give birth for emotional support and intimacy. Others prefer to have their doctor or midwife in the pool. If you plan on having your partner in the pool with you, you may want to experiment with leaning back on the partner's body for support as you push.  Your doctor or midwife will assist you through your labor, helping you breathe, push, and rest when it's appropriate. When you start feeling the baby coming, ask your doctor/midwife or partner to reach between your legs so s/he will be able to grab the baby as soon as it comes out. You will want to have your hands free to hold on tight when pushing.  As with normal labor, you may change your position for comfort. You may, for instance, try pushing while laying or kneeling in the water.  If, at any point, you or the baby show any signs of complications (See Part Three), get out of the pool.  As soon as the baby is out, hold it above water so that it's able to breathe. After momentarily cradling the baby, carefully get out of the pool so that your cord can be cut and the baby can be dried, clothed, and wrapped in a blanket.  In some cases, the baby will have his or her first bowel movement in the womb. In this case, get the baby's head above water and away from any contaminated water immediately, as serious infection can occur if the baby inhales or drinks any of its own feces. If you believe that this may have happened, take your baby to a hospital immediately.

"Debt consolidation firms may have different educational prerequisites for different jobs. Some customer service jobs will only require the equivalent of a high school education to be a good candidate.;  , Although this is not strictly necessary, you should consider it as a way to ensure success in the debt management field. The following are good educational paths to take.  Seek an associate's degree in financial management or business management. This 2-year degree will allow you to learn the basics of risk management, investments, debt and credit and financial law. These programs can include online and night classes if you are currently working.  Seek a bachelor's degree in financial management, business administration, economics or finance. These degrees will give you an in-depth background on how to manage a business and finances. A finance or business degree will also give you some sales and customer management skills that will help you to work in the debt consolidation environment.  Working in telesales will introduce you to working with a sales quota, something you will face in the debt consolidation environment. 2 years of sales experience, while in school or right after, is seen as excellent experience, especially if it is in the financial sector.  Inquire whether you are required to obtain a license with your state licensing board or secretary of state. While license requirements will differ from state to state, working as independent debt manager will usually require you to submit an application, undergo a practice and ethics exam and pay a licensing fee.  A debt consolidator may not be required to become licensed if you are hired and trained by a company. A debt manager title may fall under the licensing requirements of a financial manager, and thus be more highly policed by your state's licensing agency.  Look online for customer service, information technology, debt consolidator and debt manager positions. Also, look in your local newspaper or classified boards to find local debt consolidation agencies.  Create a resume that you can change and focus for each job application. Resumes and cover letters should be tailored to each job description, since no single debt consolidation job is the same. Applying for several different positions may help you discover the best job for you within the debt consolidation industry.  The following are paths you can take, depending upon your interests:  Seek a job with a for-profit debt consolidation company. These companies may offer high commissions for their best consolidators. You will work in a sales environment where you will be required to sell a product to debtors and seek excellent terms from credit card companies. Check that these companies are licensed and accredited before applying. Check their reviews on the Better Business Bureau website to make sure they maintain a high standard of services and ethics.  Seek a job with a non-profit debt consolidation company. Most states have non-profit services that help to provide debt consolidation services. In these jobs, you will be mainly working with secured loans, rather than variable loans, and counseling people on changing the way they think about debt and money management. You are likely to work in an environment that values education and counseling over sales quotas. They may offer lower salaries and few sales incentives to their employees.  Become a private debt manager. If you are licensed in your state independently, you may choose to market yourself directly to debtors. This path is best taken after 5 to 10 years of experience in financial services or risk management. You can offer personal plans and services that are more in depth than most telephone-based consolidation companies. You may also be able to find a position as an independent worker in a financial services firm.  The success of a debt consolidator is often measured by the terms they can negotiate when they contact a creditor for a debtor. Working as a third party debt consolidator means that you rely on your customer service and negotiation skills while still retaining relationships.  ","receive your high school diploma or equivalency. apply for a degree in higher education. gain work experience in a sales environment. obtain a debt management license in your state. look for jobs at private or non-profit debt consolidation agencies. apply for jobs according to your industry preferences. develop excellent relationships with creditors.

"A simple and effective way to prevent corrosion to your guitar's parts is to play it with clean hands. The oil and dirt that naturally accumulate on your hands can eventually lead to degradation and corrosion of your guitar's strings, frets, tuning pegs, pots, and other metal parts that are touched frequently.;  , Although strings can be replaced easily, prolonging their life will improve your guitar's tone and save you money. Give the strings a quick wipe with a clean, lint-free cloth after each playing session to remove sweat and oil that can lead to corrosion.  The tuners on a guitar are usually made from steel, and the constant rotations to which they are subjected increases wear and exposes the metal to rust and corrosion. To prevent this, apply a few drops of machine oil (available at hardware stores) to the tuning pegs every few months.  Use aluminum foil; rub it against the rusted string to clean off all surface rust. Wipe down with a kitchen towel or cloth. Repeat as often as required to remove any rust., If any of your guitar's electrical components ever malfunction or need to be replaced, hire a professional technician to perform the repair. Working on your guitar's electrical parts yourself can lead to faulty connections and exposed wiring, both problems which can lead to accelerated corrosion.  Most metal guitar hardware has a chromed finish, but bits of this finish can be stripped away through bumps and scratches. If the underlying metal is left exposed, it can develop rust and quickly deteriorate. Have a professional technician repair the metal's finish promptly before rust develops.  If a guitar is left exposed to the air, the continuous buildup of dust and atmospheric pollutants will eventually mar the finish of both the body and the metal hardware. Keep your guitar in a hard shell case when not in use to preserve and protect its finish.  Ideally, a guitar should be stored at a relative humidity between 45 and 55 percent. Higher or lower moisture levels can cause cracking or warping of the wood and corrosion of wiring and metal parts. A dehumidifier can be used to control the humidity in your home. You can also place small desiccant packets inside the guitar's case to control humidity.  ","wash your hands before each use. wipe the strings with a lint-free cloth after playing. oil the tuning pegs regularly. clean rusted strings. allow a professional to perform any electrical repairs. repair damage to chromed parts promptly. store the guitar in its case as often as possible. monitor the humidity in which the guitar is stored.

"Identify anything that's causing you to procrastinate, then get rid of it. Sell it or put it in a storage locker. Move away from it. Throw it away. You can't become motivated if you're squandering all of your time.  If you're spending too much time aimlessly browsing the internet, install a 'productivity' extension in your browser. These free extensions allow you to block certain sites and/or set time limits for recreational browsing.  Hold yourself accountable in your own eyes and the eyes of others. Set personal penalties for yourself if you don't act - throw out some delicious cookies you've been saving or make a donation to charity. Tell your friends and family about things you plan on doing. If you don't do these things, they'll know, and you'll be embarrassed - now you have a great reason to get started!  , Only you know where to draw the line in terms of dosage - one person's typical morning brew might make another jittery and unfocused all day. A moderate dose can make you feel alert, oriented, and focused.  Write yourself little notes to keep you motivated or set a reminder on your phone that reminds you every 20 minutes, this might get annoying enough to make you actually do it.  If you've already got a caffeine addiction - that is, you need caffeine just to function normally - you might be out of luck!  Stay away from more powerful stimulants unless a doctor has prescribed them for a specific condition. They can be extremely habit-forming if used carelessly.  Go for a short run, do some jumping jacks, or shadowbox. Even light physical exercise can affect our moods, making us feel more active and dynamic. Exercise has even been shown to thwart depression and low self-image - both hurdles to personal motivation efforts., If you're having serious motivation problems, breaking one large task into many small tasks can make it much easier to approach psychologically. Because we get a feeling of accomplishment from completing each step of the task, this trick can increase motivation substantially. Sometimes, all that's needed to gain the momentum to tackle the whole project is to complete the first simple step.  Even tremendously motivated people can be driven to lethargy and inaction if they have to perform tedious, repetitive tasks for weeks or months on end. Break up the monotony with spontaneous and out-of-the-ordinary activities. Try to create an internal sense of unpredictability - even you don't know exactly what you'll do tomorrow. This can ease the psychological tedium of work that is the same day after day. Here are just a few ideas you might want to experiment with:  Spend a lunch break at a scenic place outdoors.  Have an impromptu soccer game with friends or coworkers.  Surprise your workplace with some home cooking.  Take a friend or significant other out for a night on the town, even if there's no special occasion.  Change your personal style.

"You'll need about 10 feet of paracord, scissors, and a lighter or matches.  Fold the piece of cord in half.  Wrap the folded cord around your wrist. Measure the cord by taking the ends through the loop created by the fold. Make a clasp by creating an overhand knot where the bracelet should meet. Essentially, it will be a ball and loop closure with the knot acting as the ball.  To make an overhand knot, take the ends together in your hand. Cross it over itself in the front, making a loop. Push the ends through the loop in the back, bringing them forward. Tighten the loop to form the knot.  Cut off the ends. You should now have a length of folded-over cord as long as your wrist with a knot on one end.  Place the fold end of the bracelet cord up. Take the other length of cord. Place the middle of it behind the fold, about an inch from the top.  Pull the right cord over the middle section. Pull the end back to the right, creating a single loop over to the left.  Pull the left cord over the top of the loop. Weave it under the middle section. You should also have a small loop on the right. Pull the left cord up through it and over it.  Pull the ends to tighten the knot.  Pull the left cord over the middle. Pull the end back, creating a loop on the right side (and a smaller loop above it on the left side).

"A lot of food in your child's plate may overwhelm them, which could lead to food throwing. Instead of piling food on your child's bowl or plate, regulate the amount of food you are serving out each time, and add more once they clear their plate., If the child is not listening to you and continually throws food or drops their plate on the floor, end the meal. Once the toddler understands the consequences of their actions, they may stop throwing food.If you are worried that your toddler didn't get enough to eat, you can give them a healthy snack later.  When your child starts to throw food, it's important to make them aware of the rules even if they don't fully understand what you are saying. Tell your child not to do it and ask them if they are still hungry before ending the meal.Say things like 'Are you done?' or 'Not hungry anymore?' when your child starts throwing food.  Give your toddler positive feedback when there is a successful meal that's free of food-throwing.

"NSAIDs can reduce the pain and inflammation associated with a tailbone injury. Avoid NSAIDs if you have had gastrointestinal bleeding in the past, are taking a blood thinner, or have a history of kidney disease., The pain from a tailbone injury can be complicated by constipation and difficult bowel movements.

"Because of various issues like ticket availability, price fluctuations, and limited timetables, you will have a much easier time traveling across the U.S. if you plan your trip well in advance.  The first step is choosing the time of year to travel. Peak travel times in the U.S. are in the summer, and more broadly between April and September. Ticket prices will climb during this period; availability will decline; and cabins will be more crowded. The best times of year for getting inexpensive tickets but still enjoying pleasant weather and scenery are autumn and spring.  The next step is choosing your exact train schedule using timetables. Amtrak offers timetables for all of their routes at each station; they can also be downloaded online. Most Amtrak routes run either 1 or 2 trains daily.  There are several online resources where you can read which routes are more scenic as well as other Amtrak travel tips. Amtrak's own 'Whistle Stop' web page offers travel tips submitted by customers.;  , After planning a route, you should purchase your tickets as far in advance as possible. Tickets can be purchased in person at each Amtrak station. They can also be ordered online at amtrak.com, or over the phone by calling 1-800-USA-RAIL. This phone service is only available to American and Canadian customers.  Amtrak prices its tickets incrementally. As each train fills up, the remaining seats are raised in price. This makes it advantageous to book your trip well in advance, especially if you intend to travel during the summer or around a holiday.  Discounts are available on Amtrak tickets through membership in certain organizations, such as the American Automobile Association (AAA). Discounts are also available to senior citizens and active military personnel.  Boarding and traveling on an Amtrak train is a straightforward process.  Begin by arriving at your station early. The Amtrak website can advise you how long before your scheduled departure you should arrive at each station. Have your ticket ready.  Your ticket will be checked as you enter the train. Amtrak tickets do not usually have a specified seat number, so you can choose any available seat. Once seated, remain there until the attendant can place a seat check above your seat. This seat check indicates that your seat is occupied and lets the attendants know when your stop is near.  Traveling on Amtrak can get you to many major U.S. cities, but traveling within cities or in the regional area must be accomplished using a different service. Before leaving, study the public transit services in your destination cities to determine how to transfer from an Amtrak train to a regional train or bus.  ","plan your trip. purchase tickets for your journey. board each train in your journey. connect to different transit services as necessary. "
"Weak or tight muscles can worsen your posture and fail to properly support your neck. Working on these may reduce the chance of the neck pain recurring. Once you can perform these exercises without pain, schedule them every other day. The day off is important to give your muscles time to rebuild., Stand against a wall or doorjamb. Place your feet about 3 inches (7.5 cm) out from the base of the wall.You may sit against a straight-backed chair instead, if it has a headrest.Take advantage of this when you have a moment during a long drive.  Allow your chin to drop down toward your throat. This should stretch the back of your neck, and tighten the small muscles around your throat.  Feel the large muscles on the front of your neck. If they are tense, lift your head again and lower your chin more slowly. The large muscles should stay relaxed, while the small muscles between them should tighten., Without raising your chin, move your head back so it touches the wall.  If this causes pain, pull your head back as far as you can without pain. This is a sign of forward head posture, which you can correct with other exercise and lifestyle changes.

"To stop that from happening, you should put a lot of thought into how you’re going to argue with her without fighting. Don’t be impulsive! Think ahead of time and give yourself enough time to put together a proposal that will have good odds of winning her over.  If the thing you’re asking for has a deadline — tickets for a concert or permission to go to a party, for example — start planning well ahead of time.  You also want to have the conversation where you ask for permission ahead of the deadline, just in case the first answer is 'no.' The first answer isn't always the final answer — with some time, you may be able to change her mind. But you need enough time to do it.;  , The most obvious answer, obviously, is just “Because I do!” but that’s not enough to convince your mom. Think of the positive benefits you would receive beyond just happiness.  For example, this might be the only time in the past five years that your favorite band has come to your city. If you don’t see them this time, you may have missed your chance for several years down the line.  It may be an important bonding experience for you and your friends. It would make you feel lonely and sad if you were the only member of your circle of friends who wasn't allowed to attend a birthday party.  Can you frame thing the you want as a learning experience? For example, 'Driving to school on my own will teach me self-sufficiency. I'll have to wake up and get ready on time by myself, without you having to push me along.'  , Your mom is probably dealing with problems every day that you never even know about — work, bills, carpools, meals, cleaning, and dealing with her children’s needs. When she hears one more request, she might be tempted to just say “no” because she already has so much on her plate. To prevent that, tell her all the things you’ve been working on yourself. Why do you deserve this thing that you’re asking for? Some examples might include:  You’ve kept up good grades for a long time, or maybe you’ve worked hard to raise a low grade in a class you’d been struggling in.  You do your chores every day without complaining.  You haven’t asked for any favors in a long time.  Parents bribe their kids all the time to get them to behave — from allowance to trips to the zoo.Why not use that same strategy with her? After telling her why you want the thing you’re asking for and why you think you deserve it, you should be able to move on to what you will offer her as a trade. Some examples might include:  Watching younger siblings for two weekend nights so your parents can have some time to themselves for date nights.  Taking on extra chores around the house. Be specific and think about what she'd be most grateful for. If you know that vacuuming hurts her back, offer to take that off her hands.  If she hates cleaning the cat’s litter box, tell her you'll do that from now on.  If the thing you’re asking for costs money, offer to pay for as much of it as you can afford.  Cleaning any or all of your home  Doing yard work  Cleaning and/or washing the car  Cooking meals  Washing dishes  Taking out the trash and/or recycling  Doing laundry  The important thing to remember is that the more specific you are, the more believable your promise is. Promising to “be good” is too vague to sound convincing, and she won’t believe you’ll follow through. However, giving her clear, detailed promises will make a world of difference.  Put yourself in your mother’s shoes: what do you think are going to be her reasons for saying no? Even if you think her reasons are unfair, by listing them and brainstorming ways to work around them, you improve your chances of getting what you want. This will probably involve compromise on your part, so be prepared to give up a little bit of what you want. For example:  She won’t like that there will be members of the opposite gender at a party; tell her that she can come chaperone if she wants.  She’s too tired to take you to the amusement park this weekend; tell her you will take care of all her responsibilities the night before so she can relax and get a good night’s sleep. This includes laundry, cooking, cleaning — everything she might do.  She’s worried that if she lets you start driving yourself around town, you’ll lie about where you are; tell her you’ll call her from your friend’s home phone or from the business line of wherever you’re going so she can verify with caller ID that you’re where you said you’d be.  If you start asking things of your mother when she’s busy concentrating on something else, or when she’s in a bad mood after a long day of work, you’re probably not going to have much success.  Watch her carefully, looking for a time when she is relaxing and in a good mood, but doesn’t look like she needs that time to herself desperately.  Try not to catch her during the “me-time” she needs to unwind at the end of the day, but don’t catch her in the middle of a busy day, either. Find a perfect middle ground, where she’s relaxed and in a good mood.  You know you're asking for something she doesn't want to give you. Give her all the information she’ll need to set her mind at ease about her hesitations. For example:  If you’re asking for a smartphone, explain that she can set controls on how much of her money you can spend in the app store, or whether you can spend any money at all.  If you’re asking to go to a party, tell her where it will be held, who will be there, and which adults will be chaperoning. Give her the adults’ phone numbers so she can speak to them for herself; talking to other adults can put parents’ minds at ease.  If you’re asking for permission to date someone, tell her all about the boy/girl you like. Tell her you want her to meet them before she makes a decision about whether or not you can date.  We’ve all heard it: “Because I said so.” The vague “no” is much harder to argue with than a specific “no” because comes from a place of authority: I am your mother and you have to obey me. You can't argue with that! However, if she gives you the actual details being her reasoning, you can argue against her logical argument more easily.  Keep a curious tone, not a defensive one. There’s a big difference between screaming “WHY?” at your mother and asking “But can you please just explain to me what problems you have with this, specifically? I just want to understand. And maybe there’s something I can do to make you feel better about it.”  Be open-minded while she speaks. Your mother has a lot of life experience and loves you very much, so she’s probably just doing what she thinks is best for you. You don’t have to agree with her opinions, but you have to respect that she has them.  She’ll appreciate that you know she’s reasonable and just wants what’s best for you.  “What would you like me to do to earn this privilege?”  You’ve already brainstormed some bribes. If they don’t work, then this open-ended strategy, which hands control over to her, might get you closer to your goal.  Be open and eager to compromise.  Even if your mother says “no” off the bat, that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s the end of the conversation. Instead of crying or losing your temper, show her how mature you are instead.  “Okay, Mom, you’re saying no right now. If that’s your final answer, I’ll respect it, but can I ask you to wait one week and come back to your decision? If I behave well enough for the next week, maybe I can convince you to change your mind.”  “I’m not asking you to change your mind. I’m just asking you to keep an open mind and see how hard I can work to earn this privilege.”  , If you’ve asked for something that you want, but it’s not a huge deal if you don’t get it, maybe you should just let it go if your mother says no. If you make a big deal out of every request, your mom will get tired of arguing with you over time, and just start saying no to everything.  Be smart about whether or not this is important enough to keep bugging her about. Save your big arguments for things that really matter.  If going to the movies with your friends this weekend isn’t a huge priority, maybe you want to save your big fight for a much more significant privilege, like getting your own cell phone or learning how to drive.  Even though you’re allowed to feel how you feel, you should know that part of winning an argument involves learning to control your emotions.  Work on keeping your voice normal and level — if you notice yourself getting louder or the pitch of your voice getting higher, take calming breaths to work out that tension you feel in your throat when you get upset.  Balance your logical argument and your feelings. The discussion should be more about the argument you brainstormed in the previous section than how you’re feeling in the current moment.  If you worry that you’re going to lose your temper or cry, show your maturity by asking your mom if you can take a break until you calm down.  You might say, “Mom, I think I’m getting too worked up about this, and I’m not going to help my case by crying or yelling. But I do want to keep talking about this. I just need a break to regroup. Can we do that, please?”  , Words can have a huge effect in how your argument comes across to your mother. There’s a big difference between “you never let me do what I want” and “it would make me so happy and grateful if you let me do this.” Some language you can keep in mind includes:  'Please may I...'  'Could I please...'  'It would be really great if I could...'  'It would really help me with ______ if I could...'  'I would really appreciate...'  , In any argument, no matter how respectful and civil it is, you'll probably feel the urge to keep making your case, even when she's talking. This is very disrespectful, and suggests you think you deserve more time to speak than she does.Remember that in any conversation with your mother, she's the one with the power. If you rub her the wrong way, your chances of getting whatever you want are basically zero.  Control the urge to speak over her, even if you have great points to make.  Wait until she’s finished her line of thought. Don’t just sit through it, but actually listen to it and absorb what she’s saying.  The more you listen, the better you’ll be able to argue directly against her points. This is more effective than just making your case blindly from your own point of view.  To further prove to her how seriously you’re taking her point of view, use “connecting words” like “ok,” “yeah,” “uh huh,” and so on while your mother's talking to showing that you’re actively paying attention to what she’s saying.,  Maintain eye contact — it shows her that you’re paying close attention, not letting your attention drift like you have better places to be.  Uncross your arms and legs. Many people think crossed arms and legs as a sign that you're closed off or distant. You want to show your mother that you are open to what she has to say.  Nod your head when she’s making her points. Just like the “connecting” words, this shows that you’re following her.  Keep the long game in mind — be upfront and honest with her about everything, even if you think she won’t like it. You already anticipated her concerns and planned out responses to them when you were brainstorming for this conversation. If you did a good job of that, you’ll have nothing to hide.  Note that you may not get what you want every single time by being honest. However, if you get caught lying, you’ll find that your mom becomes harder and harder to persuade, and she’ll be suspicious even when she has nothing to worry about.  ","give yourself time to prepare.you’re about to have a hard conversation that could easily turn into a fight if you’re not careful. brainstorm a list of reasons why you want what you want. detail the reasons you believe you deserve it. sweeten the pot with a bribe. predict and answer her concerns. choose the right time.timing is everything when it comes to having a big conversation. provide her with all the information she needs to know. ask her for her honest reason for why she’s resisting.sometimes, parents just give “parent” answers instead of real ones. ask her to set her own conditions.by making a request, then asking her to change the rules and limits of what you asked for, you’re showing her that you respect her authority. ask for a delayed response if she says 'no' at first. pick your battles. stay as calm as possible.if it looks like your mom is going to say no, you might feel the telltale signs of anger and frustration: your skin starts feeling hot, your heart beats faster, your voice starts getting higher and louder. choose your words carefully. don’t interrupt her. use attentive body language.to persuade your mother, you want to use every tool in your kit, and nonverbal communication is a very effective tool when it comes to persuading someone. be honest with her.every time you get caught lying to your mother, you make it that much harder to win her over the next time you need to persuade her of something.

"Wear heavy duty clothing, gloves and eye protection as you never know what you will encounter. Many construction companies use the city dumps to dispose of material that they can't use or that they feel is not worth reclaiming. But you won't have the labor costs involved to strip paint from old windows and doors or to remove nails from lumber that the company would have, so it could be a great find for you.  ","visit your community dump if they allow it. "
"Arrange for someone else to take you home after the test and take the rest of the day off work and other responsibilities.  Your doctor will probably advise you to avoid standing for long periods of time, exerting yourself with physical exercise or engaging in sexual activity during the initial 24 to 48 hours of amniocentesis recovery. It is also a good idea to avoid stressful situations that could place undue strain on you and your baby during this time.;  , Call your doctor if any symptoms occur.  While mild cramping is completely normal for the first day or 2 after amniocentesis, pain or cramping in the lower back or abdomen that does not subside should be checked out by your doctor. Contractions, where the abdomen tightens and then relaxes, can also accompany cramping and may signify premature labor has begun. This symptom also requires an immediate call to your doctor, to ensure labor does not progress if you are not full term yet.  A small amount of spotting from the cervix can also occur during amniocentesis recovery, but if the bleeding becomes heavy or is accompanied by a loss of clear fluid, emergency medical attention is required. Bleeding or discharge from the site of the amniocentesis is also cause for concern.  A patient recovering from amniocentesis should also be on the lookout for signs of a developing infection, such as a fever, chills or discharge from the vagina or amniocentesis site. Antibiotics may be needed to keep the infection in check so it does not harm the mother or unborn baby.  If the baby is moving more or less than what was typical before the amniocentesis, check with your doctor to see if an evaluation of the baby (such as an ultrasound) is warranted.  Because this test is often used to screen for potentially serious issues with the baby, the wait for results can be a stressful time.  Spend time with your spouse, family members or close friends who can offer you the support you need during this difficult time of waiting. Remember that the large majority of amniocentesis results come back completely normal, so the odds of serious problem are usually slim. Professional counseling may also be helpful, particularly if the results of the amniocentesis are not positive and the baby has a genetic or developmental problem.  ","plan to rest for 24 hours after the procedure is complete. know the warning signs of a problem after amniocentesis testing. evaluate the baby's movement and compare it to normal activity within the womb before the amniocentesis test. seek out support while waiting for the results of the amniocentesis test.

In particular, you should discuss what personal possessions you will lose in the bankruptcy and which debts bankruptcy can eliminate. Your options other than bankruptcy include the following:Reworking your budget. If you can lower your expenses, you can contribute extra money to your debts and eventually pay them off.Selling assets. You can sell any unnecessary assets and use the proceeds to pay down debt.  Consolidating debts. You can take out a personal loan to cover all of your current debts. If the personal loan has a lower interest rate, then you can lower your monthly debt payments.  Making a consumer proposal. You offer to pay your creditors a percentage of your debt or to pay off the debt over a longer period. Your creditors must vote to accept or reject the proposal. If approved, you make payments according to the payment plan and unpaid debts are eventually forgiven. A consumer proposal is available to individuals who owe less than $250,000 (excluding mortgages).  Making a division I proposal. This is like a consumer proposal but for those whose debt exceeds $250,000.  You might not be able to find an LIT, or no LIT will take your case. In this situation, you should contact the OSB’s Bankruptcy Assistance Program. They may be able to help. However, you must meet certain requirements:You can’t be in jail.  You must have contacted at least two LITs and tried to hire them.  You can’t have been involved in commercial activities recently.  You can’t make so much money that you will need to make surplus income payments under a bankruptcy.  You must complete a bankruptcy application and other paperwork with your LIT. The LIT will file the bankruptcy application with the OSB.After filing your application, the LIT will also notify your creditors that you have filed for bankruptcy.  All garnishment and other collection actions will stop once you file your bankruptcy application. If these actions don’t stop, speak to your LIT.  After you file, your LIT will work directly with your creditors. You should stop making payments to unsecured creditors, such as credit card companies.However, you will still need to continue making payments to secured creditors unless you give up the asset.  After creditors are notified of the bankruptcy, they can call a meeting. If one is called, you must attend as the bankrupt.Your creditors can ask you questions during the meeting.  Generally, most people who file a personal bankruptcy do not have to answer questions in a meeting of creditors., Depending on your circumstances, you might have to answer questions under oath from the OSB. The questions will cover a variety of topics, but the purpose will be to root out fraud. You might be asked the following:Your conduct. For example, the OSB might believe you incurred a debt because of fraud.  What caused your bankruptcy. You should be prepared to speak honestly about what brought upon the bankruptcy.  How you disposed of your property. If you gave away assets right before filing for bankruptcy, the OSB will want to know why. You might have transferred assets to family to shield them from the bankruptcy.  The LIT can sell some of your property and use the proceeds to pay off your creditors. However, federal and provincial law will shield some assets from being sold.You should have talked with your LIT before filing about what you will be able to keep. Generally, you can exempt the following within a certain dollar limit:personal items, such as clothing  household goods, including furniture and food  car (in some situations)  home (only in some provinces)  tools of the trade  retirement savings and pension  , Debtors with sufficient income must pay off a portion of their debts. These payments are called “surplus income payments.” Whether you must make surplus payments will depend on how much you make and the size of your family. The larger your family, the more money you can keep.  The OSB has created standards for deciding whether you need to make surplus payments and how much. For example, one person is allowed $2,089 a month in income.If you make more, then the LIT will help calculate how much you must pay.  The length of time you must make surplus income payments depends on whether this is your first or a subsequent bankruptcy.  If your income changes, you must notify your LIT.  To successfully complete your bankruptcy, you must fulfill certain obligations. Your LIT will discuss these with you. Generally, you must do the following:  Attend two financial counseling sessions.

"Cheilitis (chapped lips) is a common side effect of accutane treatment.In order to both prevent and treat chapped lips, apply a lip balm of your choice. Some have a pleasant scent like lavender or wild berry, while others are unscented.  The most hygienic lip balms are those which come in a small retractable tube, as you don’t have to touch your hand to your lips in order to apply the balm.  However, the balms which require you to manually remove a glob of lip balm from the container and apply it to your lips have the advantage that you can scoop any amount you desire from the container.  If lip balm is ineffective, use something stronger to protect your chapped lips.Vaseline or Aquaphor should be applied by dipping your pinky in the container and applying a light coating to your lips or around your mouth as needed.  Apply the ointment two to three times each day in addition to using Vaseline, Aquaphor, or a lip balm. You could also use a low-potency corticosteroid ointment if you obtain a prescription from your dermatologist.Using corticosteroid treatments for more than a few days could lead to thinning of the skin on your lips or the enlargement of blood vessels in the area you applied the ointment.  Always use ointments and prescription medications as directed.  The more you lick your lips, the drier and more painful they will become over time. Keep your tongue in your mouth and apply lip balm instead as needed.  Wear a rubber band on your wrist and give it a small snap when you catch yourself licking your lips. The slight irritation of the band against your wrist will minimize your likelihood of lip-licking again.  ","use lip balm. use vaseline or aquaphor healing ointment. use otc hydrocortisone ointment.for extremely dry lips, use a 1% ointment. do not lick your lips.while it may provide temporary relief, the enzymes in saliva can irritate your skin.

"You should start by visiting your local library for research books and texts on the Civil War. You can look for scholarly texts online at the library and ask the reference librarian for assistance with finding research books about this historical event.You can also look at magazines, newspapers, and catalogues from the time period at the library. The library should have these texts on microfilm so you can scan through them and get an idea of the fashions, trends, and discussions happening during the time.  Your library may also have a Civil War section where there are texts that focus on different aspects of the Civil War. Check with the reference librarian about a section or grouping of research books that focus on this historical event.;  , You can get a lot of the human elements of the Civil War by reading personal documents written by soldiers during that time. Many soldiers kept diaries on the front and sent letters to loved ones. You can use these documents to get into the mindset of a Civil War soldier and of someone waiting for a soldier to come home safely.You can find a cache of letters and diaries by Civil War soldiers online through the U.S. National Park Service (NPS).You may also be able to access personal documents through a Civil War historical society.  Depending on where you live, you may be able to get in touch with a Civil War historical society in your area. You can then ask them if there is going to be a Civil War reenactment coming up. These events are a great way to see how soldiers used weapons during the Civil War as well as how they dressed, how to interacted, and how they used other tools in camp during the war.These reenactments are also a great opportunity to experience the sensory details of being in a battle during this time, from the sound of cannons and muskets firing to horse-drawn ambulances rumbling on the ground.  Civil War reenactments often occur on special holidays to commemorate war heroes, such as Veteran’s Day or Memorial Day. You may also be able to find out more information on the dates of the reenactments from your local Civil War historical society.  You should also reach out to the experts to get a better sense of what life was like for soldiers and civilians alive during the Civil War. You may be able to locate experts through your local Civil War historical society or through a Civil War museum in your area.You can also look up experts online and contact them with specific questions about the Civil War. Try to contact experts who specialize in a certain aspect of the Civil War, such as Civil War weaponry or the role of women during the Civil War. This way, you can get detailed information about the topic.  If possible, you should consider trying to follow the path of the historical figures of the Civil War by doing some of their daily chores and practices yourself. You may volunteer at a Civil War reenactment or at your local Civil War historical society so you can get some hands on experience.You may try to do some of the domestic work of the time period, such as tend a stove fire all day, do embroidery, and use an outhouse. You may also dress in some of the clothing of the period to experience what it felt like to get dressed during this time period.  You may also practice using weaponry from the time period to get a sense of what it was like to fight during the war. If possible, it may be useful to also visit the sites of some of the battles of the Civil War, many of which have become monuments, to get a better sense of what it was like to walk through the site and fight on it., You can also get a better idea of the genre by reading popular examples of civil war historical fiction. You can then compare and contrast these texts, looking at the approach their writers took to address the material. You should also note the narrative style and tone of each text. Example texts include:Mrs. Lincoln's Dressmaker by Jennifer Chiaverini.  The Killer Angels by Michael Shaara.  My Name is Mary Sutter by Robin Oliveria.  The Red Badge of Courage by Stephen Crane.  Much of the American Civil War happened on the battlefield or around the battlefield. Your story will likely involve at least one battle scene or several battle scenes. You may choose a particular battle and focus on researching the details so it appears historically accurate and convincing on the page.You can read through a detailed list of Civil War battles to get a better sense of which battles were pivotal for certain groups or companies of soldiers through American Civil War Story. There were thousands of small battles during the war but many of the major battles are listed and documented.  You may also choose a well known Civil War battle, such as the Battle of Palmito Ranch in May 1865, the last battle of the Civil War. You may then focus on the details of the battle and place your characters in this battle as the setting for the conflict and the major events.  You should also consider what civilian life was like during the Civil War and use the domestic space as a setting for your story. Maybe you focus on how women and older people who did not fight in a battle lived.As the war escalated, many civilian areas became battlegrounds, forcing civilians to go into hiding or leave to become refugees in another area of the country. This means that they have have domestic lives that were then interrupted by the war. You could describe the contrast between these two settings.  You should also consider how the Civil War affected the North and the South of the country in different ways. Individuals who lived in the South were often refugees or casualties of war and did not maintain a domestic way of life for long.  When you are building your historical setting, you should try to always use details and description that invoke the senses. Consider how a room smells, looks, feels, sounds, and tastes to your characters. Using sensory detail will immerse your reader in the world of the story.For example, you may describe a battle scene based on how it felt to trample through mud and blood, and how the mud and blood smelled to soldiers during the battle. You may also describe how food rations tasted to soldiers who hadn’t eaten in days and the sound of cannons firing from across the battlefield.  You should lean on the fascinating history of the Civil War and the historical figures of the time to create characters. You may focus on a soldier from a certain town or area or civilians who survived as refugees during the war. You could then use their historical backstories to create characters for your fiction.You may decide to focus on lesser known figures of the war, such as the African American soldiers who fought in the conflict or the enemy soldiers who lived in prisoner of war camps. Or you may decide to look at the war from the point of view of a spy for the enemy.You may also focus on a civilian woman who is away from her soldier lover during the Civil War or you may use historical figures like a known General or high ranking officer.  Make sure you strive for accuracy when you create characters for your historical fiction, as readers are more likely to buy into a story that feels well researched. Often, the facts can be even more entertaining than fiction. Try to strive for accuracy and realism in your writing, especially if you are using existing historical characters as models for your fictional ones.For example, if you are writing about a character who is a soldier in the war, you would not include details about weaponry that did not exist during the Civil War, like handguns or grenades.  You should also try to strive for historical accuracy when you are writing about civilian life, where individuals lived in towns or villages without running water or electricity. Do not include details that do not fit the time period, as this will signal to your reader that you have not done enough research about life during the Civil War.  You should also sit down and create character studies of your characters so you have a better sense of their backstory. You may create character studies for all of your characters or for several key characters, including your protagonist, your antagonist, any love or friend interests, and any supporting characters. An example character study may look like:Physical characteristics: Female, short, plump, wide nose, big eyes, with long plaited hair. Scar on her left hand from a musket shot gone wrong.  Emotional characteristics: Smart, strong, self-sufficient, ability to use a musket and other weaponry, a desire to fight for her country.  Begin the writing process by creating a plot outline. This will give you a general sense of where your story is going to go. You can deviate from the outline once you get into the writing. But having an outline as a guide can make it easier to get into the writing and start generating words on the page.  One option is to use a plot diagram as your outline. A plot diagram contains six sections: the set up, the inciting incident, the rising action, the climax, the falling action, and the resolution.  Another option is to use the snowflake method. The snowflake method is often used by writers who do not want to follow the more traditional plot diagram, but are still looking for a way to organize their story. The snowflake diagram consists of a one sentence summary of the story, a one paragraph summary of the story, character synopses, and a summary of scenes.  You should consider centering your story around a major event in the Civil War or several historical events during this time. Your story is about life during the war, after all, so it should feature events during the war that caused major issues. You can then have these conflicts create problems for the characters in your story.For example, you may write a story about a young woman from the South who tries to disguise herself as a man and fight for her country. You may then center her story around a known brawl on the battlegrounds that occurred in camp or around a gathering of soldiers at a banquet that occurred during the war and use the event to show her character in action.  Though you should always try to be historically accurate in your writing, you should also remember that you are writing fiction. You do not need to follow the history completely when you are writing your story. You may decide to deviate from the history of the Civil War for the good for your story and as a way to generate more conflict for your characters.For example, in your story about a woman trying to fight as a man on the battlefield, you may realize that there were physical exams in place to prevent such a thing from occurring. You may then create a distraction or a way out of the exam for your character, allowing her to somehow get away with enlisting as a woman.  Though this may not be historically accurate, it does help to further your plot and your story. For this reason, it may be worth doing.  Cliches are phrases that have become so familiar they have lost their meaning. You should try to push yourself to come up with original descriptions and details that will seem unfamiliar and surprising to your reader.For example, rather than describe the sound of cannon fire as “vibrating with a loud boom”, you may go for a more unfamiliar description, as “tossing the ground like an earthquake” or “vibrating like the trembling hand on the trigger of a musket.”  , You should take the time to read the draft of your story out loud. Listen for any awkward sentences or cliche terms. Highlight them for revision. Make sure you are certain of the historical details in your story. If you are unclear about any of the details, you should go back and do more research to ensure you got it right.  You may also read your draft out loud to a trusted reader for a second opinion. Be willing to accept feedback and constructive criticism, as this will only make your story stronger.  ","look up resources at your local library. read diaries, letters, and personal documents by soldiers. attend a civil war reenactment. speak to civil war experts. learn how to do civil war chores and practices yourself. read examples of historical fiction. describe a particular battle. describe civilian life during the war. use sensory description. model your characters after historical figures in the civil war. include historically accurate character details. determine the physical and emotional characteristics of your characters. create a plot outline. use events from the civil war in your story. deviate from history for the sake of conflict. avoid cliche descriptions and details. read and revise your story.

"A recent addition to Bangkok transport, the sky train was built to combat the intense traffic situation. If you are out on the street during rush hour, always opt to travel in the sky train. Covering all the major stops in the city, the sky train will take you to your destination in just a fraction of the time that you would spend of the road. The Disneyland space-agedness feeling that it provides makes your journey on the sky train just as interesting as the attractions in your destination. Your bird's eye view of the city will give you a glimpse of the many hundred vehicles crawling their way through the heaviest congestion. Breathe a sigh of relief that you are not down there! The real cherry on the top of Bangkok's sky train are the ticket prices. Cheap in price and soaring above traffic and pollution, there is absolutely no reason to not choose the sky train.;  , If you cannot fly above there is a way down below: the mass rapid transit (MRT), Bangkok's subway system. This subway is pretty much an underground version of the Sky train. In fact, it reaches a number of regions in the city that the sky train does not. There are stations located everywhere and several can be found in close proximity to a number of Bangkok Serviced Apartments as well the famous Anantara Baan Rajprasong Bangkok Serviced Suites. Again the biggest blessing of the MRT is evading the heavy traffic overhead. Since prices for the MRT are just as cheap as the sky train, it is again another sensible option during Bangkok's rush hour.  Covering the whole Western Edge of the city, this is an excellent mode of transportation to truly appreciate the authentic Bangkok atmosphere. The breeze is heavenly, the water is sparkling, the backdrop is picturesque and the price is dirt cheap.  These three-wheeled rickshaws are perfect for evading traffic as they somehow manage to squeeze their way from one lane to another, getting you to where you want to go. Tuk-tuks come in handy when you have arrived at your stop via Sky Train or MTS and still have substantial distance to cover within the region. Fortunately or unfortunately, tuk-tuks have little regard for traffic rules and hence it does not hurt their conscience to jump lines and disregard cues. While this can make for a scary or dangerous ride, it will get you where you're going, and fast.  This is the fastest and perhaps the most exciting way to get around the busy streets of Bangkok. Clad in orange and purple vests, these taxi drivers are readily available to whisk you to your destination. Able to literally squeeze their way through the nastiest traffic jams, this can be a huge help during Bangkok's rush hour.  ","use the sky trains. take the mrt. make an adventure of your travels with the chao phraya river boat. travel shorter distances in a tuk-tuk. take a motorbike taxi. "
"Examples: 'I am afraid of performing because I messed up last year' or 'I don't want to sing this song in front of people because I didn't practice' or 'I don't want to give this speech because I might disappoint my friends/ family/ speech teacher' and finally 'I am scared of performing this piece because I think I am a bad performer';  , Is that really something you should worry about now?

"Before you can get started making your marble maze, you will need to collect the materials. Having everything gathered can make the process easier, more fun, and will help you notice if anything is missing. To make the marble maze, you will need these following things:Cardboard box or sheet.  Plastic, flexible drinking straws.  Some kind of glue.  A marble.  Scissors.;  , It can be a good idea to think of the maze layout before actually building it. Planning the maze out before hand can let you know if it will make sense, be to easy or be too difficult. Have fun drawing out a few different maze plans and see which one you like the best.You can build your maze to be as complex or as simple as you would like.  You can add as many pathways or dead ends as you want.  There should be at least one path for your marble to take.  Most of the lines in your maze will be straight.  Make sure each pathway in your maze is wide enough to allow a marble to pass through it.  You can use the flexible parts of the straws to act as curved lines or corners.  It can help to plan your start and end points before adding in your layout.  Once you've decided on the maze layout you like the most, you can begin to draw it on the base of your maze. Having the layout drawn in pencil can help you get a feel for how it will look and function when you add the straws. If everything is to your liking, you can prepare the straws and start building the maze.  You can use a piece of cardboard for a simple maze base.  A flat piece of wood could also be used as a maze base.  You could use a small box to build your maze on.  Any flat surface that you can glue straws onto will serve as a maze base.  Make sure there aren't any bumps or bulges in the maze base, unless you want to add extra challenges to your maze.  You will need a length of straw for every line in your maze. If you have corners in your maze, you might want to use the flexible section of bendable straws to create them. Once you've cut out a piece of straw for each line in your maze, you can begin to build the maze itself. Don't worry if a straw is too long, you can always trim it before you glue it down.  You can also cut straws one at a time, gluing them down as you go.  After you've cut your straws to length and have your maze laid out, you can start to glue the straws down. Gluing the straws in place will help form the walls of your maze, confining the marble to the paths you've created. Take your time and make sure each straw is right where you want it to be.Allow the glue plenty of time to dry before using the maze.  It may be difficult to remove the straws after you've glued them down. Make sure the maze is how you want it before sticking the straws to the maze base.  If your maze base doesn't have any walls, you might add straws around the edge of the maze to keep the marble contained.  Now that you have built the maze walls using the straws, you can label the start and end points. Having the start and end points of the maze labeled can help others know how to properly navigate the maze. This will allow you and your friends to enjoy the challenge of your maze together.Try using different symbols or words for the start and end of the maze.  If you don't have room to write the words “start” and “end”, you could draw a simple shape instead. For example, a small square might indicate the start point of the maze, while a circle marks the end.  You can try adding other markings to indicate “danger zones”. If the marble touches one of these marks, you have to start the maze over again.  Once you've built the maze, all that's left to do is have fun playing with it. Put the marble on your start point, pick the maze up, and tilt the maze to make the marble move. Have fun trying to get the marble from one end of the maze to the other.Try adding new challenges. For example, you might see who can find the fastest way through the maze.  You could try adding another marble to the maze. This marble must be avoided as you navigate your own marble through the maze. If the marbles touch, you have to start over.  ","gather your materials. plan the layout. draw the final layout on the maze base. cut the straws. glue the straws down. label the start and end points. add the marble and play. "

"For example, if you only plan on using your computer for browsing the Internet, save money by purchasing a netbook as opposed to spending extra money on a computer with lots of memory you may never use.;  , This will help you save money on costs for different or upgraded software. For example, if you prefer a computer with the Windows 7 OS, do not buy a computer with Windows XP installed.  Many retail stores and websites will provide you with rebates or discounts on certain computer models.  Visit local retail stores that sell computers and ask about discounts on 'open box' or late-model computers. Open box computers may have been used as floor models, but are in perfect working order; whereas a store may be trying to clear out late-model computers to replace their inventory with newer computer models.  Search online for websites that sell refurbished computers. Refurbished computers are often sold at discounted prices because they have either been repaired by or returned to the manufacturer.  Search for discounted computers on the websites for major retailers such as Amazon, NewEgg, and Crutchfield. Websites such as these usually offer low prices as a result of having mass quantities, and in most cases will save you money by providing you with free or low shipping costs.  If your computer suffers from a manufacturer's defect or similar issue, you can have it replaced or repaired through the manufacturer's warranty, which usually lasts an average of 3 years.  Some retailers may convince you to buy add-ons or extra accessories that you may not need in order to increase their sales numbers; such as memory cards or web cams.

"The triangle should be an isosceles triangle approximately 1 inch (2.5 cm) at the base and 2 inches (5 cm) from the center of the base to the apex.,, Place the match and pin so that the pinpoint touches the match head no higher than the thickest part of the head.  Wrap the foil as tightly around the match head as you can without disturbing the pin. When you’re finished, the wrapping should extend about 1/4 inch (6.25 mm) below the match head.  This will push the wrapping closer to the match head and also better define the channel formed by the pin under the wrapping  , Be careful not to tear the foil when you do this.  Bend the outer bend to a 60-degree angle. This will form the base of the launching pad.  Bend the inner bend upward, then around to form an open-ended triangle. This is where you will rest the foil-wrapped match head.  Again, an open, outdoor location is strongly recommended, as the matchstick rocket can travel a considerable distance. Avoid locations that are exceptionally dry, as the matchstick rocket could start a fire.  Be sure the surrounding area is clear before launching the rocket.  The rocket should rest at least at a 60-degree angle. If it rests any lower, you may have to bend the paper clip until it does.  Light a match and put its flame directly under the wrapped match head. When the phosphorus in the wrapped match head ignites, the matchstick rocket should lift off.  Have a pail of water handy to dunk spent matchstick rockets in to ensure they are completely extinguished.  If a matchstick rocket should land on you, stop moving, drop to the ground, and roll until any flames are extinguished.

"Before you start your club, you’ll have to pick a theme. What is your club about? Take some time to brainstorm and come up with a list of possible topics. Spies, princesses, geeks, pop stars? Remember to think about your club’s purpose. Do you simply want to discuss a topic with like-minded people, or are you putting a plan into action?;  , After you’ve brainstormed, choose an idea that you are truly interested in. Starting the club and keeping it running may turn out to be a lot of work for you, so you’ll want to focus on something that you enjoy.Consider creating a short mission statement that explains exactly what the club is all about. That way you can go to your statement when you are wrapped up in the excitement of explaining it to your friends.For example, “Trebble club is a group of high school students that are dedicated to arranging and performing pop songs from the 1990s to the present.”  , By nature, a club is a group activity with a certain number of participants. Talk to your friends, acquaintances, and other people in your community about your ideas. Ask them if they would be interested in participation and membership.If no one seems interested, try reaching a bit further out of your network. For example, you may have only spoken to your class or your schoolmates. Try reaching out to older or younger students, or contact other schools in the area.  Consider adjusting your idea if you can’t find any members. After several conversations, you should have a better sense of what would be interesting to your peers.  ","brainstorm. choose something you are excited about. gauge the level of interest in your club. "
"Though it sounds harsh, if you're going to hook up with an ex, then you should only hook up with her.  Be honest about it. Don't make an excuse every time your ex wants to go somewhere public with you. Tell her that you're not looking for anything other than hooking up.  Hooking up with your ex can be fun and exciting, but that doesn't mean you should do it every night, because guess what? That's starting to look like a relationship. If you're basically only hooking up with your ex, then you're not letting yourself meet other girls or have any fun on the side. The more time you spend together, the more likely you both are to be hurt, so keep it fun and spontaneous instead of setting a hook-up date for every night of the week.  Keep it fun and spontaneous. If you see her out, then take her home. If not, then don't call her or text her to find out where she is. You're not supposed to care that much, remember?  , It can be tricky to hook up with an ex without feeling too comfortable.  No cuddling, no passionate kisses as you leave, and no hanging out around the house in sweatpants eating cold nachos from the night before. All of these signs show that you're too comfortable in the non-relationship and that you're on your way to dating again.  If you want to hook up with your ex without any trouble, then you have to maintain control of the situation at all times. Don't let her set the terms of your hook up, and try to keep things at her place so you remain the master of your own domain. Don't cancel your plans to hang out with your buddies if she wants to hang out; tell her you'll hang out with her if she's free.  This doesn't mean you should tell your ex exactly what to do; you should find a time and place that works for both of you, but you shouldn't fall prey to her needs.  Don't hang out with your ex in front of your friends, go to a party with her because she doesn't want to show up alone, or tell your friends that you've been hooking up with her again. The more people you bring into it, the more complicated things will get, and you should keep it simple -- just between the two of you.  If you start going out in public with her and hanging out with her friends, they'll immediately disapprove and tell your ex that she should set the terms for your relationship.  If you bring her out in front of your friends, then she'll start to feel like your girlfriend again.  Maybe when you were dating, you would be tender with your woman, telling her how beautiful she is, how much you love her, and how much you love the little dimples in her cheeks. Well, all of your Romeo-moves have to go out the door at this point, or she'll get the wrong picture. She'll think, 'He said I'm beautiful -- he must still love me,' or 'He ran his hands through my hair -- it has to mean something.' By doing this, you'll be leading her on and making her feel like you still want to date her.  You can tell her how hot she is and how much you love her body, but stick to the sexy -- not the tender -- compliments if you want it to last.  ","make sure you only hook up. hook up sparingly. don't get too comfortable. stay in control. keep your new relationship private. avoid 'lovey dovey' stuff when you're hooking up. "

"Don't have cleavage because that will be uncomfortable for your coach and team.;  , Look confident out there! You've got your armor underneath anyway.  It will be easier to get to the most accurate weight; it may be awkward but it tells all the other girls at the tournament that you are serious. Choose really good quality sports underwear so that it feels as if you're wearing a swimsuit.  Everyone is doing the same thing. Even if it is tougher for you (because girls naturally have less muscle and more body fat), complaining is just annoying and it makes you look bad.  You are all equal.  Some guys will take advantage of any show of fear. Show only determination to succeed.  Don't let what other guys might say get to you. If they say something like, 'You're not tough enough' just think: 'I'm tougher than all of them by being the only girl and doing this sport!' Be yourself, and they will respect you and treat you like one of the team.  If you have a negative mind, saying things such as 'I'm going to lose' or 'I'm going to get my butt kicked', chances are that's exactly what will happen. Instead, have a positive mind, and say 'I'm going to beat him!'.  Act tough and make it clear you want to be there. Don't complain.  Of course, this doesn't mean to ignore any pain you're in; get physical injuries attended to promptly.  Aim to get really good. Always try to improve, and try to master a few key moves.  Use the additional time to practice on shooting or moves you don't need a partner for.  Look for patterns or tricks they have and rely upon. It's a window into the future when you understand their typical moves and approaches.  Even take notes if it helps you to remember.  Physically speaking, guys have more upper body strength than most girls do, and it takes a lot to gain that strength, especially for most girls. Work hard, lift weights, do push ups etc.  While lots of guys will be stronger than you, you can win matches if you are fitter (and faster) than they are. Many girls have better cardio than the guys they wrestle.Work hard to survive the first few minutes of your match and then concentrate on weakening your opponent. Time is on the side of the fittest wrestler.  As your opponent begins to fade, switch over to offense. Try to force your opponent to make a mistake that you can exploit.  Pinning is winning. Even if you are behind on points, you can set up a game-changing pin if your opponent becomes too tired to defend themselves.  You still want to beat her even though she is a female. It doesn't matter, boy or girl don't treat them any differently. You are there to be the best at it.  It is nice to have a bond with a few if not all of your team mates, so you will fit in better and be a stronger team. Your team will eventually become like family to you, even if you start off not knowing anyone.  You want your team to be as good as possible, even if they are better than you.  Don't talk to your competition too much, or to members of their team. By all means ask them questions such as 'what's your record?', 'What's your weight?', 'How have you been doing?' and so forth, but do not make buddies with they will take advantage of that and you may well lose.  Approach them and ask if you can speak in private. Explain your concerns with clear examples of why you think you are being treated unequally. Remember that coaches are there to support you!  ","wear under-armor under your t-shirt, or tuck your shirt in so it doesn't go up while wrestling. don't be embarrassed to wear a singlet. when weighing in, if you are allowed to, just go down to your bra and underwear. keep a good attitude and don't complain. be prepared to do the same thing the guys too. show no fear while out there on the mat. don't be beat before you wrestle in a match. don't expect any special treatment from the coach just because you're a girl. practice the wrestling moves. come early to practices. watch the other opponents you'll be wrestling with intense studiousness. work out hard. improve your fitness levels. if you wrestle another girl in a match wrestle as if she's also a guy. hang out with your teammates. help out other less experienced wrestlers, and get help from better wrestlers. be circumspect around opposing teams. if you think that you are being treated unequally by your teammates or by your coaches because you are a girl, have a talk with your coach.

"A slide is supposed to be a continuous sound. You pick the note, holding down your finger, then slide up or down the neck while you can still hear the first note. You should hear the pitch of the note move with your finger -- getting higher if you move towards your body and lower if you move away.  A slide is noted on a tab by a slash. Slides down are forward slashes (/) and slides up are backslashes (\). For example, a slide from the 3rd fret to the 5th, and then back, is noted by '3/5\3.';  , Make sure you use your fingertips to fret, as they are more precise and harder than your fleshy finger pads. You need to hold the note down hard, but still lightly enough that you can slide down the string.  Start slow -- slide from one fret to the other, focus on keeping the note playing the whole time.  Newer strings are always easier to slide on than older ones. Fresh strings are almost always worth it.  If you see a tab with a / before a fret, with no number before the slash, this means you just slide into the note from anywhere. In the above lick, you can slide into the third note for a classy, smooth entrance to the solo.  Slides to the 3rd note or the flat 5th note are often the most bluesy places you can start moving. By '3rd note,' this means the 3rd note in your pentatonic scale. The flat 5th is the blues note located between the 3rd and 4th notes in the pentatonic scale. The notes are bolded below, in the key of A.  e|---------------------5-8-9--------------|  B|--------------------5-8-----------------  G|----------------5-7-8-------------------|  D|---------5-7----------------------------|  A|-----5-6-7-----------------------------|  E|-5-8------------------------------------|  , You can slide power chords, single notes, or even double note sets. Try, for example, sliding the 3rd fret on the bottom two strings (the thinnest ones), down to the 4th fret and back up. This little slide fits nicely in the key of E-blues, and you should get used to little slides down here for bluesy accent notes.  ","fret a note, play it, and slide to another fret without picking up your fingers. keep your finger pressing down hard against the string for the entire slide. slide into notes for a smooth start to a solo. aim for slides on your 3rd and flat 5th notes for extra bluesy playing. know that you can slide across multiple strings.

"Mix equal parts of water and vinegar in a spray bottle. Thoroughly spray the dented or flattened area of carpet. Make sure to cover the whole area with liquid, but don't saturate the carpet so that it’s soaking wet.Make sure the spray bottle is clean and free of other cleaners or chemicals before you use it.;  , Give the mixture time to work on the fibers of the carpet. Depending on how deep and flat the dents are, adjust how long you let the mixture work. Give it at least ten minutes, or wait about half an hour for deep impressions.  Vinegar is often used as a cleaning solution, so the area you spray may end up cleaner than the rest of your carpet.  Grab a clean, white towel and gently press it into the wet carpet. Blot at the carpet until the majority of the liquid has been soaked up. Don’t press too hard or you’ll flatten the carpet out again.  It’s important to use a white towel so that you don’t bleed any color onto your carpet.  Hold a spoon so the edge is against the area of carpet you’re fluffing. Pressing the spoon into the carpet, scrape it across the carpet in straight lines. This will cause the carpet fibers to spring up straight again.If a spoon doesn’t give you the results you hope for, try combing the carpet with the tines of a fork.  Also try a brush with stiff but non-metal bristles to even the carpet out when the dent is gone. A boar's hair brush works well.  After you’ve fluffed the carpet, make sure you don’t walk on it before it is dry. Also be sure not to put any furniture back on the spot while it is wet. This could take 2-3 hours or more depending on the size of the area.  ","spray the affected carpet areas with vinegar and water. let the cleaner sit on the carpet for 10-30 minutes. blot up the liquid with a towel. scrape the carpet with the edge of a spoon. allow the carpet to dry before you walk or put anything on it.

"Spread out the branches to attach to the tree as you go after cleaning each piece. You may wish to place a sheet on the floor around the tree to catch any falling debris., Use an upholstery bristle brush attachment to test an area at the very base of the tree. Your vacuum should be able to safely clean the dirt off the branches without damaging the tree.  You can also use a hand vacuum if you want a weaker suction and don’t wish to deal with a long tube or cords.  Work from the top to the bottom, using your vacuum brush to gently suction dust off the branches and the trunk of the tree. Avoid vacuuming the tree into the hose or pulling out greenery.Don't allow any parts of the branches to be sucked into the hose. The broken pieces could damage your vacuum cleaner.  Fill a bucket with mild dish soap and warm water, avoiding any harsh chemicals that can damage your tree. Unplug your tree if it has built-in lights. Use a soft dish or dust rag to clean the tree so the cloth won’t get tangled in the branches., Dip your rag in the soapy water and wring well. Use the rag to gently clean the tree, working from top to bottom. Rinse the dust off your rag frequently to prevent spreading wet dust to other parts of the tree.Replace the water as necessary.  If you are leaving suds, your towel is dripping, or you're leaving wet branches behind, you are not wringing the rag enough.  Allow the tree to dry thoroughly before plugging the lights back in.  Vacuum the area around the tree to remove any dust that may have fallen on the floor. Put your cleaning supplies away.  Fold the corners of your dust sheet in towards the center. This will form a sack to transport the sheet without spilling any contained dirt.

"Any coconut oil will work, whether it's labeled for hair or cooking. There are many types, however, so use this guide to find a quality oil:A *'virgin,' 'extra-virgin,' or 'unrefined' label means the coconut oil has no added chemicals. A high quality virgin coconut oil should be pure white when solid, and clear when liquid.  A 'refined' or unlabeled product has probably gone through an industrial process. There are high- and low-quality examples, but they are difficult to evaluate without researching the brand. These tend to have a more mild scent.;  , Either type of oil can be extracted from the coconut in one of several ways. This is a little technical, and you can skip it without much harm done. For those interested in finding the perfect brand, here's a breakdown:  'Centrifuged' oils tend to have a more mild scent, and little risk of damage.  'Expeller-pressed' or 'cold-pressed' oils range from mild to strong scented. Low-quality examples may have heat damage, which cause unpleasant burnt scents.  'Direct Micro Expelled' (DME) oil tends to be high-quality, and created directly by coconut farmers. This may be difficult to find.  Virgin coconut oil melts at 76ºF (24ºC), so in temperate weather it may already melt as you apply it to your hair.If you prefer handling liquid oil, spoon about 2–3 tablespoons (30–45mL) coconut oil into a bowl. Place the bowl in a larger container and pour hot tap water into the larger container, until it reaches halfway up the bowl. The oil should turn liquid within a few minutes.  Do not microwave the oil. While this probably won't make it less effective, it can make the oil dangerously hot., Knots and tangles will make applying the oil more difficult., As a pre-wash conditioner, coconut oil reduces hygral fatigue, or swollen, damaged hair caused by water exposure. It may also reduce damage caused by brushing and heat-treating wet hair.Massage a small amount of coconut oil onto the roots of your hair, and drag it down throughout all your hair. Make sure you use an old towel and no clothes as coconut oil stains clothes and towels. Leave the oil in for 10–20 minutes first to treat damaged hair as well. Keep it under a shower cap or plastic bag to prevent dripping and keep it warm. Wash and condition your hair as usual.  Although your hair will be more resistant to damage, it won't be invulnerable. When convenient, avoid brushing and heat-drying wet hair to reduce damage.  As a leave-in conditioner, coconut oil reduces damage caused by brushing or handling wet hair, and adds shine.Start with a pea-sized amount, and saturate the ends. Work your way up, adding a light layer to the middle and nothing at all to the roots.Add a little more if necessary, but not so much that your hair feels greasy. Leave this in as long as you like.  This technique will restore some strength to chemically treated hair, heat-damaged hair, and dry Afro-textured hair.If you have frizzy hair, this will tame your curls in the short term. However, since coconut oil penetrates the hair, your hair will frizz again over time. Mineral oil is more effective for this purpose, although it will not restore strength., A heavy application of coconut oil can restore strength and shine to dry, damaged hair. About once a week or whenever convenient, set aside some time for a big treatment. To start out, rub in the oil with your fingers, or dip a pastry brush into liquid oil. Massage it over all of your hair, focusing on dry or damaged areas.  If you have thick or long hair, section it first and apply the oil in sections.  After a heavy application, tie your hair up and keep it under a shower cap, plastic bag, or plastic wrap.  Optionally, use a thermal cap or a steamer for 10–30 minutes to increase absorption.You may also need a plastic cap to prevent burning and heat damage.  Coconut oil might be the best oil ever at soaking into your hair. After just one hour, your hair can absorb about 15% of its weight in oil. If you have severely damaged hair, leave the oil in for six hours to increase this to about 25%., After you're finished with the heavy application, wash your hair twice and use conditioner to remove all the oil from your scalp and hair. The absorbed coconut oil will remain inside the hair shaft, protecting it from further damage.  Rubbing in coconut oil can be highly effective at fighting certain types of scalp infections, called dermatophytes.Symptoms include a swollen scalp, abscesses on the scalp, or hair loss that leaves black dots of broken hair on the scalp.Always talk to a doctor first when dealing with a serious medical problem. Talk to a doctor first if you already apply medication to your scalp.  If you have head lice and prescription treatment (permethrin) has failed to get rid of them, a spray of coconut and anise may do the trick.As always, a conversation with your doctor is a good first step.  Although some people use coconut oil for dandruff, this is generally a bad idea. Dandruff is usually caused by fungus that feeds on your scalp's natural oils. Adding more natural oil may just increase the food supply.Try a mineral oil instead, or other treatments.  ","select virgin or refined coconut oil. check the label for extraction information. melt the oil (optional). brush your hair. prevent water damage. prevent tearing. restore strength and shine. tie up your hair. add heat (optional). leave the oil in for 1–8 hours. wash your hair. fight scalp infections with coconut oil. apply coconut anise sprays to head lice. avoid using coconut oil to treat dandruff.

"Friendsgiving should be a low-key affair. There’s no need to seat your friends in a formal seating arrangement or use a seating chart to decide who sits where. When your friends come in, say, “Make yourself comfortable and sit wherever you’d like. We’ll eat soon.”If some of your friends don’t know your other friends, introduce them and share something about each with the other that would be of interest to them.  For instance, if your friends Joe and Susan don’t know one another, say to Joe, “This is Susan. She is an astronaut.” Then turn to Susan and say, “This is Joe. He writes about astronauts.”  , As the host, you’ll be responsible for ensuring your guests all have enough to drink. You probably already know your friends’ drinking habits, but if you don’t you could just ask them at some point before the friendsgiving what they like to drink. If your friends don’t drink much (or at all), then you don’t need to have much. But if your friends like drinking during dinner parties and get-togethers, provide an appropriate amount and variety of booze.If you find the cost excessive, you could also ask each of your guests to bring a bottle of wine or a six-pack of beer along with their dish.In addition to alcohol, of course, your friendsgiving should have soda, water, and juice available for people who don’t want to drink.  Don’t forget to stock up on ice for both alcoholic and nonalcoholic drinks.  All the dishes should be placed on the table and passed around, or arranged on the kitchen counter for buffet-style self-service. If your food is arranged on the counter, fold a notecard in half along its vertical axis, then turn it sideways to create a small sign. Write the name of the dish and the name of the person who made it on each card., After dinner, invite your friends to join in card games like 21, poker, or hearts. You and your guests might also enjoy a rousing round of Trivial Pursuit or charades. Think about what sorts of activities you and your friends enjoy and provide the opportunities to do them at your house.To keep the friendsgiving in the spirit of Thanksgiving, you could provide everyone with a small piece of note paper and a pen and invite them to anonymously write something they’re thankful on the notepad and drop it in a jar. During or after the meal, pull out the pieces of paper and read what each person is thankful for.You could also take an informal vote among your friends for the best dish of the night. Don’t vote for yourself!, If you have anything left over at the end of the night, invite each of your guests to take some leftovers with them in resealable containers or plastic bags. This will ensure they have a little something for the road.You might also be able to obtain some disposable takeout containers from certain restaurants. Just approach the restaurant managers and ask if you could have a set of eight or 10 takeout containers and lids for your friendsgiving.  If you’re having fun, your guests will, too. Even if some small inconvenience occurs – a friend spills their wine on the table, or drops gravy on the carpet – just stay cool and don’t let it get to you. Instead, focus on the big picture – you and your friends are enjoying a great meal, great conversation, and having great fun together.  ","let your guests seat themselves. provide alcohol. dig in. schedule some activities. send leftovers home with your guests. have a good time. "
"If you are using a cigarillo-sized hand roller, you will need approximately two-to-three grams of tobacco. The exact amount will be determined by the size of your wrap and personal preference.  Hand rollers come in several different cigarette, cigarillo, and cigar sizes.  Each of these rollers functions the same way.  A hand roller has two rolling pins: one that slides and one that remains fixed. To open the hand roller you will need to slide the proper rolling pin to the side.  This will expose the filling chamber.  Be careful not to use too much or else the rolling pins will jam. Do your best to evenly distribute the tobacco throughout the chamber for a nice and even smoke.  Slide the rolling pin back to its original position to close the hand roller. Don't worry about any tobacco tips that may be protruding from the rolling pins, these will be pulled in once you begin the rolling process.  Roll the non-sliding pin downward until it has rotated at least one-full time.  The more times you roll the pin, the thinner and denser--more packed--the cigarillo will be.  Cigarillos that have been over packed may be difficult to draw from.  If the wrap you are using has an adhesive strip (used to seal the cigarillo), be sure to place the strip at the top and make sure that it faces toward the non-sliding rolling pin.  Like you did when you were first packing the tobacco, gently rotate the non-sliding rolling pin downward. The cigarillo wrap will be pulled into the hand roller as you roll. Stop rolling when only the very edge of the wrap or adhesive strip is exposed.  You can lick the wrap directly, or you can moisten your finger and run it along the edge.  Once you can't see any more of the wrap, go ahead and rotate the rolling pin one full rotation.  Remember to roll the pin that does not slide open.  Your cigarillo will need a few minutes for it to properly 'stick' to itself and seal. Once it is dry it is ready to be smoked.  To roll a cigarette, simply use cigarette paper instead of a tobacco leaf or wrap.  If you are rolling a cigarette, you can choose to roll with or without a filter.  ","prepare your tobacco. slide the rolling pin up and out. fill the roller with tobacco. close the hand roller. pack the cigarillo by rotating the rolling pin. insert the cigarillo wrap into the hand roller by placing it between the two rolling pins. rotate the rolling pin downward. moisten the edge or adhesive strip. continue rotating the rolling pin downward until the entire wrap has been pulled in. open the hand roller the way you did in step two.

"You can do this by covering them with parchment paper or by coating them with nonstick cooking spray., You can do this with an electric mixer or a food processor with whisk attachments. You can even beat the butter by hand using an ordinary whisk, but it will take much longer. Keep whisking until the sugar is mixed evenly throughout the butter.  If you are vegan, use 'vegan butter' instead.  Combine 1 tablespoon (7 grams) of ground flax seed with 2½ to 3 tablespoons (37.5 to 45 milliliters) of warm water. Whisk the mixture until smooth, then let it sit for 5 minutes., Keep stirring until the flax egg and vanilla extract are mixed evenly throughout the beaten sugar-butter., Mixing your dry ingredients separately helps everything mix together evenly. If you do it all at once, you're more likely to get streaks of unmixed ingredients., As you mix, the ingredients will start to pull together to form a sticky dough. Keep mixing until everything is evenly combined., Be careful not to over-mix, or the dough will be too soft. The dough should ready be well-blended, so all you need to do is fold the oats, nuts, and raisins into the dough until they are evenly distributed., You can also use an ice cream scoop instead. Make sure that they are spaced 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) apart, as they will spread a little while baking., You can do this using a drinking glass or the palm of your hand. Don't worry if the cookies look too thick; they will continue to flatten and spread while they are being baked., They are ready when the edges turn a golden brown color. The centers should be still moist., Use a spatula to transfer the cookies from the baking sheet to the wire rack so that you don't break them or burn yourself.

"Depending on where you live, there is likely a short-term loan office in your area. Look for businesses with things like “Payday Loan” or “Currency Exchange” in their names. Search the internet or a local phone book to locate the office in your area, and visit them during business hours.  Once you meet with a short-term loan representative, you will be asked to verify your identity. Depending on the establishment, you may be asked to provide either one or two forms of I.D. A state I.D., driver’s license, birth certificate, or passport are great options., Rather than checking your credit rating, most short-term loans are awarded based on your ability to repay. This means that you must verify your employment status and income. You may use either current paystubs or bank statements to verify your employment and income., This particular practice will vary from establishment to establishment, but in general, you will also be asked to write a post-dated check to the short-term loan office. This check acts as a form a insurance that you will repay your loan., Once you have verified your identity, verified your employment, and written the post-dated check, you will be ready to receive your loan. Many lenders offer to wire the money directly into your bank account. Other establishments will write you a money order, that you will need to cash., As mentioned above, short-term loans tend to have strict repayment plans. Typically, the borrower is expected to repay the loan in person on their next payday. If the borrower does not repay the loan on time, the lender may roll over the loan, adding more fees, or redeem the post-dated check.

"The CDC recommends that healthy adults aim for a certain amount of physical activity each week to maintain or even improve health. Playing a sport is a fun way to do this.  Most health professionals recommend that you do at least 150 minutes of aerobic activity each week.Aim for this amount between your practices and games.  This goal is easy to meet when you play a sport. For example, one soccer game may be an hour long. That's not even including the practices.  In addition, many sports require you to have a higher level of aerobic fitness. During practices or games, you'll most likely be alternating between high and moderate intensity activity which is great for your cardiovascular system.Tally up the total time you know you'll spend each week playing games, participating in events and going to practice. If it meets the 150 minute guideline, you don't have to be active outside of your team sport.;  , You may not think that playing a sport could help you meet the CDC's guidelines for strength training. However, many sports require strength training to get better or they may even include strength training in the practices.  Participating in team sports and their practices can help you meet the guidelines of having one to two days of total body strength training.Make sure between practices that you participate in strength training exercises for at least 20 minutes per session.  Sports that require bursts of running - like soccer, football or basketball will require strong leg muscles. In addition, sports like basketball or baseball require a good amount of upper body strength.  Practices may involve doing lunges, squats or burpees which can help strengthen and tone your muscles.  Again, practices should involve some strength training focusing on your back, shoulders, core, buttocks, legs, and arm muscles.  Like many forms of physical activity, a team sport can help you maintain a healthier weight and it may even help you lose weight. Use this fun and social form of activity to help you achieve your weight loss goals as well.Be consistent with all the practices, games or events plus do additional training on your own. This will help you stick to a more routine exercise schedule and meet those recommended weekly guidelines. Over time, this is a great support for weight loss.If you're trying to lose weight, set a realistic goal. Even when participating in a lot of physical activity, it's still recommended to aim for a one to two pound weight loss per week.In addition, see if the entire team would be interested in following a healthier diet together. Together everyone will be active and eating well as a unit which can make following a diet or particular lifestyle much easier., Whether you smoke or drink larger quantities of alcohol, these unhealthy lifestyle behaviors can have a negative effect on your body and athletic performance. To stick to a routine practice schedule and to pull your weight on the team, you need to make sure that your lifestyle is healthy.  To start, quit smoking if you do. You need to be able to breathe easily and work your cardiovascular system and lungs at a high level. Give up smoking so that you can successfully improve your aerobic fitness levels.  Limit your alcohol consumption as well. Men shouldn't drink more than two beverages a day and women should limit their intake to one drink daily.Remember that playing sports are only one way to boost your physical health. You'll enjoy their benefits more if you extend your healthy habits in sports to other areas of your life  , Just as smoking or alcohol consumption can work against your sports performance, so can an unhealthy diet. Change what you eat and how you eat to support your athletic performance.Poor diet choices may lead to poor performance. You may be more fatigued or not be able to keep up during practice.  Skip foods like: fried foods, fast foods, processed foods, sweets, sugary beverages and alcohol.  Instead, focus on eating lean protein, fruits, vegetables and whole grains. A well balanced and nutrient dense diet will help fuel you through tough practices and help your body recover.  Studies have shown that there is a positive correlation between sleep quality and exercise.Playing a team sport can help you get in the activity you need to get a solid night's rest.  When you exercise for at least 150 minutes per week (the recommended amount), you're able to fall asleep quicker, have a deeper and more restful sleep and sleep longer.  A team sport is a great way to meet those activity guidelines and get you tired out enough to get a great night's rest.  It's important to aim for at least seven to nine hours of sleep every night. This is needed for daily functioning, but also to make sure you're at your best for practices and events.To get this amount, try going to bed earlier or waking up later if you can.  Some studies have shown that regular participation in a team sport can help boost your self-esteem and confidence both on and off the field.If you have self-esteem or confidence issues, use your team sport to help strengthen those areas. Regular practice on the field or court can help you build strength, endurance and a mastery of certain skills. This can help boost your confidence in your own abilities.  Consider keeping a journal to track your abilities when you first start a sport and every month as you play.  You may also want to track how your body has changed as you get stronger, tone muscles or even lose weight. You can track your weight or take measurements of your waist or hips.  Exercise is a common method to help you relax, de-stress and unwind from a long day. But hanging out with your teammates is another great way to relax and de-stress.Use time off the field with your teammates as a source of support. Your fellow mates can be a support group and be a good place for you to vent and release stress.  Consider going out for a drink or a meal after a practice or a game. You can chat and relax among friends. It's a great way to bond off the field. Just remember to eat clean and limit your alcohol intake.  Schedule an event to see a movie together as a team. You could all grab dinner before or after and hang out while watching a good film.  Celebrate special occasions together as well. If it's your birthday or another team member's one year anniversary on the team, celebrate together.  When you exercise, you'll often notice your stress levels decrease; however, when we stop exercising, it's often easy not to notice how our stress begins to mount again. In the case of exercise, seeing is believing; even at times when motivating yourself to stay active is a pain, you'll find that doing exercise often overrides this feeling by alleviating stress once again.  Playing a team sport is a great way to not only meet new people, but spend quality time with old friends. Use your time during practice and games to get to know each other and bond more closely.  Consider asking your friends to join a sports team with you or make up your own team among a group of your friends.  Schedule in weekly practices and events that will work for everyone's schedule. That way, that social time will be a bit easier to fit into a busy lifestyle.  If you're interested in making new friends, joining a team sport is a great idea. You'll meet a whole new group of people and have the opportunity to really get to know one another.  If you're not currently playing a team sport, but would like to start, look for local teams in your area. Talk to friends, family or do a little digging online to see what's available.  To start, consider what type of sport you'd like to play. Have you played something in the past? Did you play a sport in high school or college?  Ask your co-workers if there's an office league or ask friends if they know of any local sports teams.  Another good place to look is online. Look at your local YMCA, churches or fitness centers. These places may all have a local team.  If you cannot find a local team sport or can't find something you'd like to play, consider starting your own team sport. This can be a fun activity to start.  Just because you can't find an established team, doesn't mean that there aren't any options.  Ask co-workers, especially if you work in a bigger office, if they'd like to start up a team.  Send out an email and see what sports people would like to try and if they'd be willing to join together to form a team.  You can also try getting your friends or family members together. It's a great way to socialize and bond as well as get in some physical activity.  If you're thinking you can't join a team sport because you're not very athletic or not very good at sports, don't worry. There are options for everyone with or without previous experience.  You don’t need to be skilled at a sport. There are very casual, 'no-skills' required sports that are great for people of all skill levels.  For example, sports like dodgeball, kickball or casual flag football are just for fun.  Also, remember that with time and regular practice, you will get better at whatever team sport you try. Just keep trying and working on your skills.  After you've decided on a team sport, you need to make sure that you prepare yourself and get the right equipment. This will help you stay safe and have fun.  Many sports require some sort of athletic shoe. You may need cleats for soccer or high tops for basketball. Ask the team lead or other players what type of shoes you need.  Also consider getting a gym towel and water bottle. You'll definitely be working up a sweat and need to wipe your brow and cool down with some water.  Ask the team whether or not there is specialty clothing. Most times, general athletic clothing will work (gym shorts and a t-shirt). However you may need to purchase a team jersey for events and games.  ","meet the recommended aerobic activity guidelines. incorporate the recommended amount of strength training. use sports to maintain a healthy weight. ditch unhealthy lifestyle habits. eat a well-balanced and nutritious diet. sleep at least seven to nine hours each night. track your performance and progress to help improve your self-esteem. hang out with your teammates outside of games and practices. stay consistent with your practice schedule. improve social ties. research local sports teams. start your own team. try less competitive sports. get the right equipment.

"This is absolutely essential. You can't just pick up a violin and play it straight away, it takes a substantial amount of time to learn and you will likely need several years experience before you can tackle complicated songs.;  , You can learn songs by ear but it's better if you can read the actual notes.Note: Only treble clef is used in violin music.  Buy books of sheet music in music shops (make sure it's for violin though), or try the internet. Also try learning by ear.  If you're a beginner, try nursery rhymes. (You'll probably do this if you have proper lessons anyway.)  Although they aren't really songs as such, you can learn a lot from playing classical music. (Again, the kind of things you'll likely do in lessons, if you have them.)  Country music would be a good idea to play as violins are often used.  Same goes for pop; you will often hear some violins in amongst the guitar, bass and synthesizers.  You could try rock and metal, but usually these kind of genres' music focuses much more on guitars. However, if you really want to play rock/metal songs on violin and have had a good few years experience, consider learning a bit about guitars and guitar tabs; this will open the door to a world of online tabs which you should be able to adapt for violin with some knowledge and skill.  ","learn to play the violin. learn to read music. look for songs to play. have fun! "
"Butter lettuce is a great choice for a breadless sandwich and requires little preparation. Choose a piece that doesn’t have too many holes, give it a rinse and then dry it in a salad spinner or with a clean towel. Throw your sandwich ingredients in the middle and then wrap it up., You can get green swiss chard or a rainbow swiss chard, which will add beautiful colors like yellow, orange and pink to your sandwich. Show off your healthy sandwich by choosing rainbow swiss chard. It also tastes great and, like lettuce, can be used raw. Throw your ingredients inside, wrap and enjoy., If you choose a sturdy green such as collards, kale or cabbage, it is best to blanch it first. Throw it in hot water for thirty seconds and then dunk it in cold water. You want to choose a leaf that looks fairly intact and doesn’t have too many holes., The next time you grill up a burger, try using portobello mushrooms instead of the bun. You will boost your fiber and eliminate the simple carbohydrates. Chop off the stems of the portobello mushrooms, wash and then throw them on the grill with your burgers. You will need two mushrooms per burger., If you are trying to cut carbohydrates from your sandwich, try using slices of jicama instead of bread. Jicama tastes like a potato but is slightly sweeter and has more water. Wash and then peel the jicama. Slice it into quarter inch slices and replace each piece of bread with one slice of jicama.If you are making tacos, you could use Jicama instead of the tacos. Instead of slicing the jicama, scoop out the middle and then throw the taco ingredients in the middle., Wash, peel and slice up a cucumber. You should cut the cucumber into quarter inch slices. Replace each piece of bread with one piece of cucumber. Since there is a fairly small surface area, you may need to make a couple cucumber sandwiches for each of the bread sandwiches you had planned to make., Decide which protein you want to use for your breadless sandwich and then prepare it. If you use cooked, shredded chicken breast, you can go right ahead and throw it on your breadless wrap. If you choose a can of tuna or salmon, you will need to drain it and then mix it with a teaspoon of mayonnaise, salt and pepper. Beans will need to be drained, and then can be added directly to the wrap., Remember that most substitutes for bread will absorb less moisture, so you may need to adjust your usual condiment choices. For instance, you may want to avoid condiments with a lot of water content, since they may make a bit of a mess. Choose thicker condiments like tahini, as opposed to watery condiments like greek dressing., You will want to be a bit conservative in terms of the amount of ingredients you throw inside, which should be proportional to the size of the leaf. Start by throwing in your protein. Next, choose a crunchy vegetable or seed such as shredded carrots, slivered almonds, sprouts, cucumber sticks or shredded carrots. Then, you will want something creamy such as yogurt or tahini. Finally, throw in something to boost the flavor a bit such as mustard or hot sauce. Finally, roll up the wrap like you would a burrito. Roll it horizontally, moving away from you.  ","try wrapping your sandwich fillings in butter lettuce. pick swiss chard for your breadless sandwich. choose a leafy green for your breadless sandwich. swap grilled portobello mushrooms for hamburger buns. use jicama instead of bread. slice up a cucumber. choose your protein wisely. pick your condiments. assemble your breadless sandwich.

"Soldering will not succeed if too much heat is lost to the air or work surface, so you will need to find a specialized surface with low heat conduction. A charcoal soldering block may be the best option for soldering silver, as it reflects heat to create the high temperature silver requires.A magnesia soldering block or a kiln break are other common options, and may last through more soldering projects than charcoal.  These can be purchased at craft stores or jewelry supply stores, and are similar in size and shape to an ordinary building brick.;  , Silver solder is an alloy formed from silver and other metals, designed to join with silver but melt at a lower temperature. You may purchase this as a container of pre-cut chips, or purchase it in sheet or wire form and cut off 1/8 inch (3mm) chips with wire cutters.Do not attempt to use lead solder when soldering silver, as it will usually fail to work and is difficult to remove.Warning: Avoid silver solders containing cadmium, which may cause health problems if fumes are inhaled.  If you are filling a crack, you may want to use a lower-purity 'easy' silver solder, as it melts at a lower temperature. For joining two pieces together, use 'medium' or 'hard' silver solder with more silver content, to create a stronger bond.Note that there is no industry-wide definition for these terms; if you are switching brands and want results similar to what you're used to, look at the percentage of silver content instead.  Do not use a soldering iron, as these are intended for use with lower temperature lead solder and may ruin precious metals. Purchase a small oxy-acetylene torch instead from the hardware store, preferably with a flat 'chisel tip' rather than a pointed one.Silver quickly conducts heat away from the location exposed tot he flame. Because of this, a small torch tip may make the soldering go much more slowly., A 'flux' is necessary to clean the silver's surface and assist in heat transfer. It also helps remove oxides on the silver's surface, which would interfere with the bond. You may use a general purpose flux, or a 'blazing flux' specifically for silver or jewelry.  'Brazing' flux is used for high temperature joining, in which the surface of the metal objects themselves are chemically altered. While even jewelers refer to this process as 'soldering' instead, 'brazing' is technically the correct term.It doesn't matter which form of flux you purchase. (For instance, paste or liquid.)  , Open the windows or turn on a fan in order to minimize the amount of fumes you inhale, moving the air over the work area and away from you. Keep strong breezes away from the object itself, however, or their cooling effect may make the soldering process difficult., Copper tongs are recommended, as they can handle high heat and will not corrode and ruin the pickling solution described below. Tweezers are useful for holding the silver objects in place, although these can be made from any metal.  Safety goggles are essential to protect your eyes from accidental spatter, since you may need to look closely at the joint.A denim or canvas apron minimizes the chance of burning your clothing.  Avoid loose or dangling clothing. Pull back long sleeves and tie back long hair before you begin working.  You'll need a container of water to rinse off the silver at the end of the process. Make sure this is deep enough to dip the silver object.  Purchase a 'pickle,' or acidic solution used in soldering, specifically labeled for its suitability for silver. These usually come in powder form. Right before you begin soldering, dissolve the powder in water and use a crock pot or specialized 'pickle pot' to heat it according to the manufacturer's instructions.  Do not use a crock pot, microwave, or oven that you intend to use again for cooking. The pickle may leave behind a metallic smell or even trace amounts of toxic materials. Never put steel in contact with pickle.  Most prepared pickle solutions can keep for several weeks., A degreasing solution is recommended for oily or heavily handled silver.If there is oxidization on the surface, you may need to place the silver in a pickle solution before soldering. Optionally, you may use 1000 grit sandpaper to make a rougher surface for joining., Prepare the flux according to instructions on the packaging, if it is not ready to use. Use a small paintbrush to apply this flux onto the silver object(s). Some people apply flux only where the solder will be present, in order to limit the amount of solder that flows to the wrong place. Others prefer to apply the flux over a larger area to minimize the risk of fire damage, but this is not recommended for beginners.Using a small amount of flux in a separate container is recommended, as repeatedly dipping a brush into the original bottle may add dirt and affect its function.  Lay the two components next to each other on the soldering brick. Position them exactly as you want them to be joined, noting that they must be physically touching to be joined properly.  Use a pair of tweezers to pick up a solder chip and gently place it on one end of the crack or gap to be joined. Once melted, the solder will be drawn by the heat anywhere flux was applied, so you do not need to cover the entire length of the gap., Light your torch and adjust the heat to its highest setting. Begin by holding the torch about 4 inches (10 cm) away from the joint, moving it constantly in small circles to ensure even heating of all components. Slowly move the flame closer to the joint, focusing on the metal objects near the solder, not the solder itself.When the solder reaches its melting point, it will quickly melt and be pulled onto the fluxed areas of the silver.  If one of the objects to be joined is thicker than the other, heat the thicker object from the back until the solder starts to melt, then heat the thin object briefly.Use tweezers if necessary to hold the objects in place, but place them on the far end of the silver, away from the flame. You may need to hold down small, thin areas of the silver to provide a heat sink, preventing the thin area from melting.  Let the object cool for a minute, then cool it further by dipping it into a water bath. The 'pickle' solution described in the work area section is an acidic bath used to clean the jewelry after soldering. Lower the silver into this bath using copper tongs, and leave it for a few minutes to remove the flux and oxidization. Avoid all contact with your skin, clothing, or steel tools, as the pickle bath can be corrosive.  Rinse the newly joined silver with water. Pat dry with a clean cloth. If the process was completed correctly, the silver should remain joined permanently.  ","find a charcoal soldering block or other appropriate work surface. purchase silver solder. use a torch, not a soldering iron. select a general purpose flux or brazing flux. use a fan for ventilation if necessary. find tweezers and copper tongs. take precautions with goggles and an apron. set up a container of water. heat a container of 'pickle.', clean the silver. apply flux to the joint. position your silver components to be joined. position the solder onto the joint. heat the objects until the solder melts. dip the object in water, then immerse it in a pickle solution. rinse the silver.

"The amount of water you place in the glass will affect the pitch of the sound that is created. The more water placed in the glass, the lower-pitched the sound. Conversely, the less water placed in the glass, the higher-pitch the sound.  Fill several more glasses of water to replicate several different musical notes. Such glass-based instruments have been in use for many years!More delicate glasses, such as wine glasses, are not ideal for making percussive sounds. They are fragile, and more prone to breaking when rapped with an object.  Arrange the glasses in a logical musical order. You may choose highest to lowest pitch, lowest to highest, or any order you desire, provided you can remember the order.  Test each glass with a tap from a fork, spoon, pencil, or other implement, as you are adding water. You can pour out or add water as desired to reach just the right pitch.  Dinner utensils are common instruments used to play the glasses. However, pencils, pens, rulers, or even drum sticks can be used to similar effect.  Take care not to hit the glasses too hard. You can end up cracking the glasses, or even breaking it entirely.  Fill 6 glasses with varying amounts of water - between three and a quarter inches all the way up to five and three quarters. Label them numerically, one through six. With just these six glasses, you can play some simple tunes.

"Students who live in dorms often do better academically. It's easier to stay on task with less distractions. If you're on campus, you may also have easier access to places like the library.Be honest with yourself. Are you a responsible person? Will you be able to get to classes on time if you live off campus? Will you be able to stay on track with your homework with the freedom of off-campus life.  If you're generally the responsible type, living off campus will still be an adjustment. However, if you tend to finish assignments on time and have a solid work ethic, you have a good chance of staying on track off campus.  If you move off campus, you may be farther away from things like libraries, resource centers, and similar buildings. If it is more difficult to run to the library, for example, you may find you're doing it less often.  . But if you are living off campus, you might have more entertainment and socialization options out in the community that would be harder to access while on campus such as movie theaters, restaurants, shopping, etc. These options may be more expensive but you can sometimes get community discounts if you have a campus ID.  A lot of this will depend on where apartments tend to be located in your area. If you're attending school in a college town, apartments may tend to be close to campus. This would make this less of an issue.  You should also factor in the cost of parking and gas. If you end up needing to drive to certain locations, the costs can add up each month.  The freedom of an apartment can be great. You can have guests over whenever you want, and are generally able to make more noise. However, this can prove to be a distraction. In the dorm, there may be things like quiet hours. You also will not be able to have a lot of people over at once.If you're the responsible type, you may be able to better cope with distractions. However, it will always be an adjustment. If you decide to live off campus, be prepared to work extra hard to stay on track.  It's okay if you think you cannot handle the responsibility. Many students live on campus for all four years. Remember, the most important thing about college is learning.  ","be honest about your personal responsibility. think about your access to campus amenities. think about distractions. "
"Make sure that your surroundings are quiet. Studies have shown that background noise may decrease higher brain function, impairing learning and memory.To focus on your book, find quiet by whatever means necessary- try looking for a secluded spot, wearing earplugs, or reading late at night when most people are sleeping.;  , Studies have shown that smartphones are a great distraction, and that the absence of one when completing a task can make you more than 25% more productive.When you are reading, leave your phone in another room, or tucked away in your pocket or book bag to avoid looking at it. If you are not anticipating any urgent calls or messages, try turning it off altogether.  The same principle applies for television. Having it on in the background is likely to disrupt your focus., Everyone has their own ideal working space, where they can concentrate, relax and be productive.If you already know where you feel best, make a point of setting up there to read. If not, try some of these options for relaxed and focused reading:  Library  A basement, attic, or other quiet room at home  A quiet park  A bookstore  A quiet café or restaurant  , Make space for reading in your busy schedule to avoid worrying about other responsibilities, chores, and activities during that time. Choose a point during the day when you will not be needed by family, friends, or colleagues; if possible, let them know that you will be out of touch during that period. Taking time for yourself- for reading, or anything else you might want to do- is important for psychological and physical health.If your schedule allows, make this reading time a regular weekly, or even daily, event.  It has been shown that 30-40 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity can greatly improve cognitive clarity.Before picking up a book to read, try going for a run, brisk walk, or bike ride to clear your mind and improve concentration. Consider bringing a book along with you for these types of workouts so that you can read whenever you need a rest.  Healthy foods can raise energy levels, and thus improve your ability to concentrate throughout the day. Snacks should contain fibre-rich carbohydrates or Omega-3 fats, which can also support memory and concentration.Try stocking up on some of these snacks for your reading time:  Nuts  Fruit  Oatmeal  Pumpkin seeds  Peanut butter  Anything with whole grains  , Studies have shown that getting a sufficient amount of sleep is key for good concentration and memory.Sleepiness can slow down thought processes, increase irritability, and disrupt learning, thereby interfering with your ability to focus on a book. Try to get between 7-9 hours of sleep a night, as is recommended for most adults., Book reviews provide a brief summary, evaluation, and assessment of a book.Look up online reviews of the book you're reading to spark your enthusiasm about it; if the reviews are bad, read the book with the intention of finding positive aspects that surpass the reviewer's opinion. Try to formulate your own review of the book as you read, considering the following critical questions:  What contribution does this book make to the field or genre?Is the writing style clear and effective?Are concepts clearly developed?, If you're having trouble concentrating on a book, offer yourself rewards for finishing chapters, or the entire book. To make this reward system effective, ensure that rewards are realistic, immediate, and specific; your motivation will falter if you can't follow through with the reward, or if it is too vague or far in the future to inspire you.Smaller rewards (for finishing chapters or sections of a book) could include an indulgent snack, or watching an episode of a favorite television show.  Larger rewards (for getting through an entire book) could include an extravagant purchase, a gourmet supper, or a trip to the movies.  Consider switching how you approach the book in order to revive your interest in reading. If old school books are not your thing, try reading on a digital device. Alternatively, try reading out loud; it has been shown that doing so may help readers retain information better by creating a distinctive memory of what was said.Something as simple as switching from a paperback book to a hardcover book might also increase your enthusiasm about reading.  ","block out noise. distance yourself from your phone. find your zen place. reserve reading time. do some pre-reading exercise. have a healthy snack. get more sleep. read some reviews of the book. reward yourself for reading. switch up your reading style.

"Treats are what will make or break this training exercise. You'll need to find a treat that your chinchilla responds well to, which may take some trial and error. You can use store-bought treats specifically made for chinchillas, or you can use household foods that are safe for chinchillas like raisins.Limit how many treats you give your chinchilla each day. Some treats are okay, but too many can lead to weight gain, tooth decay, and other health problems.  Ask your vet if you're unsure how many treats your chinchilla should have. Your vet will most likely take your pet's size and weight into account.;  , Your chinchilla won't come running the way a dog would, but with a little patience, your pet chinchilla will come to you and climb onto you in response to a treat. However, your chinchilla will need to feel safe and comfortable around you before you can advance to this level of training, which may take time and patience.Hold the treat in one hand and lay your other open hand with your palm facing upwards.  Your open hand should act as a stepping stone for your chinchilla to climb onto you and get the treat.  Once your chinchilla learns to trust you and feels comfortable climbing into your hand for a treat, you may be able to coax your pet into your hand without food. You may even be able to perch your chinchilla on your shoulder and pet it, though this will take time and practice.  ","choose the right treats. present a treat. try it without treats. "

"This workout only uses one dumbbell. You can do this while standing or sitting.  Grasp one dumbbell with both of your hands and hold it behind your head. Your arms should be bent into right angles with your forearms running along the sides of your head so that the dumbbell is behind your head.  Extend your elbows and lift your forearms so that they are pointed vertically above your head with the dumbbell. Hold that position for a moment and then lower them back to the right angle position behind your head.  Stand with your back straight, and hinge forward from the hip. Start with arms hanging down, with your elbows to your ribs. This is the start position. Lift from the forearm only, so that the arm straightens parallel with the torso. The palm should turn up as it approaches the hip. As the elbow bends, lower the forearm. Repeat for the desired number of sets and repetitions.  Lie down on your back either on the ground or on your bed. If you have a workout bench at home, lie down on that.  Hold a dumbbell in each hand so that your palms are facing up. The outside of your forearms and elbows should be facing up towards the ceiling so that your arms create two upside-down ‘V’s. This is the resting position.

"One of the most important things you can do during the winter is keep enough gas in your car. If your car happens to break down, you will need to keep it running to stay warm. Doing this requires gas, so make sure you have a full tank for emergencies.When you idle your car to stay warm, the gas will last a long time.  Keeping your tank full also helps you not to run out of gas if you get too low.  Rear-wheel-drive cars may slide more than other cars on snowy or slick roads. Placing a couple of bags of sand in your trunk can help stabilize your car.Place the bags in your trunk behind the rear axle. The bags should be around the middle of your trunk.  Avoid placing too much weight in the back of your car since that can lift up the front of your car. Try starting with around 20 pounds.  You should stock a few helpful basic supplies in your car during the winter. Keep a snowbrush and ice scraper in your car to deal with windows. You should also place some extra washer fluid in case you run out while you are driving.You may also want to keep a shovel and bag of sand in the trunk to help in case you get stuck or can’t get traction.  In case you break down, you have an emergency kit full of items to help you stay warm. Gather blankets, gloves, hats, food, water, and any medication you may need in your vehicle.

"Staying at a hotel on the east end of the island, you are away from the crowds of Charlotte Amalie and have close access to the ferry out of Red Hook to Cruz Bay, St John. Pay the extra fee to have a beach front room, you'll be glad you did. Nothing beats walking out your front door and having your toes in the sand.;  , The cove at Secret Harbour is protected from the open ocean waves and is usually very calm and visibility is excellent. A wide range of fauna and flora can be found here. Stingrays, turtles, lobster (at night), crabs, eels, schools of beautiful Tangs, Cow fish, incredible corals and too much more to list here.  You didn't come here to watch cable TV all day. A trip into the main town of Charlotte Amalie is a must, especially if you're a shopper. Low cost liquor, cigarettes and jewelry can be found on nearly every corner here. Watch out for crowds from cruise ships during peak months though. A short climb up the hillside in town will take you to Blue Beards Castle. Spend a few bucks and take the tour. You get to see some very interesting colonial homes and their original furnishings. Also the lookout tower has one of the best views of the town and harbor you will find. Snoop around the rest of the town and you will find many fun things to see and do. Just remember to be cautious here at night and stay off the back alleys.  It is a tourist trap where you have to pay to get in and it has the feeling of a city park in the middle of a town. The scenery and snorkeling are better at just about any free beach on the island. If you want to lay in the sun go to Sapphire Beach, it's close. If you want to snorkel go down to Secret Harbour.

"Often, you can get away with some loose fitting clothing for several months before having to switch over to maternity wear.  Pants with an adjustable waist will come in handy for awhile before they are no longer suitable for your belly. Pair those skinny leggings with a long shirt.  These types of clothing offer enough room to accommodate your growing belly for several months. You can even wear your more stretchy dresses as tops as your belly expands.  Purchase a belly band to hold up your jeans so that you can leave them unzipped. By wearing a long shirt to cover the band, no one will even notice that you are wearing a belly band.  Roll up the sleeves and wear them over a pair of leggings.  Perhaps a too-short dress can become a long shirt or a pair of stretchy pants can be turned into shorts.  You can hunt for clothing that you may use from the items that they no longer want.

"The after-tax yield or after-tax return is the profitability of an investment after all applicable taxes have been paid. The type of tax paid and the investor’s marginal tax rate affect the amount of the after tax yield.The after tax yield may vary depending on whether the investor has to pay income tax or capital gains tax.The investor’s marginal federal and state tax rates. For investors whose income places them in a high tax bracket, the after tax yield may be significantly less than the pre-tax yield.;  , Your financial advisor calculates the after tax yield on your investments. Knowing the after-tax yield of your investments enables you to effectively compare them to tax-free investments, such as mutual bonds.Also, your financial advisor can use the information to increase the tax efficiency of your investments over the long term., Investors can reduce their taxes by purchasing municipal bonds, the interest on which is sheltered from federal and some state and local taxes. However the yield on municipal bonds is typically lower than that of taxable investments. In order to compare the profitability of taxable and tax-free investments, it is very helpful to calculate the after tax yield on the taxable investments., Depending on your tax bracket and how close you are to retirement, you can increase your after tax yield in the long-term with certain investment strategies. Different kinds of investments are taxed differently. Also, the same investment can be taxed differently depending on whether it is in a taxable brokerage account or a tax-deferred account such as an IRA, a 401k, a 403b or a Roth account.Your financial advisor can assess the after tax yield of different kinds of investments in different scenarios and counsel you on how to minimize the tax impact on these investments.  Don’t calculate the taxes based on the earnings of an investment during the calendar year. Instead, the taxes should be calculated taxable yield of the security.For example, suppose an investor owns a corporate bond. The bond's taxable yield is 6%.  , Different kinds of distributions receive different tax treatments.  For some distributions, the marginal tax rate is applied.  For others, other rates apply.The investor’s top marginal tax rate is used for short-term capital gains, taxable interest and non-qualified dividends.Long-term capital gains and qualified dividends are usually taxed at a lower rate than regular income tax rates.  Long-term capital gains are realized from investments that have been held for more than one year. Taxpayers in the 10 percent and 15 percent tax brackets pay 0 percent. Taxpayers in the 25 percent, 28 percent, 33 percent, and 35 percent tax brackets pay 15 percent.  Taxpayers in the 39.6 percent  tax bracket pay 20 percent.Qualified dividends are taxed at the same rate as long-term capital gains.,  The terms “tax bracket” and “marginal tax rate” are used synonymously. They both refer to the percentage of someone’s income that is paid in taxes. The higher a person’s income, the more they pay in taxes.Marginal tax rates range from as low as 10 percent to as high as 39.6 percent.  The income limits for each tax bracket differ for single filers, married joint filers and head of household filers.,  As of 2013, investors whose modified adjusted gross income is above a certain threshold are required to pay a 3.8 percent Medicare tax on interest, dividends and capital gain distributions.For 2015, the threshold was $250,000 for married filing joint status., After-tax yield can be calculated by simply multiplying the pre-tax yield by a multiple that incorporates the marginal tax rate on the bond. This formula is ATY=PTY∗(1−MTR){\displaystyle ATY=PTY*(1-MTR)} where ATY is the after-tax rate, PTY is the pre-tax rate, and MTR is the marginal tax rate., For short-term capital gains, taxable interest and non-qualified dividends, apply the top marginal tax rate. For long-term capital gains and qualified dividends, apply the appropriate tax rate.  For example, suppose investors who are married and filing jointly have a total taxable income of $100,000.  Their highest marginal tax rate, according to the IRS, is 25 percent.Also, the interest on their investments is subject to the 3.8 percent Medicare tax.The total tax rate to be applied to their short-term capital gains and taxable interest is 38.8 percent (25 + 3.8 = 28.8).  For long term capital gains and qualified dividends, their tax rate would be 15 percent., Input your variables into the equation and solve. Make sure that you've used the correct marginal tax rate for appropriate year. The result is your after-tax yield.  Remember to convert your percentages to decimals when calculating the after tax yield. Convert by dividing by 100. For example, 6% would be 6/100, or 0.06.  For example, with the 6% corporate bond and the 28.8 percent marginal tax rate, your after-tax yield would be calculated using the following equation: ATY=0.06∗(1−0.288){\displaystyle ATY=0.06*(1-0.288)}  This calculations gives an after-tax yield of 0.0427, or 4.27%.  ","learn the definition. understand why it is important. compare your taxable investments to tax-free investments. increase your after tax yield over the long term. identify the taxable yield. categorize the character of the distribution. find the investor’s marginal tax rate. determine if the net investment income tax should be applied. know the formula. determine the correct tax rate for the calendar year distribution. do the calculation.

"If your child doesn’t immediately listen, it may be tempting to lecture them about what they should be doing and why it’s important. However, your child will simply tune out long lectures. If your child doesn’t listen the first time, give them a short, firm reminder of what you expect.For example, if you asked your child to put something away and they have not, simply remind them “Toys still need to be put in the toy box.”  , Forcing consequences on your child likely only makes them more resilient to what you ask. Instead, allow them to choose the outcome for themselves by presenting them with the choice between positive and negative consequences.If your child refuses to get ready for school, give them an option such as, “You can get get ready for school and enjoy your video games when you get home, or you can stay at home with no games or TV all day.”  Create incentives for your child to make the proper choice, and allow them to choose whether they want to comply or accept the consequences.  When you give your child a command, you give them something to resist. Change your request from a command to a fact and let your child know what action should be taken to accommodate that fact.If it is your child’s chore to feed the cat, for example, don’t tell them “Go feed the cat now.” Instead, let them know, “The cat needs to be fed. It looks hungry.”  , If your child is resisting certain activities such as cleaning their room or doing their homework, you can try to create a game to motivate them. For example, you might create a beat-the-timer game to get your child to pick up their room.Reward your child for their participation in the game. This may be anything from a special treat to simply clapping and cheering on your child when they finish.  Help motivate your child to listen by providing them with rewards or incentives for completing certain tasks. Think about those issues your child does not want to budge on, and create a rewards program to get them to participate.  If, for example, your child lags while putting their shoes on in the morning, you can provide an incentive such as letting them pick the music in the car that morning if their shoes are on before you have to ask.  Rewards can be anything that you think your child would enjoy, from a small treat to a special privilege. You can even work out a program where if your child does certain things a certain number of times, they get a special trip like to the zoo or the beach.  Providing positive reinforcement is important for all kinds of kids, but it may be especially helpful for a stubborn child. Give your child affection such as with a hug, high five, or kiss on the cheek when they do a good job. Even smiling, winking, or nodding in your child’s direction can send some positive reinforcement their way. You can also try saying something like:  “Great Job!! I like the way you threw the ball”  “I see that you finished your homework. You are doing very good at staying on top of your schoolwork.”  “You showed a lot of responsibility when you helped your sister clean up her toys.”  “I see what a hard worker you've been, and I appreciate the way you always help me clear off the table after dinner.”  ","keep things short. give your child options. present them with facts. create games. create incentives. provide positive reinforcement.

"A marketplace website is any website where potential buyers can search through a wide range of items from many different sellers. Many marketplace websites sell a broad range of content, but those that specialize in homemade items or homemade jewelry may make it easier for you to draw the right client base to your online shop.;  , Marketplace websites make most of their money by charging fees. Many online market places charge listing fees, which are fees you pay to post an item to the website, and renewal fees, or fees paid to renew a listing if it expires before being sold. Some websites also take a percentage of the money you make from each item you sell. Every marketplace website is different, though, so you must research the fees for each one before signing up.  The majority of marketplace websites will accept the most common methods of payment, but this is not a guarantee. If you have a preferred method of payment, you should first find out which marketplace websites allow that method to be used.  A marketplace website that provides a phone number as well as an email address is more likely to be able to help you if any problems arise. Better customer support will lead to a more pleasant selling experience.  There are still fees involved with having your own website, but if you can generate a lot of sales, the fees will be much smaller than they would be if you continued selling through an online marketplace.  Allow your customers to pay you through a certified, third-party payment service. New customers are more likely to feel safer using a third-party payment group than they would be giving you their credit card information directly.  Go the extra mile to make your website look professional. Use webpage software or hire a web designer.  Note that you should only switch to your own website once you are able to invest a good deal of time into building your business. Otherwise, the cost of maintaining a website may not be worth it for the amount of sales you generate.

"This popular dessert is even more delicious when used as a filling for a light, sweet crepe. To make it, all you need is a banana, brown sugar, butter, and brandy. Melt a pat of butter in a saucepan, and then add a sliced banana. Sprinkle it with a few spoonfuls of brown sugar and let it caramelize. When the bananas are brown and crispy, spoon them onto a crepe, pour warmed brandy over it, and use a match to light it on fire to complete the caramelization.  This dish is delicious served with chilled whipped cream to offset the heat of the filling.  Add cinnamon and nutmeg to give the dish a warm, spicy flavor.  Chocolaty hazelnut spread is one of the most popular crepe fillings in France and other countries. The spread complements the light flavor of the crepes.  Sprinkle the hazelnut spread with chopped toasted nuts if you would like to add some crunch.

"One of the main problems with binge eating is mindlessly eating when you are not hungry. This can lead you to overeat because you are already eating when you aren't hungry. Instead of eating whenever the feeling strikes, when you are stressed, or for any other reason, only eat when you are hungry.You can prevent this by only eating when you notice you are hungry. Take an assessment of how your body feels and see if you are hungry.  You should also eat a meal or snack as soon as you realize you are hungry. If you wait until you are starving, you may be tempted to binge eat as much as possible., You may start mindlessly eating because you are bored.If you aren't hungry but have the compulsion to binge eat, ask yourself if you're eating just because you're bored. Are you peering into the fridge just because you're looking for something to do? If so, avoid eating.  Instead, drink a glass of water or find a way to stay active. Take a walk, call your best friend, or pick up a new hobby instead of eating., One way to lessen the chance of binge eating is to maintain portion control. Don't ever eat anything right out of a bag or box because you won't know how much you're eating. Measure out your meals and snacks, putting them in bowls or on plates. This will keep your eating habits within a normal range instead of pushing you to overeat or binge.Instead of deprivation, focus on moderation.If you're having a craving for peanut butter, have a spoonful of peanut butter with a banana. This will keep you from reaching your breaking point five days later and eating an entire jar of peanut butter.  If you go for half a day without eating, you will be much more likely to indulge in a binge. This may look like three meals or five to six smaller meals — consider talking to a nutritionist to figure out the best meal plan for your lifestyle. Find a way to eat healthy foods that you do love so your meals are nourishing and delicious.  This will help your not feel like you're just making your way through a boring tasteless meal instead of eating what you really want.Keep healthy snacks around the house to eat in between meals. You should eat three distinct meals, but keep around healthy options like fruits, nuts, and veggies to snack on in between meals.  If you pay attention to everything you eat, you will be less likely to get lost and not know what you are eating. Take time to consider what your food looks like, feel the food in your mouth, smell what it smells like, and taste what it tastes like. This will help you be aware of what you're eating.Each meal should have a distinct start and stop. Don't graze for twenty minutes while you're cooking your dinner, or snack while you're cleaning up after a meal.  Make sure you eat your meals at the kitchen table or another place designated for eating. Don't eat in front of the TV or your computer, or even when you're on the phone, or you won't be focused on what you're eating and will be less likely to enjoy what you're eating or to truly feel full.  Those who while distracted — watching TV or while working — tend to eat more than those who focus on their meal.You should also not eat standing up, since this will make the act feel disconnected from the eating process.  Eat your meals and snacks on smaller plates with smaller forks or spoons. The smaller plates and bowls will make you feel like you're eating more food, and the smaller forks or spoons will make you take more time to digest your food.  This will help you avoid overfilling your plate, which may make you more likely to eat more.  Another way to avoid binging is to keep yourself away from situations or foods that could lead to a binge.Taking measures to prevent binges in and out of your home will have a big impact on how you address your cravings. Avoiding triggers means recognizing a high-risk situation and creating a game plan to deal with it.  Try to spend more of your social time doing activities that don't involve food. Take a friend for a hike or a walk, or meet your friends at a bar that you know doesn't serve food.  If you're going to a family party or a potluck that you know will be filled with delicious foods and desserts, set out food limits for yourself. Tell yourself you can only have one plate of food and stick to it.  Bring your own snacks to places with tempting snacks. If you know you'll be tempted to binge eat popcorn at your local theater, sneak in your own portion controlled snacks, such as trail mix or microwave popcorn.  Many individuals with eating disorders consider getting help from a dietician. She can help you make a meal plan, decide what you need to eat every day, what portions you should eat, and how to change your relationship to the food. Your dietician can help you come up with sample menus, food lists, and portions to each per meal.This will help prevent you from binge eating because your food will be preset for each meal.  Your dietician can also help you get back to listening to your body's natural cues on when to eat and when to stop eating, which is important for BED.Be aware that the term 'nutritionist' is vague and could refer to someone with a PhD, or someone who has just done a quick course on nutrition — that is, she may not be qualified to give you sound nutritional advice. A registered dietician is considered a health professional with the requisite education and certifications, and is legally allowed to 'prescribe' a meal plan or treatment.  ","eat only when you're really hungry. avoid bored eating. manage your portions. schedule meal times.eating on a regular schedule at normal mealtimes will help your prevent binges. be a mindful eater.binge eating is often done quickly with little to no attention paid to what you are eating. eat in the right places. use the right dishware. avoid trigger foods or situations. consult a registered dietician.

"Try to make it as creative as possible; if you're given the opportunity to choose your own, take advantage of this. Choose something you're particularly interested in because this will make it easier to write; in particular, try to select the topic as a result of pressing questions you already know you want to search for answers to. Once you've decided on a topic, be sure to hone down it to a do-able topic; often a topic is initially too broad in its coverage, which will make it impossible to complete within the time and space constraints given. Narrow down your topic to something that can really be worked within the boundaries of the paper. If the topic is already chosen for you, start exploring unique angles that can set your content and information apart from the more obvious approaches many others will probably take. Finally, whatever angle your topic takes, it should be both original in approach and insightful, something the reader will be drawn into and fascinated by.  Take great care not to choose a topic and be so set on how you see the outcome of your paper that you're closed to new ideas and avenues of thinking as you work through the paper. This is known in academia as 'premature cognitive commitment'. It can mar an otherwise good paper because an outcome that is pre-determined in your head, regardless of the research findings along the way, will be molded to fit the outcome, rather than the outcome reflecting a genuine analysis of the discoveries made. Instead, ask continuous questions about the topic at each stage of your research and writing and see the topic in terms of a 'hypothesis' rather than as a conclusion. In this way, you'll be prepared to be challenged and to even have your opinion changed as you work through the paper.  Reading other people's comments, opinions and entries on a topic can often help you to refine your own, especially where they comment that 'further research' is required or where they posit challenging questions but leave them unanswered.  For some more help, see How to establish a research topic.  It's pointless to launch into writing before you've done the research. You need to understand the background to the topic and the current thinking, as well as finding out what future research is considered necessary in the area. While it may be tempting to rehash information you already know really well, avoid doing this or you learn nothing from the research and writing process. Go into research with a sense of adventure and an openness to learning things you've yet to grasp, as well as being ready to discover new ways of looking at old problems. When researching, use both primary (original text, document, legal case, interviews, experiment, etc.) and secondary (other people's interpretations and explanations of the primary source) sources. There is also a place for discussing with like-minded students and even finding online discussions about the topic if you feel comfortable doing this but these discussions are for idea-sharing and helping you to gel your ideas and are not usually quotable sources. For more information, here are some helpful resources to check out:  How to research a paper.  How to take notes, How to take better notes, How to take notes from a textbook, How to take notes on a book and How to take Cornell notes.  After you've done the research, reflect back over the chosen topic. At this point, it's essential to pinpoint the single, strong idea you'll be discussing, your assertion that you believe you can defend throughout the paper and that makes it clear to a reader what they're about to learn about and be given a sound conclusion on. Your thesis statement is the spine of your essay, the idea that you'll go on to defend in the paragraphs that follow. Serve it up half-baked and the remainder of the paper is bound to be flavorless. Construct a thesis that your research has proven is interesting to you – that way, backing it up won't be such a bore. Once you're satisfied that your topic is sound and clarified, proceed to writing your first draft.  Remember that the research doesn't stop here. And nor does the thesis statement, necessarily. Allow room for flexibility as you continue working through both the research and the writing, as you may wish to make changes that align with the ideas forming in your mind and the discoveries you continue to unearth. On the other hand, do be careful not to be a continuous seeker who never alights upon a single idea for fear of confinement. At some point you are going to have to say: 'Enough is enough to make my point here!' If you're so taken with a topic, there is always the possibility of postgraduate study some day but remember that the term paper has a finite word length and due date!  , Some people can work on a term paper skipping this step; they're a rare and often time-pressed breed. It is far better to have an outline sketched out so that you know where you're headed, just as a road map helps you to know where you're going from A to B. Like the entire paper, the outline is not set in stone but subject to changes. However, it does give you a sense of structure and a framework to fall back on when you lose your way mid paper and it also serves as the skeleton of your paper, and the rest is just filling in the details. There are different approaches to developing an outline and you may even have your own personal, preferred method. As a general guidance, some of the basic elements of an outline should include:  Introduction, discussion paragraphs/sections and conclusion or summary.  Descriptive or explanatory paragraphs following the introduction, setting the background or theme.  Analysis and argument paragraphs/sections. Using your research, write out the main idea for each body paragraph.  Any outstanding questions or points you're not yet sure about.  See How to write an outline for more details.  The introductory paragraph is challenging but avoid turning it into a hurdle. Of all the paper, this is the part often most likely to be rewritten as you continue working through the paper and experience changes of direction, flow and outcome. As such, see it as simply a means of getting started and remind yourself that it's always revisable. This approach allows you the freedom to mess it up but rectify it as needed. Also use this as an opportunity to help yourself come to grips with the general organization of the term paper by explaining the breakdown, something the reader will also need to be aware of from the start. Try using HIT as the means for getting your introduction underway:  Hook the reader using a question or a quote. Or perhaps relate a curious anecdote that will eventually make absolute sense to the reader in the context of the thesis.  Introduce your topic. Be succinct, clear and straightforward.  Thesis statement. This should have been clarified already in the previous step.  Don't forget to define the words contained in the question! Words like 'globalization' have many differing meanings and it's important to state which ones you'll be using as part of your introductory section.  Make sure each paragraph supports your argument in a new way. Not sure your body's up to task? Try isolating the first sentence of each paragraph; together, they should read like a list of evidence that proves your thesis.  Try to relate the actual subject of the essay (say, Plato's Symposium) to a tangentially related issue you happen to know something about (say, the growing trend of free-wheeling hookups in frat parties). Slowly bring the paragraph around to your actual subject, and make a few generalizations about why this aspect of the book/subject is so fascinating and worthy of study (such as, how different the expectations for physical intimacy were then compared with now).  Try using the ROCC method:  Restate your thesis statement.  One important detail which is usually found in your last paragraph.  Conclude – wrap it up.  Clincher – where you give the reader something left to think about.  Using outside sources? Find out which citation style your instructor prefers, MLA or APA (or other style if you're not in the USA). Each has a precise notation system, so if you're unsure of the rules, check the manual (online versions are available at owl.English.Purdue.EU). Peppering quotes throughout your text is certainly a good way to help make your point, but don't overdo it and take care not to use so many quotes as the embodiment of your points that you're basically allowing other authors to make the point and write the paper for you.  Avoid cutting and pasting from other people's arguments. By all means use eminent thinkers in the field's thoughts to back up your own thinking but avoid saying nothing other than 'A says... B says...'. The reader wants to know what you say ultimately.  It's helpful to sort out your bibliography from the beginning, to avoid having a last minute scramble: How to write a bibliography, How to write an APA style bibliography and How to write a bibliography in MLA format.  Space is at a premium in any graded paper, so finding ways to cull words is always a sensible approach. Are your sentences in good shape? Examine each one and decide whether you've used the fewest words possible while still retaining meaning.  Trade in weak 'to-be' verbs for stronger 'action' verbs. For example: 'I was writing my term paper' becomes 'I wrote my term paper.'  , Running your spelling-checker is only the first step in proofreading your paper! A spell-check won't catch errors like 'how' instead of 'show', nor will it pick up on doubled words ('the the') or grammar problems (unless you use MS Word, which can be configured to check grammar, and already catches double words). Little goofs like these aren't likely to impress the instructor – if you're too careless to proofread, after all, there's a good chance you didn't put much effort into your paper. Address the mess: ask a friend to read through your essay, marking any mistakes.  Decent grammar should be a given. You need a teacher to give you the benefit of the doubt, not correct your apostrophe use. A few too many errors and the message is soon lost beneath the irritation of the errors involved.  For some essayists, a great title appears at the beginning of writing while for others, it only becomes apparent after slogging through the paper in its entirety. If you're still stuck, brainstorm with a friend or family member; you might be surprised how a fresh mind unacquainted with the topic can come up with a pithy title at a moment's notice!  ","choose your topic. do your research. refine your thesis statement. develop an outline for the paper. make your point in the introduction. convince the reader with your body paragraphs. conclude with strength. show some style. burn flab, build muscle. don't be a such a slob. think of a good title to catch the reader's attention, but not a too long or too short one!

"To do so, simply move the mouse around and look for a response from the cursor on your Mac's screen.  If your mouse isn't connected, it may not be on.

"Depending on your reasons for trying to deepen your voice, you might decide that it's worth pursuing options that cost money. Voice training and surgery are two of these options, both with large potential for success. If you want a lower voice to improve your confidence or social or dating life, you may want to stick to the slower but safer and cheaper options.  One surgery shown to reduce the pitch of one's speaking voice permanently is called a thyroplasty and it involves reducing the tension in the vocal chords.Another involves injecting a subjects own fat into their vocal folds, which can reportedly lower pitches and improve voice quality. Though hormone replacement therapy alone usually lowers trans men's voices to more masculine levels, surgeries like these can be a next step for those that desire deeper voices., Vocologists specialize in helping their clients improve their speech in any number of ways, including altering their pitch. A good vocologist will help you identify the causes of your high-pitched voice and teach you change them. There are even vocologists who specialize in helping transgender people achieve more masculine or feminine voices.Your chances of lowering your pitch permanently are increased greatly if you get the help from a professional rather than just relying on self-guided practice.  ","decide whether more costly options are right for you. look into voice lowering surgery. get voice training from a speech expert. "
"Before you start looking for work, you need to make sure you are eligible to work. There are some federal and state regulations that say you must be a certain age to work, and others that restrict teens from certain types of jobs. Find out any rules in your state that would keep you from working. You may need to talk to your school to see if you need paperwork from them, as well.Individual companies may also have restrictions about age, so you want to pay attention to those requirements as you are searching and looking at applications. You don’t want to spend the time it takes to file an application if they only hire people who are 18 years or older.;  , One of the most important, and often hardest, aspects of getting a job is learning to ask for it. Talk to everyone you know and tell them you are job searching. Ask them if they know of any good opportunities at the moment. It is great to ask adults like your parents, aunts and uncles, teachers, guidance counselors, and church leaders. These connections can be especially helpful in getting informal jobs like babysitting and lawn care.There is also always the possibility that you know people who work in places that would hire teenagers for assistant type work, filing, or cleaning positions.  Once you have made the initial ask, and especially if the person tells you they will check into something, make sure to follow up with them later on to see if they found out anything.  A great option for teens is to go the more entrepreneurial route, rather than seeking jobs within a company structure. Going the self-employment route gives you greater flexibility in regards to how often and how many hours you work. When you are using your connections, pointing out your interest in self-employment is always a good plan.The types of jobs you have available in this area include babysitting (which people always need), lawn care (such as mowing, gardening, or even simple landscaping), dog walking, or car washing. You could even offer pickup and delivery services (if you can legally drive) for things like groceries, dry cleaning, or other goods.  People have all kinds of things that they need done, and as a teen, you may be able to offer them lower prices than if they hired an adult. Don’t limit your thinking about what opportunities might be available.  Volunteering for a while can be a great way to start building relevant work skills that make you more marketable. If you have the time to put into volunteering somewhere on a consistent and long-term basis, you may be able to build enough rapport with them that you can move into a paid position.If the business or organization you are volunteering with starts looking to hire, you will be a better candidate than many others because you already know their environment and goals well.  In today’s marketplace, online and telecommute jobs are plentiful, and many are viable options for teens. If you have a skill for writing, there are many online platforms that allow you do freelance work. As long as you can perform the writing well, your age would not restrict you. If you have any website design or other graphic design experience, this can be another good option.In many cases, you will still need to meet specific qualification standards. Some freelance jobs will require you to have a degree, some experience, or be of adult age. When looking at potential opportunities, be careful to look for these requirements.  Consider learning to buy and sell things online, such as comics, antiques, or other merchandise. You may need your parents to help set up an account for something like eBay if there is a restriction, but then you would be able to do the work of selling.  Online working options could be great when you are still in school, because they rarely require you to work specific scheduled hours. You would have the freedom to work around your schedule, and do extra work anytime you have days off from school.  Although jobs may be limited by your age, many great opportunities still exist. Many restaurants, retail stores, or agricultural and labor jobs allow younger employees. Don't say no to these types of jobs, even if they would not be your favorite choice. At 16, this probably won't be your lifelong job, so be willing to do something that you may not love for a while to earn a little money and gain work experience.  ","pay attention to age regulations. use your connections. make a job for yourself. don't be afraid to volunteer. pursue online opportunities. be open to what is available. "
"Mostly on the dry area's, such as your knuckles, your fingertips and in between your thumb and index finger.;  , Gloves are great accessories when Winter arrives. After you've applied lotion, whether you are going out to work or to school; always wear gloves. Leather gloves are more reliable than cotton or polyester gloves, though anything covering your hands during the cold season will work.  A small bottle of lotion is always handy when you're at work or at school and feeling the irritation and burning sensation of your cracked skin. The unscented kind are probably better off than the floral, fruity (they leave a bit of a distraction) ones when you're out in public. May i recommend Aveeno?  , Make sure you're especially applying the lotion over your hands and knuckles until they feel somewhat smooth. (The process isn't quick.)  , (Ignore this step if your hands aren't severely dry) Nighttime. Right before bed (and after you've applied lotion) apply some Vaseline or any brand of Petroleum jelly all over the dry areas of your hands. Those cotton gloves come in handy during this step! Carefully slip on the cotton gloves (the ones at the dollar store/any cheap ones are fine) and make sure the jelly is secure inside the gloves. Now, it may feel uncomfortable but it works. Sleep with the gloves on throughout the entire night. This is the only way your skin will have the time to heal without any distraction and keep soft during the entire night.  ","once you're awake in the morning, apply a generous amount of vaseline or any type of moisturizing hand cream or lotion. wear gloves. bring lotion with you!, before bed, take some of the same body lotion (unscented, scented - doesn't matter) and apply it over the dry areas of your hands, elbows, wrists, feet. apply petroleum jelly at night. repeat, and good luck.

"The majority of Pokémon evolve when they reach a certain level. A Pokémon 'levels up' (gains a level) by gaining experience points from fights. The level that triggers an evolution varies from Pokémon to Pokémon.  If you're unsure when or how a Pokémon will evolve, this information is easy to find online. You can check the Pokémon's page on a Pokémon resource site like Bulbapedia, for instance.Note that select Pokémon will only evolve by using special items or by meeting special conditions. For example, Eevee requires an evolutionary stone to evolve no matter how many levels it gains.;  , When you get your Pokémon to a high enough level (or use an evolution stone, etc.), you will see an evolution dialogue screen with 'What? (name of Pokémon) is evolving!' or a similar message. Wait for the evolution 'animation' to appear. The screen may flash and the Pokémon may 'blink' between its current form and its next evolution.  More modern Pokémon games generally have fancier evolution screens than older games, but the general idea is the same for all games in the series.  As soon as you see the animation begin, press the B button rapidly. Don't wait too long or the evolution will finish.  Eventually, you will see 'Huh? (name of Pokémon) stopped evolving!' or a similar message. At this point, the evolution is canceled. If your Pokémon gained a level, it will keep its level but will stay in the same form.  Cancelling an evolution once will not cancel it in the future. If your Pokémon starts to evolve again, you will need to repeat the process above to cancel it. If you don't, it will evolve.  For Pokémon that evolve normally from leveling up, you'll need to cancel every time the Pokémon gains a level.  ","wait until your pokémon starts to evolve. watch for the evolution animation. press b repeatedly. repeat as needed. "
"There are many different credit card companies offering cash-back rewards cards. The best way to start when researching these offers is by searching online. There you'll get a comprehensive listing of every company offering cash-back credit cards, and you'll be able to read the specific terms and conditions of each card.  Search online for 'cash back credit card' or 'best cash back credit card offers' to see a comprehensive listing.;  , Before you sign up for a cash-back credit card (or any credit card, for that matter), you should look into the terms and conditions of that card. Many cards have offers that expire after several months to a year, while even otherwise good rewards cards have limits to what you can get cash back on.Some cards offering higher cash-back rates often have restrictions on where they can be used. For example, a card that offers 3% may only give that rate for groceries; all other purchases may be just 1% cash back.  There may be limits to how much you can reclaim on a cash-back rewards card. Once you pass that limit, your rewards percentage may lower considerably.Cards with specific business or category affiliations often get a higher percentage back from each purchase than a general cash-back card.Certain cards rotate out which category or categories they offer the highest rewards for, which may make it difficult to consistently get the best rewards.  Stiff penalties and high fees can quickly outweigh the benefits you receive from a cash-back credit card. Before you commit to a given credit card, look at how much you'll have to pay in annual and monthly fees, as well as any potential penalties that are imposed for late payments or periods of inactivity.Some cards make you forfeit accumulated rewards and rebates if you miss consecutive payments or have a prolonged period of card inactivity.  Depending on the credit card company you're considering, you may have to agree to an inflated annual fee to get the most out of your cash-back card.  For example, one American Express card only charges annual fees for the 'Preferred version,' which doubles your rebate on certain items but charges a $75 annual fee. Depending on how often you make purchases and use rewards, this may or may not be worth it.  The APR is the rate of interest charged each year on purchases you make with your card. Most cards have a fixed APR for the year, though you may be able to avoid paying that interest for many credit cards.Some credit card companies assign an APR to your card based on your credit score. There may be multiple tiers of percentage rates, depending on how well you score.  Many credit card companies do not impose interest on your purchases if you are consistently diligent in paying off your monthly balance, but not all cards. Ask about the APR for any card you're considering.  Getting cash back for your purchases may sound like free and easy money. However, there can be significant out-of-pocket costs associated with your card, depending on what you qualify for. If you have good credit, use your card frequently, and pay off your bills on time each month, the rewards may outweigh the costs. If not, though, you may end up paying considerable fees.Foreign transaction fees are assessed when you use your card while traveling in a foreign country. Some cards charge a foreign transaction fee, while others do not. Those that do charge a fee often vary, but it's best to find a fee below 3%. There are also a number of 'travel' credit cards that do not charge a foreign transaction fee.Many of the best rewards offers require excellent credit.Depending on your credit score, you may not be eligible for these deals, and you may have to settle for a less-rewarding card.  Any time you apply for a credit card, the credit card company you apply with runs a credit check on you. Having outstanding debts can significantly lower your credit score and may even flag you as a high risk.Make sure you are in good standing with all of your creditors before you begin the credit card application process. That way your credit check will come back with a higher rating, and you may even be eligible for a better interest rate or card option.  If a lender runs a comprehensive credit search, your credit may be affected in the future if that lender uncovers a bad credit history. When you pre-apply for a credit card, a 'soft' credit search is run. Only you see your credit search, which means that your future credit won't be affected. This can give you the opportunity to put off applying and pay off your debts so that you will be approved when you do apply in the future.If you're approved, you can go ahead and apply. If not, you'll need to fix your credit before applying again.  Once you've settled on a card and you've gotten your finances in order, you're ready to apply for your own cash-back credit card. The easiest way to apply is by going online and visiting that card company's website. From there you can fill out an online application form, and you'll typically find out if you're approved as soon as you submit your information.You'll need to enter some personal information, including your name, address, phone number, and social security number.  In order to check your credit, most card companies will also ask for your bank account information and details about your employment history and income.  If you're approved, your card will arrive in the mail shortly. If not, you should call the card company to find out why so that you can make any necessary arrangements.  The easiest way to rack up rewards is by using your card consistently. You can use your card for everyday purchases, but if your card offers higher rewards through certain vendors or types of stores you should make a point of making purchases there.You can typically use your credit card anyplace that you would otherwise pay with cash, debit cards, or personal checks.  Check to see if most vendors accept your card. Some credit cards, like American Express, are not as widely accepted as some of their competitors, such as Visa or MasterCard., Most credit cards charge a fee for withdrawing cash. However, it's particularly ill-advised for a cash-back credit card. The fees and potential interest charged for getting cash back may end up outweighing the cash-back rewards you accrue., Cash-back credit cards can be a great perk for smart shoppers. If you're not careful, though, you could end up forfeiting a lot of the rebates you rack up. Canceling your card can also have negative repercussions for your overall credit score. If you want to maintain your credit and keep your rewards, you'll need to keep your card active and use it regularly.If you don't use your card frequently enough, you may end up losing your rebates. However, overspending just to get a rebate could deplete your savings.  Try to find a balance by using the card regularly without overspending. If you need help, you can contact a credit counseling agency to help you manage your finances.  Canceling a credit card may cause your credit score to go down. It's best to keep your card active and use it regularly, even if it's just for small purchases.  Failing to pay off your bill for two or more consecutive months could cause you to lose your accrued rewards. Maintaining a debt for prolonged periods of time can also negatively affect your credit score. The best way to ensure that your bills get paid on time each month is to set up a direct debit payment through your bank.Most financial institutions that offer online banking give you the option of setting up automatic monthly payments for bills, utilities, or even rent payments.  Make sure your payment and billing information is up to date to ensure your monthly payments wipe out your bills.  ","compare credit card offers. read the fine print on cash-back rewards. look at any annual fees and penalties that are imposed. check the annual percentage rate (apr) imposed on purchases. recognize that it's not necessarily free money. sort out any outstanding debts. pre-apply to check your credit eligibility. apply for the card of your choice. use your card for all normal purchases and expenses. avoid withdrawing cash with your card. protect the benefits of your cash-back card. set up a direct debit to pay your monthly balance in full.

"The best way to become paler is also the most intuitive: limiting your time in the sun to protect your skin and avoid tanning. Instead of all together avoiding going outside on sunny days, instead try to spend your time in the shade, or else wear protective clothing like sunglasses and a sunhat if you are going to be in direct sunlight.Don’t completely avoid the sun. Sunlight is a vital source of Vitamin D, which has numerous and invaluable health benefits. A good 10-20 minutes in the sun (wearing sunblock) is enough to get your daily dose of Vitamin D.  In addition to avoiding direct sunlight, wearing sunscreen is also an essential part of protecting your skin from the sun. Wear at least SPF 30, preferably a formula that contain zinc and titanium dioxide, which directly block both UVA and UVB rays and begin working as soon as you put them on your skin. Since sunscreen is white, it may also you’re your skin look paler, even when it is completely rubbed in.Wear sunblock every day on your face and any other parts of your body that will be exposed to the sun. Use water-resistant sunblock if you are going to be swimming.  While you are in direct sunlight, reapply sunblock every two hours.  To apply sunblock, use at least a quarter-sized amount on your face and any other exposed parts of your body. Rub the sunblock fully into your skin to ensure that it will work properly., Another important way to promote pale and luminous skin is to wash your face in the morning and before bed. Washing your face properly and consistently removes oil and dirt from the surface of your skin, making your complexion lighter and more radiant.Try to use a face wash with lemon or Aloe Vera extract, which both have deep cleansing properties.  Once a week, use an exfoliating face wash along with a textured cloth or a loofa. Gently scrub your skin in circular motions to remove excess dead and dry skin cells from the surface of your skin. Don’t exfoliate more than once a week, as it can be harsh on your skin to over-exfoliate.  Moisturize your face every time after washing it, making sure to use a sheer moisturizer rather than a tinted moisturizer.  Apply sunblock after using moisturizer, or use a moisturizing sunblock that is at least SPF 30.  Not only does smoking have a negative effect on your health, it can also dramatically alter the appearance of your skin. Smoking can cause premature aging of the skin, as well as breakouts and sallowness from a loss of natural “glow.” Consider quitting or cutting back your smoking if you are a regular smoker.  ","limit your time in the sun. wear sunscreen every day. wash and exfoliate your skin regularly. don’t smoke cigarettes. "
"If you’re good with animals, starting a petsitting service can be a good way to get into business. The costs to you are mostly limited to promoting the service by printing out fliers and business cards, and the pay can be decent--$10-$20 for a dog walk, double that for an overnight stay.When you’re advertising your business, start local, especially if you don’t have a car. Post your fliers in community clubhouses, and leave leaflets on people’s doors. Find out more about starting a petsitting business at Start a Pet Sitting Business.  If you’re a little older and you like children, babysitting can be a good way to make money. A teenage babysitter won’t get paid as much as an adult would, but they can still make $10 or more an hour, and even more if there are multiple children involved.If you plan on babysitting for more than six months, you should invest in taking a CPR/First Aid class. Not only will it help you respond to an emergency, you’ll get paid more if you do. You can find a CPR class near you at http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/CPRAndECC/CPR_UCM_001118_SubHomePage.jsp.  Again, it’s a good idea to start in your neighborhood. However, a lot of babysitters are older teenagers who have cars, and many parents are willing to provide transportation to the right sitter, so you can advertise more widely within your local area.  Find out about starting a babysitting business in detail at Start Your Own Babysitting Business  , Another way to make money is by providing lawn care in your neighborhood. People are often willing to let a neighborhood kid cut their grass, and it will give you a way to get a little extra spending money.The downside to this is that lawn care is hard work. It takes a lot of hours and requires a lot of equipment. On top of everything, people won’t pay a minor the same rate as an adult. Add on the fact that you’re most likely confined to your neighborhood (unless you have transportation), and you'll see it’s hard to make a steady income from it.  Another good neighborhood business to start is washing and detailing cars. You can usually charge at least as much to wash a car as you can to cut grass, it will take about the same amount of time, and you won’t need to buy as much equipment.The downside is, like lawn care, it can be physically demanding and take up a lot of your time.  If you have good grades, you may be able to get a job tutoring other students who need help with school. You can help kids learn how to read, teach algebra to middle school students, or help high school students practice for their SATs.  Tutoring does not mean that you do the homework for clients or give test answers to other students. Instead, your job is to help them understand the concepts so that they can do the work themselves. Make sure you understand the line between teaching others and cheating.  You can advertise your services to both students and parents.  While all business owners need to be reliable, those offering services need to be extra reliable. After all, few will notice if the kid selling candy on the subway misses a day of work, but everyone will notice if their babysitter doesn’t show up.  Keeping a calendar of your jobs and assignments is a good way of keeping on top of things so you can stay reliable. It also helps to tell your friends and family about upcoming jobs. That way, if it slips your mind, they might remember.  ","watch people’s pets. babysit people’s children. provide neighborhood lawn care. wash and detail people’s cars. tutor other students. be reliable. "

"You will never get table service in a pub for drinks. Well, let’s not say never. You will get table service in the occasional snooty London wine bar. Suffice to say that if you don’t look at the drinks menu and think, “Are these prices for bottles or glasses?” then you’re not getting table service. You’re also unlikely to find a drinks menu on your table––to find out which drinks they have, you generally need to go to the bar and look at the beer taps. They may also have some sort of board on the wall showing beer and wine. On the up side you will never be expected to tip for drinks. Once you’ve decided what you and your party want to drink, someone will have to go to the bar and buy the round.;  , Customers waiting at the bar are rarely served in the order in which they arrived. The most reliable method for being served promptly is to stand close to the bar (perhaps leaning gently on it, but not right over it) and smile as often as possible at a bartender of your choice. Things that will get you served faster than average are:  Being attractive, and of the opposite sex to the bar person  Being tall  Knowing the bar person  ,  ","know that there is no table service. know the art of getting served. things that will get you served slower than average are: shouting or whistling waving money leaning right over the bar being noticeably drunk (unless also attractive, in which case this may be a positive feature) being small being clearly a part of an enormous group and therefore about to try to buy seventeen drinks, a third of which you’ve forgotten already and another third of which you’re going to have to shout back to your friends to find out what they want sounding english (in scotland) sounding scottish (in england) sounding french (universal) "
"Everyone lies once in a while, but take a minute to consider whether lying is really worth it in this case. Lying takes a lot more mental capacity than telling the truth, and you might get in trouble if you get caught.  You might have a good reason for lying, such as trying to keep a friend in the dark about a surprise party. If this is the case, try not to feel bad about it because you're actually doing something nice!  Never tell a lie for no reason at all. Lying just for fun or just to see if you can get away with it is sure to get you into trouble eventually.  If you're telling a selfish lie or a lie that might hurt other people, consider taking the high road and telling the truth.;  , Your lie will be much more convincing if you take the time to think about what you will say and add in meaningful details. Your story should be detailed enough to come across as genuine, but not so detailed that it seems constructed.The amount of detail in your lie should be similar to the amount of detail you would offer if you were telling the truth. If you are known for chatting on forever about everything, it will probably seem suspicious if your lie is short and to the point. Conversely, if you are typically not very talkative, you might raise some red flags if your story is overly embellished.  Even if the basis of your lie is perfectly believable, adding in details that seem far-fetched might give you away, so keep it grounded. For example, telling your friend that you stood him up because your grandma wasn't feeling well and you had to take her to a doctor's appointment is more believable than telling him that you stood him up because your grandma was kidnapped and you had to rescue her. In both cases, the gist is that you had to help your grandma, but the details are very different.  You will have to remember all your details, so don't go overboard. Write them down if you have to.  The easiest way to lie is to simply bend the truth. This will allow you to tell a story that is mostly true, including lots of supporting details that are mostly true, with only a little bit of untruth mixed in.The less prepared you are, the fewer lies you should incorporate into your story. If you're completely caught off-guard in a situation and you need to lie, bend the truth as slightly as you can to avoid tripping yourself up.  People often get caught lying because they tell different stories to different people. If these people ever compare notes, your lie will be revealed, so make sure you come up with one story that you can tell to everyone.Keep in mind that your story might spread, so you need to be prepared to keep telling it in the same way you did the first time if someone else asks you about it.  Take into account what everyone who will hear the lie already knows about you and about the situation. Be careful about including details that anyone who is even remotely likely to hear the lie will know are false. For example, don't tell a friend that you lost the bracelet you borrowed from her while swimming in the lake if you have mutual friends who know that you can't swim.  The more detailed your lie is, the more time you will have to spend on making sure you think of every detail and remember the whole story. Try rehearsing it aloud to yourself several times to make sure you feel confident.  Make sure you remember important details like names and dates. If you get these wrong your whole lie might start to fall apart.  Keep in mind that you don't want to sound like you're reading from a script. While it's a good idea to plan out the details of your lie, avoid planning out every single word you want to say. Your lie will be much more convincing if your speech sounds natural and unrehearsed.  The content of your lie will generally dictate this. Think about how likely you would be to bring the topic up if it were true.  If your story is boring or uneventful, don't bring it up until you're asked. For example, if you plan on lying to your friend by telling her that you didn't call her back because you had spotty cell reception, you might not want to bring it up first.  If your story is exciting or upsetting, you should probably bring it up right away, or it might seem like you aren't as emotionally invested in the situation as you should be. If, for example, you plan to tell your friend that you didn't return her call because you had a huge fight with your mom and you were too upset to talk to anyone, tell her the next time you see her.  While research has shown that looking nervous does not necessarily indicate that you are lying, many people still believe that it does, so be safe and do your best to keep your calm.Look straight at the person you are speaking to and talk fluently.  Remember to keep a natural-looking smile on your face.  Stand still and don't shift around.  Depending on what your lie is, you might need some acting classes to nail the appropriate emotions. Everyone expresses emotions differently, but try not to be unusually more or less emotional about the situation than you would be if it were true.If you're concerned that you won't be able to express the right emotions while lying, consider changing the lie to something less challenging.  Avoid getting defensive if someone asks you to explain your story. Stick to the emotions that are appropriate for your lie.  Use vocabulary that is similar to what you would normally use, and keep the conversation flow as natural as possible.  Don't talk too fast or too slow.  If appropriate for the situation, use phrases that invite feedback so that you're not just reciting a monologue.  Gesture as you normally would. A lack of hand gestures can indicate that you are thinking about what you are saying.Be prepared to say, 'I didn't notice' or 'I don't remember' if someone asks you a question and you're not sure what else to say.Avoid conversation fillers like 'um' or long gaps in the conversation. This will make it look like you're actively trying to think of what to say, which is a dead giveaway that you're lying. If you need a second to remember a specific detail, move on to something else, but keep the flow of the story as natural as possible.  Try not to say the same thing over and over. You'll sound too rehearsed., Don't make it seem like you want to move on to the next topic as quickly as possible. Provide sufficient details before segueing into something else to keep the conversation going., If you have any evidence that can support your lie, even if it's very vague, it might help your case. Research has shown that people are more likely to believe statements that are accompanied by pictures, so if you can think of a way to make this work with your lie, go for it.Do this as naturally as possible. If you have a photo, for example, you can show it to your friend as a part of the conversation, but don't make it seem like you're showing it to her in order to prove that you're not lying.  Having other people back your lie up can also be helpful, as long as they know to stick to the details you've provided.  It's a good idea to know what you will say if you get caught lying, just in case. If you have a good enough explanation, you might be able to avoid getting into as much trouble.  ","think about why you need to lie. plan out the details of your story. start with the truth. think about who will hear the lie. rehearse your story. tell the lie at the right time. don't look nervous. act the part. recite your lie. change the subject at the right time. back your lie up. have a backup plan.

"Exotic plants offer some really great architectural elements to the garden. When planning your garden, think about using some tall, striking plants such as Gunnera, Dicksonia Antarctica (which grows up to 3m in height) or Cordyline, that add both height and texture to the garden.;  , A mix of colors and textures is often particularly successful in an exotic garden. For example, try mixing green spiky plants such as Agave together with softer textured silver or blue grasses, and the striking red flowers of Bromeliad or Hibiscus.  Add some mid-height plants such as Colocasia and Strelitzia (Bird of Paradise), as well as smaller lower-growing ones such as small Aloes. A few climbers such as Passionflower, Kiwi or Hedera will soften the look of the garden over time.  Exotic plants will be complemented by plants that aren’t strictly exotic, but look as if they could be. Examples include Japanese Painted Ferns or Sweet Potato Vine.  Remember to include evergreens for year-round interest, or your garden will look very bare over the winter months. Fatsia japonica or bamboo will provide year-round color and interest.  Exotic plants will generally do better in a sunny, sheltered spot with rich well-drained soil. However, no matter how sheltered or sunny your garden is, it’s important to keep in mind that many varieties of exotic plants will need protection over the winter months.  When you design your garden, it’s important to think about how you are going to overwinter your plants, or if you plan on overwintering them at all.  If you are growing Begonias, either treat them as annual plants (which live for one year only) or be prepared to bring them inside over the winter.  Plants such as Hibiscus or Bougainvillea will want to go into a greenhouse or conservatory for the coldest months of the year.  If you have limited space indoors, either be prepared to replace these plants every year or grow fewer of them.  Mature banana plants and some species of palm can survive the winter outdoors in a sheltered position if wrapped up with something like rush screening or special plant wrapping fleece.  Design your garden so you can easily access these plants to wrap them when required. This means you should avoid planting underfoot so you don’t have to tread on other plants to access the plants that need wrapping.  You’ll also need access to all sides of the plant in order to wrap it up, so don’t plant it tight into a corner.  Once wrapped, the plant won’t be very attractive. Putting fairy lights inside the wrap can help raise the temperature inside on cold nights and also make it look more attractive.  Young versions of palm and banana plants should be moved inside a greenhouse over the winter. If they are large and heavy, consider planting in large planters with trolley wheels attached. This makes it much easier to move them.  Some exotic plants such as Bougainvilla and Passionflower will survive a mild winter outside from zones 8B and up. Consider making these hardier exotics the backbone of your garden.  This will minimize the work you need to do in the fall to prepare the garden for winter and help to keep your garden from looking completely desolate over the winter months.  The term 'zones' refers the USDA plant hardiness scale, which divides the USA into 11 planting zones, according to their average annual minimum winter temperature. Find out which zone you live in by going to the National Gardening Association website and entering your zip code.  Plants such as Caladium or Canna that grow from tubers or bulbs will benefit from being lifted and overwintered indoors. The bulbs or tubers can then be replanted outdoors again in spring.  Make sure you can easily access these plants to dig them up at the right time, or plant them in containers so you can locate them quickly and move them inside before winter.  It’s important to remember that many tropical plants are poisonous and some, such as Caladium, can irritate the skin.  If you are concerned about children or animals eating or touching the plants, consider adding fencing to restrict their access, or choose plant varieties you know to be non-toxic.  Avoid planting spiky plants close to seating areas or walkways, as these may catch in your clothing and cause a tear.  Additionally, children may cut or prick their fingers by grabbing onto sharp or prickly leaves.  Plants that drop their leaves, flowers or fruit may be annoying if planted over decking or walkways as they can make the surface slippery and require regular cleaning up.  ","use a number of tall, striking plants. plan on having a mixture of colors and textures. add some mid-height and low growing plants. consider including some interesting indigenous plants. remember to include some evergreen plants to add interest year-round. choose a sunny, sheltered, well-draining spot for your exotic plants. think about how you intend to overwinter your plants. wrap mature banana plants and certain species of palm over the winter. move young banana plants and palm trees indoors over the winter. plant a selection of hardier exotic plants to keep your garden interesting over the winter. lift delicate tubers or bulbs and bring them indoors over the winter. take precautions when planting poisonous exotic plants. avoid planting prickly or spiky plants near benches or walkways. don’t put shedding plants over decking or walkways.

"Use a large bowl or your bathtub to soak your foot. This will help reduce swelling and tenderness. Soak it for about 15 minutes. Repeat 3-4 times per day.Add Epsom salts to the water. Epsom salts are widely recognized for their ability to reduce pain and swelling. These will also help soften the toenail. Add 1 cup of Epsom salts to a bathtub filled with a few inches of water or a foot bath.  If you don't have Epsom salts, you can use plain salt. Salt water will help reduce the growth of bacteria in the area.  Gently massage the affected area. This will help water soak into the ingrown toenail, which will help clear out bacteria and may relieve swelling and pain.  After you soak your foot, the toenail should be softened. Carefully work a piece of clean dental floss under the edge of your nail. Lift up the edge of the toenail gently so that it does not grow further into your skin.Try this approach after every foot soak. Use a clean length of floss each time.  Depending on the extent of your ingrown toenail, this might be a little painful. Try taking a pain reliever to ease your discomfort.  Don’t dig too much into your toenail. You can cause more infection, which may require medical intervention.  An over-the-counter pain reliever can give you some relief from the discomfort you’re experiencing. Try a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) such as ibuprofen, naproxen, or aspirin. NSAIDs can help relieve pain and inflammation.If you cannot take NSAIDs, try acetaminophen instead.  An antibiotic cream will help fight off infection. This type of cream is readily available at drug stores and grocery stores.Antibiotic creams also can have topical anesthetic such as lidocaine. This will temporarily relieve the pain in the area.  Follow application instructions on the cream’s package.  To protect your toe from getting further infected or caught on your sock, wrap a bandage or bit of gauze around your toe.  Give your feet some extra room by choosing to wear open-toe shoes, sandals or other loose-fitting shoes.Tightly fitting shoes can cause or exacerbate an ingrown toenail.  Homeopathy is alternative medicine that relies on herbs and other natural ingredients to treat various ailments.To treat ingrown toenail pain, try one or more of the following homeopathic remedies:  Silicea Terra, Teucrium, Nitric Acid, Graphites, Magnetis Polus Australis, Phosphoric Acid, Thuja, Causticum, Natrum Mur, Alumina, or Kali Carb.

"Dust your rugs and carpets evenly with baking soda. Use as much as you deem necessary, depending on the smell’s strength. For a quick job, allow the baking soda to absorb odors for at least a quarter of an hour (or longer if you have the time) before vacuuming. For a more thorough freshening, declare the area off-limits for the next 24 hours and then vacuum it the following day.  Dust the bottom of your garbage can and/or the inside of your trash liner to counteract stinky garbage.

"Believe in your ability to overcome your fear of ghosts and believe in your ability to face the unknown with strength and bravery. If you don’t trust your power to overcome this fear, you will never be successful.  Don’t beat yourself up over your fear. Realize that it is perfectly natural.  Recall your past successes. Think back about a time where you faced a difficult situation and came out on top.  Allow yourself time to overcome your fear and if you fail, always set your mind to try again.  Remember that you yourself are composed of a spirit as well—the only difference is that you are living in both the physical and the spiritual worlds, while ghosts live in only the spiritual world. Connecting to the spiritual world should not be considered something that is supernatural when spirit is who we are.Make an effort to embrace both the physical and spiritual world equally. Remember, ghosts or spirits are part of who you are and you’re not scary, right?  Make an effort to think of ghosts as non-scary and non-threatening spirits—just like you.  All life starts from the same place, so instead of viewing a ghost as a scary, other-worldly being, view them as a light that comes from the same place that you do.Know who your higher power is. Whether it is God, Christ, Santa Claus, or any other being, know that all energy and life stems from them.  Imagine that both you and the ghost stem from this higher power in the form of warm, glowing light.  Allow that light to protect you from anything that is dark. Invite only love and light into your life., What better way to get rid of fear than to laugh?

"It’s best to clear large garden shrubs at a time when birds aren't nesting, to avoid disturbing wildlife.  Aim to clear larger shrubs during the fall or winter to avoid this.  It’s usually easier to dig when the soil is fairly dry, so you should also avoid digging after heavy rainfall.;  , A sharp pair of pruning shears and a small saw will make the job of clearing the shrub a lot easier – remember sharp blades are safer than blunt ones.  A round-bladed spade with a pointed tip will make it easier to dig through the soil, and a mattock will be useful for cutting through the roots.  Also remember to wear appropriate clothing – including sturdy gardening gloves and strong boots.  Use the pruning shears to cut the shrub right back until only a small amount of stump is remaining.  This will make it much easier for you to expose the root ball and pull it out of the ground, which is necessary for completely clearing the shrub.  Leaving the shrub's roots in the ground will simply allow the shrub to grow back. , Use the round-bladed spade to dig a trench around the stump. Beware of digging close to water or electricity supplies.  Consider calling 811 (the national 'call before you dig' service) to find out if any utility lines run beneath that part of your garden.  Using the spade and mattock, cut through the roots as much as possible to make it easier to pull the root mass out of the ground.  Although it's only necessary to remove the root head and main roots to prevent the shrub from re-growing, you should also remove as much of the rest of the root mass as you can to make space for subsequent planting.  Shaking the soil out of the roots will make the plant lighter to handle.  Once you have cut away the shrub and pulled up the root mass, you can dispose of the plant material anyway you like. If the shrub is small enough, you could try to compost it, otherwise you should consider burning it.  Don’t compost any diseased plant matter you cut away – burn it or put it in the household trash to prevent infection spreading to other plants.  Once you have disposed of the root ball, use a mattock or spade to break up as much of the remaining root in the ground as you can – breaking the root up will help it to rot away naturally in the soil.  It’s also a good idea to incorporate some well-rotted manure or compost into the soil now to benefit the next plant that will go in the ground here.  Another approach that involves less digging is to wrap a length of chain around the root stump and pull it from the ground using a car jack or a towing vehicle.  It will help if you can mattock out the roots a little to dislodge the root from the ground.  You’ll need to be aware of where your water and power lines are to avoid accidentally damaging these.  Cut off the majority of the shrub above ground, leaving only a fairly short length of stump above ground. Purchase a glyphosate-based shrub killing chemical treatments from the garden store.  This treatment needs to be applied fairly soon after cutting – it won’t work on an old stump that’s been sitting in the garden for years. Handle carefully and follow manufacturers instructions.  Treat the stump over the autumn and winter, when the sap isn't rising. It may be necessary to drill holes in the woody stump to pour the treatment into.  You’ll need to have considerable patience as the stump may take a good while to die away and the area will not be suitable for immediate replanting.  Although you might want rid of your shrub, there may be someone in your local area who would love to have it.  You might try advertising on a local message board such as Gumtree or Craigslist to see if anyone wants a free shrub and is prepared to dig it out and collect it. Take a good digital photo and you may be surprised who’s interested!  , Prepare the ground at the new location well by incorporating lots of well-rotted manure or compost. It’s best to do this well ahead of time if possible. Dig up the shrub to be moved in the, fall after the leaves have dropped off, or in early springtime, before new ones form.  This is important, as it will allow you to transfer the shrub as quickly as possible, which prevents the roots from getting stressed or dried out.  In order to dig a new hole, it's important to get an idea of the size of the shrub's roots. This will ensure that the new hole is big enough. To do this, take a tape measure and find a point on the main trunk of the shrub that is 15 centimeter (5.9 in) above the ground.  Measure the trunk diameter at this point. Multiply that by ten to get the size of the root diameter. Once you have the root diameter, you can dig a hole of the same diameter or larger.  If your soil type is sandy, give the shrub a good watering two or three days before moving it. This will help preserve the root mass when you dig it up.  Dig the root ball out with the back of your spade facing the plant. You can move it to its new location by placing it on an old sheet or tarpaulin which you can drag across the ground.  If you don't have time to replant the shrub immediately, you will need to tie up the branches of the shrub to protect them. Start at the bottom and use a spiral wrapping movement to wrap the branches against the trunk.  Make the roots as compact as possible but avoid damaging the branches by tying too tightly.  Lower the shrub's root ball into its new location and cover with soil. Don’t tamp the soil down with your feet as this can damage the roots.Water the shrub well until it's established in its new position.  ","choose the right time of year to dig up large shrubs. gather the necessary tools and materials. cut the shrub back to expose the stump. dig a trench around the stump to expose the root ball. pull out the root ball. dispose of the pulled-up shrub. break up any remaining root and add some compost. pull the shrub out of the ground using a chain. kill off the shrub using chemicals. find out if anyone is interested in collecting the shrub. plan to relocate your shrub in autumn or spring. prepare the hole at the new location before removing the shrub from its old location. water the shrub before relocating it. dig up the root ball. replant the shrub.

"You will need to use a spiralizer. A spiralizer looks similar to a very large pencil sharpener. Before use, peel the vegetable. Then, hold the vegetable in place with the clamp over the grinder. Use the hand crank to feed the vegetable through the spiralizer. Spiralize the radish, zucchini, and cucumber until you have long, curled ribbons.You can also use any other spiral vegetable slicing tool if you don’t have a spiralizer.  You can cut the vegetable noodles in half with a knife if you think they’re too long.;  , First, chop up the six to eight green onions with a chef’s knife. Then, chop up the three bell peppers. Make sure you remove the stem and seeds. Next, slice up the half white onion. Finish by julienning the four carrots.To julienne, cut the carrots into short, thin strips.  Once all of the vegetables have been spiralized or cut, add them to a large mixing bowl. Leave out a few of the chopped vegetables to top the salad. Mix the vegetables together by gently tossing the contents of the bowl., An avocado ranch dressing is recommended for this zoodle salad. You can make your own dressing, or buy it at the store. Pour the dressing over the salad. Mix the dressing and salad together with your hands or salad tongs until it has been thoroughly combined., Take the chopped vegetables that you set aside and put them on top of the salad. Then, serve the salad immediately. You can store the salad covered in the refrigerator for about one day.

"Before you actually go shopping for a living Christmas tree, take the following into consideration:  Tree digging stops once the ground freezes. Unless you can find a nursery or farm that carries pre-potted trees, you'll have to do your shopping before the ground in your area freezes. This means you may have to purchase the tree several weeks before Christmas and find a proper place to store it, such as a patio. It can't be kept indoors for any more than 7 to 10 days or else it may die.3-5 days indoors is preferable so that the buds remain dormant and the tree avoids 'winter kill' when moved outside.Consider when the tree can be planted. In some areas, the holiday season is an ideal time to plant trees. If this is not the case in your region, the tree will need to be stored and cared for outdoors until a good planting time arrives.  Make sure that the tree will fit into your landscape and that the type of tree you are considering will ultimately thrive in your local environment. Some trees used as Christmas trees will eventually reach heights of 40 to 60 feet (12.2 to 18.3 m)! If coniferous trees are uncommon in your area, the environment may not be conducive to them (e.g. arid regions) and you'll have to look for drought-tolerant species (e.g. Arizona cypress). If you don't want to plant the tree on your property, find a neighbor, friend or organization who does want it, and make an agreement before you purchase the tree.  Keep in mind that living trees are much heavier than cut trees because they come with roots and soil that must be kept constantly moist. For example, a 5–6 foot (1.5–1.8 m) tall balled and burlapped tree can weight up to 200 lbs!It may not be wise to purchase a living tree if you can't move it around without hurting yourself or damaging the tree (e.g. bad back, small doorways, stairs). If you anticipate difficulty moving the tree, consider buying a small, container tree.;  , Make a list of local nurseries, garden centers, retail lots and choose-and-cut farms. Call ahead and ask if they have any container trees, or if they are willing to dig up a tree for you (instead of cutting it) and how much that will cost (or you can offer to dig the tree up yourself). Find out if you can order a tree to be picked up a few days before Christmas.If they have living Christmas trees available, visit to check the condition of the trees.  Whether they're in the ground, recently dug, or container grown, you should carefully inspect the trees to make sure they're healthy.  Feel the soil with your fingertips. It should be soft and moist. If it's hard and dry, it means the tree hasn't been watered properly. This may indicate poor practices on the part of the nursery or farm, so you may want to look elsewhere.  Check the firmness of the root ball if the tree's roots are bound in burlap. It should be tightly packed. Trees with loose root balls are less likely to survive.  Observe the needles. When shopping for any real Christmas tree, living or cut, you should run your hand gently along the branches. No more than a few needles should drop. Most of the needles should be green and firm, not brittle, yellowing or brown.  Bend a branch gently. It should bend flexibly, not snap.  Look for live buds.  Determine the type of tree you're looking at. Most cut Christmas trees are Douglas and balsam fir, pine and spruce. Normally, the type wouldn't matter other than in terms of aesthetics, but since you might be planting this tree in your backyard, you'll want to consider how this particular type will fare in your environment.  If all you can find is a tree farm, you may need to dig the tree yourself. If someone else is doing the digging, you can watch carefully to make sure it's being done properly. Otherwise, the tree's chances of survival can be severely decreased through incorrect digging.  Make a circular trench that's a foot deep and six inches out beyond the drip line (where the tree's outermost branches will drip water onto the ground).  Start from the outside in. Towards the trunk, you will encounter roots that dive into the ground--a small saw may be needed to cut these.  Work a tarp in between the severed roots and the soil and use the tarp to hoist the tree onto a burlap square, which can be tied tightly around the roots.  When handling the tree, lift it carefully by the roots (not by the trunk). When you put it down, do so gently--don't let the roots hit the ground forcefully.  ","think ahead. shop around. inspect the trees. dig the tree properly. handle the tree carefully. "

"You'll want to ensure that you are establishing an environment that is ideal for your toddler to feel comfortable and happy. Even if you have set up a playdate and the other child is friendly, don’t force your child to play. You can try to encourage them by playing with them or addressing any of their immediate concerns like having to go potty, but don’t make them play if they are not in the mood., Though your toddler may be very social, remember that a lot of children have difficulty sharing. If possible, put out two of each toy so that each child can have the same item to play with. This can cut down on a lot of potential arguments or tantrums.You can also provide large toys. Your toddler will be able to share this toy with another toddler. This might be a set of building blocks or a swing set in your backyard.  Consider mixing the toys altogether. Allow your children to freely play without much structure.  Avoid introducing your child’s favorite toy to the mix unless they are typically a good sharer.  Group activities will give your child a chance to interact with other children. You can also help your toddler make friends by providing activities during their playdates. Perhaps you'll want to set up a mini soccer arena for them in your house or backyard, or a painting studio for them to create art.This will help even the shyest child interact more.  Most children benefit from having some outdoor time each day. Schedule your child’s playdate at a park, or consider going on a walk with the children. Your toddler will have fun and you will be able to get a bit of exercise in.  ","don’t force them to play. double up on toys. find group activities, instead of toys they play with individually. go to the park or on a walk. "
"A lot of people will dismiss challenges that come before them. They’ll convince themselves that the problem is smaller than it really is or that it doesn’t exist in the first place. You need to recognize when you start thinking this way because it’s true what they say: the first step in overcoming a problem is admitting that you have one.  This isn’t a fun part of the equation. Accepting that this challenge is real and that you’re going to have to deal with it can be really scary. If you’re scared of what this challenge can mean for you, just remember: so far in life, you’ve met every challenge that’s come before you and made it out okay. There’s no reason to think that this is any different.;  , It’s important, with any challenge that you end up facing, to start doing something about the problem as soon as you possibly can. Each moment of inaction becomes an action in itself. By doing nothing, you’re still doing something. And that something probably isn’t helping the situation. Problems usually multiply when left to themselves, like rabbits. The sooner you start facing the challenge, the easier it will be to overcome.  So, you’re ready to start tackling this challenge? Great! The best place to start is by evaluating the facts. What do you really know about what’s going on? Are you sure you understand the situation? Don’t just deal with what you think the problem is; the real issue might be something you didn’t even realize was a problem. Take some time to make sure that you understand the situation as fully as possible.  This usually means that you’re going to have to talk to people, although who will depend on your situation. Are you having problems with school? Talk to your teacher. Problems at work? Talk to your boss or a coworker. Problems in your relationship? Talk to your partner. Problems with your health? Talk to your doctor. You get the idea.  It can help to make a list. A challenge is rarely one single task or problem, but is instead made up of lots of different parts. Make a list talking about what the smaller, sub-challenges are and what you’ll need to do in order to combat them.  Now that you know what you’re dealing with, you’ll want to think about what tools and resources you have available to help you in facing this challenge. What resources are most important will depend on your problem, but there are lots of things you can consider. Think about your strengths, the people that can help you, and any physical resources you might have (like money). You should also think about areas in which you are weak. This will let you plan ahead so that you can compensate or at least be prepared in areas where something might go wrong. Be realistic about both the good and bad things that you have to offer this situation: fantastic optimism is not your friend here.  For example, let’s say that you’re facing a challenge in your marriage. What do you have that can help you face this? Well, you’re good at communicating how you feel. That’s important for reaching understanding in interpersonal issues. You also have your parents available to you, as they’ve managed to stay together through some pretty serious fights. They might have some advice. You also know that you’re not good at changing your habits, so you’ll know that you’ll need to be prepared to pay extra attention to that.  Now that you know about what the facts of the situation and what you have available to you, you can start finding information that can help you. Find out more about the challenge you’re facing. Talk to people that have faced the same challenge. The more you know about the facts, similar situations, and the experiences of others, the easier time you’ll have making smart decisions about facing your own challenge. It’ll also help keep you from feeling alone.  You can find a lot of information by going online and using Google to find websites that deal with your specific problem.  For example, let’s say that you’re facing a challenge at work; you are up for review and you’re worried that your performance has been poor. Now, go to Google and search for performance reviews. You’ll learn about the process and hear how things have gone for other people. You can also learn about what you can do to improve your chances for keeping your job if your review goes badly.  When we’re worried, we tend to see only a few paths out of a challenge. You might see your situation as “either I do this or I do that”. However, this is rarely an accurate view of the situation and thinking of it in this way can often be harmful to your decision-making process. Challenge your ideas of what is really necessary to the situation or what your options really are. Find the paths between the ones that are so clearly marked in your mind. You may find that a middle road or a total detour is better for you in the long run, even if it doesn’t match what you thought the situation would be.  If you’re having a hard time looking at a situation and finding an alternative route, one of the easiest ways to get ideas is to talk to someone you trust. Get advice. If you’re on your own though, look at you main goal point (the thing you’re trying to reach). It’s got a problem in the way, keeping you from getting there, right? Now, look at the actual function of the goal. Is there another way to get the same thing to happen? This can open another path for you to take.  If the challenge you’re facing in any way involves other people, then a large part of your challenge can be dealt with by talking to other people. Most of our problems come up in the first place because we fail to communicate in the way that we should.  For example, let’s say that you’re having problems in your relationship. The best way to solve relationship problems is to talk to your significant other. Be honest about how you feel and what you want and encourage them to do the same. If they won’t talk with you, well that kind of answers the question, doesn’t it?  Another example would be if you’re having problems at school. Talk to your teacher or the school’s counselor. No matter what the problem is, one of them should have some ideas that can help you. You might think that they might be mad at you, judge you, or make things worse, but that is very likely not true. You’re very unlikely to tell them something that would surprise them and they’ll have a lot more experience in handling the problem and will probably have some good ideas for you.  When you’re facing a challenge, one thing you can do to really transform your experience of the situation is to find a mentor. This can be a person, a website, a book: anything that can give you advice on your specific situation and inspire you to take it like a champ. Having a mentor can make your experience more positive and help you change how you experience what’s happening to you.  For example, if you’re having problems with a friend, talk to your older sister. She’ll probably have had similar troubles at some point in her life, so she’ll be able to give you advice. She’ll also be able to support and comfort you.  Online communities can also fill this role, so don’t worry if you’re not that great at talking to people or asking for help face-to-face.  The final key for dealing with challenges in your life is to just keep trying. You have to be persistent. Without being persistent, you’ll frequently find yourself unsuccessful in the things you try. We won’t recommend trying the same approach over and over again but you shouldn’t give up on finding a solution. Every challenge can be met and every situation made better, so long as you keep your mind open.  Now sometimes the solution to a challenge is accepting the inevitable. Let’s say that your challenge is that you’ve been diagnosed with a chronic illness. Now, you shouldn’t keep fighting to get rid of the illness. The reality is probably that you’re stuck with it. However, the solution in this situation would be that you should find a sense of community and identity with others who share your situation and learn to better embrace and appreciate the good things that you do have in your life.  So you’ve got this incredible challenge before you: now you need to really face it. How do you deal, how do you cope, when this very upsetting thing is happening to you? It’s very important to remember that time passes and things change. Always. The only constant is that the sun will rise each morning. Whatever you’re dealing with, however terrible and permanent it feels, it’s important to remember that you will not always feel this way. Your challenge will not be there forever. A new reality will form and you will find a way to keep living. Just keep telling yourself: This too shall pass.  For example, your boyfriend that you’ve been with since you were young might have just left you. It will feel horrible, like you’ll never be happy again and you’ll never find someone else that you love that much. It might feel like you’ll never find anyone. But time will pass, you’ll be out at a party, and then suddenly...your prince charming will walk into the room. He’ll be funny and charming and he’ll think you’re just the most incredible thing to grace this Earth. It’ll happen. You just need to be patient and give it time.  When bad things happen to us or when we’re stressed, we tend to forget about all of the wonderful things that exist in our lives. No matter how bad things seem, the world really is a wonderful place. Take account of the good things in your life. Spend time enjoying them and tell the people that love you how much you love them in return. Not only will this keep you sane during this challenging time, it might also help you find a way to take on your challenge.  People sometimes have a hard time seeing the good things in their life. Don’t let this happen to you. You don’t have a significant other? You do still have friends and family. Not much in the way of friends and family? You’re alive and you have the wonderful opportunity to go out into the world and make friends and have experiences. There’s always some incredible experience that’s just waiting for you to get up and take it.  No matter what challenge you’re facing, being flexible will make a huge difference in helping you face it. See yourself as a tree that’s fallen in a river. You can try to go against the flow, but you’ll end up struggling and you’ll bang against every rock on the way. If instead you go with the flow, change with each direction that the river wants to take you, you’ll glide smoothly until it carries you to a resting place.  When you have a goal or find some kind of greater meaning in your life, you’ll find that facing any challenge is easier. This is because it gives you something to work towards, hope for, or will simply inspire you and make you happy. There are lots of ways to go about this. You can set a goal, like that you want to buy a house in five years. Some people become more religious and find comfort in their religious community. Some people volunteer and find strength in helping others. Find something that works for you.  Finding meaning if you don’t have meaning can be tricky. The best way to go about it, as with most things in life, is to give it a try. When you find the right thing for you, you’ll know it. Just keep yourself open to as many possibilities as possible and don’t keep yourself from getting out there and trying things.  Handling stress takes practice. You’ll find that you have an easier time facing challenges if you face more of them. When you keep yourself sheltered and always take the easy route in life to avoid the challenges, you’ll never show yourself that you can in fact face a challenge. Let challenges happen. Take risks that have promising rewards. You’ll find that you can do more than you give yourself credit for.  It’s a bit like learning to ride a bike: you have to get up on the bike and you might get a few scrapes and bruises while you learn to keep your balance, but each wobble will teach you something about staying upright. If every time you wobble you get off the bike and stay off for a few years, you’re never going to learn.  When you do face challenges in your life, be grateful for them. Each challenge you face will teach you more about yourself. It will become a part of who you are...and that person is an incredible person. You are unique and wonderful and it is your challenges that have made you that way. You might be struggling right now but remember, even while you’re worrying and upset, that this challenge is going to make you a better person.  The most important thing you can do for facing any challenge is to believe in yourself. When you doubt yourself, you’ll falter. You’ll make poor decisions. You want to make good decisions! Not believing in yourself can also powerfully transform what you take away from this experience. Either you believe in yourself and what you take away is ultimately good and you learn from it...or you don’t believe in yourself and this experience is negative because you see it as a failure on your part. Which experience would you rather have?  Sometimes, life has been so unkind that we really don’t want to believe in ourselves. Please, don’t let your experiences diminish your wonderful spirit. You are so strong. Look at all the stuff that you’ve made it through so far! We know that you can face this challenge and do so with grace. We believe in you and we are so proud of the person that you are. Just keep trying and don’t forget to be awesome.  ","accept that this challenge is happening. take action. evaluate the facts. take account of what you have. find more information. look at all possibilities. communicate, communicate, communicate. look for a mentor. keep trying until you find a solution. recognize that this too shall pass. remind yourself of the good things in your life. be flexible, always. find meaning in your life. let yourself be challenged. be grateful for the challenges you have. believe in yourself.

"Before you hold a disciplinary meeting for an employee, it's imperative that you thoroughly review the incident at hand. The investigation may entail interviewing other employees or witnesses for details on the incident. Make sure a representative from Human Resources is present during all interviews.Ask anyone you interview to sign an accurately-written dictation of their statement.  Compile and review the evidence for and against the employee. If the evidence overwhelmingly suggests that the employee was at fault, you'll need to proceed to disciplinary proceedings.  Document everything that is said about the incident and about the employee, including by the employee himself or herself.For minor infractions or first-time offenses, an informal, verbal warning is usually sufficient. For more serious infractions or repeat offenses, a formal disciplinary meeting may be called for.;  , Your employee has a right to know that an investigation is being conducted and may lead to a disciplinary meeting. You do not want to withhold this information, as blindsiding an employee with disciplinary measures typically violates most companies' human resources policies., Once you've decided to proceed with a disciplinary meeting, you'll need to make arrangements for the actual meeting. Choose a date and time that is convenient for your schedule and is feasible for the employee's schedule (for example, at a time when the employee is scheduled to be in the office).  The location of the meeting should be someplace private that will not be interrupted. Privacy is important for both following protocol and maintaining workplace morale.  After you've reserved a location for the meeting and scheduled a date and time, you'll need to inform your employee. The employee's notice should be delivered in writing so that they have a written document that details the incident and the coming procedure.The notice should include the details of the allegation. It should also notify the employee of the date, time, and location of the disciplinary meeting, as well as any attendees who will be present.  Depending on your employer's policies and the rules that pertain to disciplinary hearings, you may also be required to allow the employee to bring a union representative or work colleague. This should be mentioned in the written notice.  It's best to have a representative from human resources (HR) present at any and all disciplinary meetings. This is beneficial to both the employee and to you as the manager.Employees may see an HR representative's presence as a form of protection against unfair disciplinary proceedings.  As a manager, you may want an HR representative there to serve as a witness.  It's best to begin the meeting by reminding the employee of what they did wrong. Whether it's a behavioral problem or a job performance issue, reviewing what happened and why it was a problem is an imperative first step in the disciplinary process.Be clear and complete in your summary of the allegations/infractions. Do not leave out any details, and make sure the employee understands what incident is being reviewed and why.  If the allegations involve some infraction of the law, you may not be able to disclose all the details to the employee. This is particularly true if a criminal investigation is ongoing or pending.  Consult with a police officer before proceeding if the employee is or may be under criminal investigation.  After reiterating the allegations against the employee, it's a good idea to contrast that behavior with the prescribed standards of conduct and performance at your company. This will help clarify what the employee did wrong and what should have been done differently. Reviewing the standards also helps protect management from any allegations that the employee was unclear on the rules. It reminds the employee that the rules are clearly written and available to all employees., Now that the employee has been reminded of what should have been done differently and why, you'll want to inform the employee of what your company can legally do to reprimand that infraction. The employee should be clear on what management can and cannot do in response to the bad behavior, and you should lay out all of the disciplinary options available at your disposal.While you may not have arrived at a ruling on the matter, it's important that the employee understands what may end up happening after the proceedings.  Reviewing the company's disciplinary policy also helps protect management from allegations of unfair treatment.  The decision in your disciplinary meeting will depend on the nature of your employee's infraction/misconduct as well as the disciplinary policy in place at your company. In general, minor infractions warrant minor disciplinary measures, while more serious infractions warrant more serious measures.  Serious infractions may include theft, assault, or significant acts of insubordination.Maintain the notes you take as you deliberate on a decision. These notes and any supporting documents from the investigation and meeting should be kept in either the employee's personnel file or in a secure, locked location.  Once you've arrived at a decision, you'll need to inform your employee of what will happen next. Depending on your company's policies, you may want to deliver the decision in writing to the employee, or at least offer a written explanation in addition to a verbal announcement.Keep the decision confidential. The only people you should tell are the employee, their union representative (if they have one), and the HR representative who served as a witness.  If the employee is to be suspended, a short, follow-up suspension meeting should be scheduled.  Different employers may have different disciplinary policies, but in general, a verbal warning is the first form of discipline. Verbal warnings are usually followed by written reprimands, suspension, and eventual termination., The goal of disciplinary proceedings is not to punish the employee so much as to correct bad behavior and performance issues. As such, you may need to give your employee some reminders from time to time on what they should be doing differently.Give clear examples. Describe what should have been done differently in the incident that was investigated, and provide hypothetical examples of similar situations.  Don't be overbearing and don't correct your employee in front of their coworkers. Assess the situation and ask to speak in private as needed.  As time goes on, your employee should have learned from the disciplinary meeting. They should implement the changes you've recommended, and their behavior (whether good or bad) should be monitored over time.Look for both improvements and future infractions. Praise the employee for corrected behavior, and give verbal input on behavior that still needs to be corrected.  If the employee's behavior or performance does not change to meet the company's expectations, future conversations may be necessary with the employee. These conversations may lead to further disciplinary meetings, or they could be as simple as offering feedback and guidance, depending on the nature of the infraction and the employee's response to feedback.  ","conduct an investigation into the incident. keep the employee informed of the investigation. schedule a date, time, and location for the meeting. give the employee written notice of the meeting. have an hr representative present. reiterate the allegations against the employee. review the standards of conduct or performance. outline the company's disciplinary policy. arrive at a decision. inform the employee of your decision. inform the employee of what to do differently. monitor the employee's performance after the meeting. arrange for follow-up meetings as needed.

"How you feel about yourself may not be accurately be represented as fact. Do not believe everything you tell yourself.  To change negative thought patterns, try the cognitive behavioral technique “the 3 C’s”: catch, check, change. Catch yourself thinking something negative about yourself, check if what you are thinking about is true, and then change your thoughts to more positive one., People who make you feel bad about yourself will make it more difficult to find self-love. If you find yourself surrounded by people like this, it is time to consider distancing yourself.It might be difficult to completely disappear or disengage from people. Start slow. If you want to distance yourself from friends, for example, try to communicate less. Gradually stop seeing or talking to them, and then block them on social media.  Breaking up with someone who is a negative influence can be a bit trickier. However, if you can handle it, then your life can be much better.  Negative situations can create negative behavior and may create self-hatred.Avoiding these situations will remove the stimuli and will help you focus on making a better you.  For example, you can’t control the weather. Why let it upset you? When it comes to things about yourself, there are just some things you will not be able to control (such as past decisions). Focus on the things you can.  Feeling inadequate is very common. You must recognize that you cannot excel at every aspect of your life. Imperfection is part of the human condition. Recognize this to begin loving yourself and what you do accomplish.  ","recognize opinions do not equal facts. avoid negative people. stay away from negative situations. do not to dwell on things you can not change. avoid thinking that you aren’t good enough. "
"Write your toddler’s name at the top – “Jane’s Morning Routine at Age 4” or “John’s Daily Routine at Age 4”. You can make it colorful by using different colored markers or you can use just one color.  You can also use felt letters that you can buy from craft stores or bookstores that come in different colors and paste them to the paper.  A chart that depicts making the bed, dressing up, brushing teeth, breakfast and bathing will have four vertical lines.  These days should run Monday through Sunday. These horizontal lines should intersect each of the vertical lines that you drew.  You should have something that looks like a giant graph paper after drawing these horizontal lines.  Place your toddler’s pictures at the top in a row according to what she will need to do first every morning. The order may go: making the bed, dressing up, brushing teeth, breakfast, bathing, playing and reading.  Tape the chart to the wall of your toddler’s bedroom. Once this is done, you can make the routine charts for the afternoon, and bedtime.  For the afternoon routine chart, you can place pictures of your toddler taking a nap, then eating a snack then walking in the park or playing in the playground.  For the bedtime routine, place pictures of your child eating dinner, brushing teeth, bathing, reading a book and sleeping in her bed.

"Another way you can clip your cat’s nails is to use a regular pair of human nail clippers. These work almost just as well as guillotine clippers. Just make sure that the clippers are sharp enough to cut the nails.You should not use the nail clippers on yourself after using them on your cat. Instead, buy a different pair to use just for your cat.  To clip the claw with human nail clippers, place the clippers perpendicular to the claw. Don’t cut the nail sideways because it will not cut as easily and may end up jagged and splintered. Slide the nail between the two blades and squeeze the clippers., Scissor clippers look like scissors, except they have a curved edge on the blades. Many vets use scissor trimmers.Scissor clippers are generally smaller than guillotine trimmers. This means they may be difficult to use and hold if you have larger hands. Scissor clippers may be better for smaller hands.Because of the way the trimmers are shaped, scissor trimmers are helpful to clip nails that have grown so long they are curling and growing into the toe pad., When using scissor clippers, make sure you place the nail into the blade the correct way. The scissors have a sharp curved edge. Place the bottom of the nail against the blade so you will cut the top and bottom.This prevents splintering and fraying. If you cut the nail side to side with the scissor blades, the nail will split.  Make sure to keep the nail clippers or scissor clippers sharp. Dull clippers can leave a rough, jagged edge. If the clippers leave a jagged edge, use a nail file to smooth out the rough edges.  ","use a human nail clipper. slide the nail between the blades. try scissor clippers. place the bottom of the nail against the blade. use a nail file to smooth rough edges. "
"Nothing is worse than having to run to the hardware store in the middle of a project. See the list of things you need below.;  , Usually a soggy area of grass, but sometimes it is a geyser.  , Not the whole pipe, just the section that is broken. Carefully remove the section of grass above the pipe, trying to keep it intact. Do this by cutting a circular section with the end of your shovel above where you are to dig then carefully lifting it off. Dig up the dirt above the bad pipe with a shovel (you will probably also need a hand trowel to dig up the dirt under the pipe). You will want to have at least 6 inches (15.2 cm) on each side of the break clear and enough room for you fist underneath the pipe. If the hole fills with water, you will either have to wait for it to dry or bail it out (the latter is recommended).  Get a hacksaw, PVC or metal pipe cutters (depending on what type of pipe you have, older sprinkler systems are usually metal, while newer ones tend to be PVC). Cut the broken section out so that you have clean, undamaged pipe on both sides.  It should probably be 1/2 ' to 1' shorter to allow room for the connectors. Or you can buy a PVC fitting from most home improvement stores that has one pipe sliding inside an outer barrel with an O-ring inside. It will extend almost 3' in length. I have seen in stores 1/2' to 2 1/2' in diameter sizes. One end is a female slip and the other is a male that needs a coupling, elbow, or tee to connect to complete the repair.  Some water will come pouring out at first, you could try to catch it, but it is easier to bail it out. Once the water stops coming out, clean both ends with a rag.  If you are lucky enough to have PVC then you just put the PVC primer and glue on the outside of the pipe and inside of the straight connectors and slip them together. Work quickly because the glue sets fast. Then put the section you just glued in the gap you just created, repeating the gluing procedure. If you have metal pipes you will have to thread the outside of the pipe to fit the connectors rather than gluing them.  Turn the sprinklers back on and make sure it is sealed properly.  ","buy supplies. find the rupture. turn off the sprinklers, if you don’t this could be a very hard task. , dig up the pipe. cut the pipe. measure a new length of pipe that is just a bit shorter than the gap left by old pipe that you cut away. clean the pipe. fit the new section. test the pipe. if everything is fixed, cover up the hole and replace the grass you so carefully removed before.

"You will typically have to adjust the finger pick or picks before playing. To do this, first put the finger pick on the end of your index finger. The collar of the finger pick should be between the end of your finger and the first joint. The part that picks the instrument should be facing down. Musicians will often wear three picks at a time. If that’s the case, put the other two picks on your thumb and middle finger.If you’re wearing three picks, it’s a good idea to use two metal picks and one plastic pick to get a range of sound.  The collar of the pick should not actually be on the joint of your finger.  First, hold both sides of the collar of the pick with your opposite index finger and thumb. Give the finger pick a squeeze. Squeeze the pick until the pick is snug, but not too tight on your finger.The finger pick should extend slightly past the end of your finger.  You don’t have to do this if you are happy with the way the pick fits. If you want the pick to bend with the curve of your finger, you will need to bend the blade. You can do this by pushing the end of the pick on a hard surface, like a table, while wearing it.It may be more difficult to bend the pick if it is pretty thick.  ","place the pick on the end of your index finger. form the pick to your finger. try to bend the blade if you want the pick to curve with your finger. "

"Steam cleaning can help to refresh your skin and help to sooth problem areas on your face, such as a deep pimple. You can also integrate essential oils in your steam clean to help “draw” out the deep pimple. You will need to following supplies:  1-quart pot  Water  A clean towel  Essential oils  Dried herbs, if you do not have access to essential oils  , You should use essential oils that have antibacterial or antiseptic properties and that can help to sooth the deep pimples.  Spearmint or peppermint: Due to a high percentage of menthol, spearmint or peppermint has antiseptic and immune boosting properties.Thyme: This herb can improve your immune system and is known to be antibacterial. It is also known to increase your blood circulation.Lavender: This herb has soothing and calming properties. It also has antibacterial properties and can help with anxiety and depression.Calendula: This herb can help to accelerate healing and also has antimicrobial properties.Always pre-test the oil on a small area of your skin before you use it. This will confirm you are not allergic to the herbal oil. To test the oil, place one drop on your wrist and wait 10–15 minutes. Only use the oil for steam cleaning if there is no reaction on the surface of your skin.  Use a hair tie to put your hair back so your face is exposed. Then, wash your face with a plant-oil based product. This will ensure it is clean and ready for steaming. Use oils like glycerin, grapeseed, and sunflower to create a plant-oil based product.  Use your fingertips to apply the product to your face, gently massaging in circular motions. Wash your face for about a minute and then use lukewarm water to rinse your face, removing the cleanser.  Pat your face dry with a clean towel.  Use the 1-quart pot and fill it halfway with water. Place it on the stove and let it boil for one to two minutes. Make sure the water creates a nice flow of steam.  Add one to two drops of the essential oils. Use dried herbs if you do not have access to herbal oils. Use ½ teaspoon of dried herbs per quart of water.  Allow the water to boil for another minute and then take it off the heat. Be careful, as the pot will be hot. Shut off the stove and put the pot on an even surface in an open area.  Cover your head with the towel first so you can position your face 12–15 inches from the water. Doing this will cause your blood vessels to dilate and your pores to open up without damaging your skin with the steam.  Close your eyes and breathe in and out deeply. Relax and be calm as the steam wafts over your face.  One minute in, remove your face from the steam and let your skin rest for 10 minutes. Only reheat the water and steam again if you do not have an allergic reaction to the oils in the steam after 10 minutes, with no sneezing or itching.  Hold your face over the steam for up to 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, remove your face from the steam and rinse your skin with lukewarm water. Pat dry it with a towel.  End the steam session by hydrating your face with natural oils or a non-comedogenic moisturizer. This will keep your skin soft and prevent damage to your skin.  Go for store-brand moisturizers that are labeled non-comedogenic or non-clogging, like Olay, Neutrogena, and Clinique moisturizers.  For a natural option, go for natural oils that are high in non-comedogenic properties, such as hemp seed oil, shea butter, sunflower oil, castor oil, calendula oil, or argan oil.Begin by moisturizing your face twice a day with natural oils, in the morning and at night. Do the steam treatment once a day, in the morning or the evening.

"It not only captures their attention but also makes it easier for you to start a conversation. You may also have a higher chance of being paired up together, and you can discuss assignments and tests with them. You'll also be able to comment on what they say without looking weird.  There are a variety of different topics that you can talk about, but you can mostly focus on the ones that your crush is interested in. Try to come up with a new subject every time you talk to them. That way, they'll see you as an interesting, fun person and perhaps look forward to your conversations. You could also try asking them for help with a task, even if you don't need assistance. As long as it's believable, it should work as long as you don't do this too frequently. However, be sure that you show that you're intelligent. For instance, if you're a math whiz, don't ask your crush questions related to math.  You could also your crush about an assignment, which may open the way up to other subjects. Even if you're not in the same class, ask your crush about their lessons or what homework they have. However, be sure to talk about other topics so that you don't exhaust the current one.  In order to show them that you care, lend them pencils, paper, or any other supplies that they may need. Allow them to cry on your shoulder if something bad happens to them, and show them that you are a kind person. Be sure that you don't overdo it; otherwise, they may take advantage of your generosity.  A simple 'hello' might lead to a conversation. Even if you don't have time to talk to them, quickly greet them to show that you're thinking of them. It may also grab their attention and cause them to think of you.  Add your crush to Facebook or other social networks you're both on. This is especially recommended if you both have mutual friends. This can lead the way to conversations outside of school, and you may be invited to events.  Now that you're talking to your crush, subtly flirt with them. This will help you get a sense of how interested they are in you, and you'll also show that you're attracted to them. If you get a positive response, continue flirting a bit and slowly increase it. However, if you feel that they aren't interested, tone it down a bit.  Although you may be attracted to them, you need to focus on your own life. They are just a person, and if they don't show interest, move on. No person is worth that much effort.  ","sit next to your crush. initiate conversations with your crush. start conversations with school-related topics. be kind to your crush. greet them. connect on social media. flirt. understand that your crush is human.

"This will refresh your memory and allow you to evaluate what you've already got, and what you need to add. While you read, ask yourself some questions:  What is the goal of the story? In other words, what do you want your readers to take away from it?  Do you want a surprise ending? An abrupt ending? An inconclusive or open-ended ending? A happily-ever-after ending?;  , Is it literary fiction? Science fiction? Romance? The genre of your story may help you decide what types of ending are most appropriate. Your ending should be related to what the rest of your story has promised your readers.If you're not sure what types of endings are most conventional for the genre you've chosen, pick a popular author (like Stephen King for horror or Flannery O'Connor for literary fiction) and read a couple of their stories. You can learn a lot from reading how other authors end their work.  Write short descriptive sentences that summarize each scene or important plot point. For example: 'Larry goes to the store to buy bread, but forgets his wallet. He returns to the house and discovers a stranger sitting on his front porch.' This outline will help you figure out the 'bones' of your story: what happens, with whom, etc., which will come in handy when trying to decide on an ending.  This part doesn't have to take the form of complete, polished sentences just yet. Your goal here is to produce a bunch of possibilities, so write down any and all of your ideas, no matter how vague, silly, or unconventional they may seem. There are many ways to brainstorm your ideas, so try out a few techniques and see what works best for you!  It can be helpful to draw a 'mind map,' either with pen and paper or on a computer. Start with what you know about your story -- characters, events, settings -- and assign each element its own bubble. Begin to add details and questions, drawing connecting lines between bubbles to show how your ideas relate to each other.You may also try writing down some keywords on index cards or small pieces of paper. Try putting your cards together in different combinations and see if you like what happens!  , As you consider your ideas, look for themes, patterns, and repetitions. Are there ideas or characters that seem particularly important? Your ending will likely need to deal with those.  If you're having trouble picking a direction, try making a list of what your characters want. Characters with strong wants or needs are more compelling to your audience. Famous author Kurt Vonnegut once said that 'Every character should want something, even if it is only a glass of water.'Ask yourself: Have your characters achieved their desires, or not? What could be the consequences of where your characters are now?  If you're still stuck, try figuring out what problems or themes your story has introduced. If there's a problem, how can it be resolved?(You could think about something like the Harry Potter books here: if the problem is Voldemort wanting to take over the world, what is the resolution?)  , Once you've thought about which direction you want your story to take and brainstormed some ideas, sit down and free-write for 30 minutes or so without stopping. Try to sketch out the ending from start to finish, but don't worry about getting the sentences just right and correcting spelling just yet. Focus on getting your ideas in order for now.You may find it helpful to set a timer. Once your time is up, take a break and then come back to what you've written.  Find a quiet, low-distraction place to write so that you can focus on your writing.  Try to write for the full 30 minutes without stopping to self-edit. What you produce will probably be messy, but it's useful to get your ideas out all at once without breaking your writing flow.  Make sure your ideas are consistent with the rest of what you've written; for example, a happily-ever-after ending might work for a romance story but perhaps not for a horror story.  Make sure your chosen ending tells your readers what they want to know. Don't leave any loose threads hanging; for example, if one of your characters was about to have surgery in the middle of the story, your readers will probably want to know what happened to her., As writer Kurt Vonnegut advised, 'Use the time of a total stranger in such a way that he or she will not feel the time was wasted.'Endings such as 'it was all a dream' or 'they were dead all along' are usually a bad idea, as they almost never resolve conflict or provide a logical conclusion, and this can make your reader feel like they were tricked.Avoid the deus ex machina (literally, 'god in the machine') ending, where something happens to occur in the nick of time to help a character overcome a difficult obstacle: for example, a detective in a suspense story only solves the mystery because he gets a call from a mysterious person who has all the answers. , Try not to 'change the rules' on your reader. So, for example, if your heroine has never wanted to get married and she changes her mind at the end of your story, make sure that her reasons for that decision are shown throughout the story, rather than just having it suddenly happen.  For example: 'Millie walked to the closet. She listened to the scratching within and tried to overcome her fear. Suddenly she grabbed the handle and opened the door. A little mouse ran out of the closet, and she laughed.' This way you know exactly what happens; you will come back and polish the language in Part 4.  Keep an eye on length. A good ending will be proportionate to the rest of the story. , Focus on concrete and sensory details. In the above example, you might describe what the scratching sounded like, and what Millie imagined could be within the closet that stirred her fear.  Make sure you've provided enough information about characters' thoughts, feelings, and reactions. In the above example, the ending might reveal that Millie was really just afraid of fear itself, and seeing the mouse made her realize her own silliness.  Make sure you're consistent throughout; you don't want a story where one part is shallowly described while the rest of the story is described in even the most minute details.  Here is where you can make all the final tweaks and changes to make your story read smoothly. Proofread carefully, make sure all your grammar is correct, and polish up any unclear or awkward spots in your language.  Because you've spent so much time and effort writing the story, you may have a very different perspective of it than other readers. Having a friend read your story can help you discover if there are any places that seem confusing or out of place to readers. You may also find out that your friend thinks it's amazing just as it is!  ","reread what you have written of the story so far. consider what type of story you've written. create an outline of your story. brainstorm possible ideas. examine what you've produced. free-write. choose your favorite ideas from your brainstorming and free-writing. compare your potential ending with the story outline you wrote in part 1. respect your reader. ensure that your ending follows the internal logic you've established in the story. write out the final events in concise sentences. add descriptive language to the passage you just wrote. re-read the ending. re-read the story from beginning to end. perform a 'global edit' of your entire story. share your story with a friend!

"This is described in method one. If the ceiling is flat, by calculating the floor area, you now have your ceiling area as well. For rectangular and square rooms with flat ceilings, the area of the floor is the same as the ceiling’s area.If you have any extra parts of the ceiling that stick out or cave in, continue on to step two.  This step only applies to ceilings that are not flat. Many ceilings also have alcoves and window bays that stick out; measure the width and depth of any alcoves or window bays.Record all measurements.  A ceiling that slopes or has recesses or variation of any kind will have a larger surface area than the floor, so keep that in mind when buying materials (i.e. buy a little extra).  Ceilings can be difficult to reach. If you are measuring a ceiling, ask a friend for assistance.  You will probably need a ladder to reach the ceiling for measurement.  Add all additional measurements to the number calculated in step one. Write the total down.  If you don’t have skylights on the ceiling, skip this step. Ceilings sometimes have skylights, and the area of these must be subtracted from the total ceiling area calculated in step three. Measure the length and width of a skylight to get its area. Then, multiple the length and the width. Now, you have the area of the skylight.  Subtract the number calculated in step four from the total area of the ceiling. The result of this calculation is the square footage of your ceiling.

"Most states have adopted the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) Producer Licensing Model Act, which requires brokers and consultants to gain a license.  States such as Illinois, Rhode Island, Colorado, Georgia, Kansas and Indiana have additional requirements before consultants are able to sell insurance, including being contracted with an agency.  Some states require license applicants to be sponsored by an employer.  Check your state’s Department of Insurance website for specific information on licensing requirements, training essentials and examination locations.  Some states require that you complete prelicensing education before taking the exam.;  , While a college degree isn’t required in most states, it’s recommended to have an educational background or degree in business law, accounting, marketing, economics, mathematics or computer programming.

"When your teacher assigns reading from a textbook or website, take time to read it before you come to class. If you don’t have time to read it well, it’s a good idea to scan it so that you have an idea what it’s about.Even if you don’t know exactly what the professor will talk about during the class, you can at least know the general discussion that’s likely to take place.  Many teachers will go over the same material you were assigned as the discussion in class. This means if you’ve read the assignment, you’ll be prepared to answer questions and engage in discussion.  It’s likely that your grade will be based partially on your ability to participate in class. This means that even if you are a quiet introvert, it will be important to find ways to participate in the overall class activity.Rephrase what other people are saying to make sure that you’ve understood their meaning.  Ask questions when you don’t understand what’s being said.  When someone asks a question to which you know the answer, raise your hand to reply.  If you’re working within a small group, be an active listener. Pay attention to other students, and share your thoughts with them without dominating or demanding that they always do what you want.  If your instructor makes materials available online, or recommends certain videos or websites, take advantage of these resources when you prepare for your labs. Many teachers provide online notes, review sheets, or other information for their students’ review.  Always read these notes prior to class. Bring them to class with you when you come, and refer to them during class discussions.  If your teacher uses a particular image multiple times, try to get a copy of that image and label it so that you can better understand it.  Science classes often have demonstrations done by the teacher or other students which you’re expected to be able to replicate. If you’re going to do well in science, it’s a good idea to pay close attention to any demonstration that’s done in class.Make sure your view of the demonstration isn’t blocked by someone else. Adjust your seating if you can, in order to see. If you need to stand up or move to another seat, ask your teacher for permission.  Sometimes demonstrations can provoke laughter or excitement. Be careful not to get carried away in the thrill of a good demonstration.  When you take a science test, you’ll want to make sure you’ve correctly interpreted each problem before solving it.

"If you want to pose like a model, do not look directly into the camera. When posing as a model, you'll rarely be striking a pose where your head is pointed directly at the camera. You'll usually have your face turned away slightly. Therefore, it can look unnatural to have your eyes pointed at the camera.It's a good rule of thumb to follow your nose with your eyes. Look straight out over your nose. This will make your gaze look natural.Many people feel they look somewhat bug-eyed when gazing directly at the camera, especially if their head is turned to the side. You also may feel more self conscious when staring at the camera, which can affect your expression in subtle, unconscious ways.;  , If you raise your chin forward slightly, and then tip it downward, this elongates your neck and makes your jawline more pronounced. This can be a slimming look that highlights your facial features.  However, if you're posing from a side profile, this method can make you look like a turtle poking its head out of its shell. Hold your head in a more natural position for side profile shots., If you don't plan on smiling in a photo, open your mouth slightly. This is a small change, but one that can completely alter the feel of a photograph. If your mouth is closed, your jawline can clench. The expression can also look bored and neutral. Opening your mouth gives the picture an intimate, inviting feel.You do not need to open your mouth too much. This can look forced or unnatural. Just open your mouth slightly, parting your lips by less than a centimeter. The effect will be subtle, but can change the tone of a photo drastically.  If you choose to smile for a picture instead, go for a natural smile. Try to think of a happy moment or funny memory to try and provoke a smile.  It's important you look as slim and stretched out as possible in a model photograph. Therefore, try to elongate your neck when the picture is being taken. Depending on the angle, your neck can easily look smaller and shorter than normal on camera. Stretching your neck outward can prevent this problem.Before the picture is taken, raise your head upward. You may even want to turn your face up slightly.  If you're looking to the side in a picture, try looking up a little. This can stretch your neck out, creating a slimming appearance.  ","look away from the camera. keep your chin forward and down. try an open mouthed look. elongate your neck. "
"Kids learn how to play by themselves when they examine how toys work. You can teach a child with autism how to play independently by teaching them basic play skills. Start small, with one-step toy manipulation. For example, teach the kid how to bang a toy hammer or drum or brush a doll's hair. Once they've learned basic play, you can teach two-step toy manipulation, like:'Feeding' the doll or putting it to bed  Pressing buttons on a phone or musical toy  Placing a spoon into a bowl and stirring with the spoon  , Children with autism might feel overwhelmed if they're immediately exposed to other kids during play time. Other kids can be unpredictable which can make it harder to teach play skills. Start by playing next to the kid with autism. For example, get out a couple of coloring books and sets of crayons. Begin coloring and the child with autism can begin coloring when they feel comfortable.Follow the kid's lead when it comes to playing. Some kids with autism might like having someone sit near them as they play. You may be able to directly play games or engage in cooperative play.  You should also model a playful expression. Sing, laugh, smile, clap, and make funny voices when teaching play skills.  Once the child with autism has become comfortable playing around adults, expose them to a play group or other kids in a playful space. This will let the kid with autism become familiar with other kids. Try to choose kids who will cooperate and play easily. If the child with autism has motor delays, try to get them to play with slightly younger kids. This way, they'll easily be able to physically interact when they play.Set out motivating toys like balls, blocks, beads or puzzles for the kids to interact with.  If the child with autism show signs that they don't want to play near the kids (showing signs of aggression like hitting or biting), don't force the play time. Work on letting the child become more comfortable by playing around adults.  While you can encourage a child with autism to play by instructing them, it's better to use small physical prompts. For example, instead of saying, 'Put the puzzle together,' show the child how the pieces connect. The kid can continue putting together the puzzle on their own. Cut back on the number of cues or prompts you use to get the child to play.Limit the number of verbal prompts you give. This will prevent the child from relying on it and will help them play more independently.  Kids with autism have different preferences when it comes to personal space. If the kids are far apart when they play, you might need to scoot them a little closer together. As you do this, you should encourage the kids. For example, say, 'Good job playing together!' and give them a reward (like a sticker or treat).Consider setting out small squares of carpet or place mats with activities to encourage the kids to play near each other.  Pay attention to how both kids are interacting. If one is struggling with the play time, you may need to move them apart a little and offer more encouragement.  ","teach solitary play skills. play next to the kid. let kids play next to each other. give physical cues to play. monitor and encourage the kids. "
"Besides all the other health benefits of drinking water, it will also help keep your metabolism up. When the body gets dehydrated, metabolism slows down. This means you won't burn as many calories, making it harder for you to lose the weight you want to., While protein is important for building muscles, it also helps keep your metabolism high. This is because the body burns a lot of calories digesting it, so your metabolic rate will stay high if protein is a normal part of your diet.Good sources of protein are chicken, fish like salmon and sardines, eggs, tofu, low-fat milk, low-fat cottage cheese, nuts, and beans.  Heart disease is the number one killer of men in the United States, and diets high in saturated fats and cholesterol are a chief contributor to heart disease. Good fats, like mono- and polyunsaturated fats, lower cholesterol and decrease your risk of heart disease.Sources of good fats include oily fish like salmon and sardines, olive oil, avocados, and nuts.  Even when you're eating good fats, make sure no more than 25-35% of your overall calories come from fat. Any more will lead to weight gain.  Iron deficiency will slow down your metabolism, so you'll want to get plenty of this nutrient in your diet. Some good sources of iron are shellfish. red meat, lentils, beans, and spinach., Carbohydrates are important for a diet geared towards building muscle. Without carbs, your body will burn protein for energy, which means that the protein won't go towards building your muscles. There are two kinds of carbs, however. Complex carbohydrates take longer for your body to digest than simple carbs. As a result, your body's metabolic rate will remain high if you eat these foods.Good sources of complex carbs include whole grain products, starchy vegetables, green leafy vegetables, and beans., Spicy foods like chili peppers give your metabolism a short boost right after eating. It doesn't last very long, but eating spices regularly can have a sustained effect on your metabolism. Try adding a scoop or two of chili powder to your meals to add flavor and give your metabolism a boost., Although men usually love a good steak, red meat is not the best choice for your health.Satisfy your meat craving with lean meat like poultry, and keep red meat down to 3 servings per week.  You don't need to cut out red meat entirely. Extra lean cuts of beef and pork will provide much less fat and cholesterol, which is good for your waistline and overall health.The USDA considers an extra lean cut of meat as follows: for every 100 grams of meat, there are no more than 5 grams of total fat, 2 grams of saturated fat, and 95 milligrams of cholesterol., It's very important to keep track of your calories to avoid overeating. Make sure to read all food labels and write down everything you eat. This will help you keep your eating under control by showing you where you stand in relation to your daily maximum. Keep your count low by swapping high-calorie, low-nutrition items for nutrient-dense, low-calorie foods and snacks.Also check for apps that will help you track your calories. There are several of these that will give you an accurate measure of what you've consumed., Some people think that eating very few calories every day will help them lose weight. While you'll probably see some weight loss from this, it is overall counterproductive. First of all, it slows down your metabolism, so the calories you do eat stay around longer. Second, you'll probably lose muscle as well, which means your body won't burn as many calories. If you want to lose weight, crash dieting is not the way to do it.  ","stay well hydrated. eat plenty of protein. eat good fats. include iron in your diet. eat complex carbohydrates. add spices to your meals. eat lean meats. count your calories. avoid crash dieting.

"Shoe store salespeople will talk to you about ankle pronation, impact pattern, and plantar shape — i.e. the imprint of the bottom of your foot — but recent studies indicate that to prevent injury, you are best off simply picking a shoe that you find comfortable. It turns out that people are very good at intuitively picking shoes that will work best for their style of movement.One exception to the “pick shoes by comfort' rule is if you have flat feet. In this case, you will probably need special shoe inserts and arch supports.Save high heels for special occasions. Wearing them too frequently can lead to chronic knee pain., Particularly if you run or walk a lot, it is important to replace your shoes before the soles get too compressed. If you begin to experience sore arches, shin pain, or achy knees, then it’s time to replace your shoes. It’s better, however, to replace them before pain appears.Keep a log of how far you walk or run each day. Replace your shoes when you have covered between 400 and 600 miles.  The specific distance will depend on your weight and running style. Heavier runners and runners with longer strides will need to replace their shoes sooner.If the bottom of your shoes becomes worn down and smooth, replace them.  Braces provide added support to the knee ligaments. Particularly if you are playing a collision sport (football, lacrosse, hockey, rugby), knee braces have been shown to reduce the risk of knee injury.Players of contact sports (basketball, soccer) and sports that requires rapid changes of direction (tennis) may also benefit, as many people engaged in activities that pose a significant risk of knee injury, such as skiing. Talk to your regular doctor, a sports medicine doctor, or an orthopedist about the right brace for you.  Prophylactic — For athletes in contact sports. These braces, designed to protect ligaments, attach above and below the knee, with one or two hinged metal bars connecting the sides of the brace.Functional — For athletes in contact sports. These braces protect knee ligaments in a fashion similar to prophylactic braces, with a metal “shell” that is hinged on both sides of the knee.Patellofemoral (sleeve) — For people suffering from knee pain or athletes looking for some knee stabilization. A brace made of elastic material – usually neoprene – that is designed to hold the patella in the proper position and thus reduce chronic knee pain. These braces offer some knee stabilization, but will do little to prevent ligament damage.  ","get shoes that are comfortable and have plenty of cushioning. replace your shoes regularly. wear knee braces to reduce the risk of injury during sports or while performing dangerous activities. "

"People often hold a lot of tension in this area of their body, and when you don't have time to do a full massage, focusing on the neck and shoulders can provide instant relaxation. To massage the neck and shoulders, use the following technique:  Use your fingers to grasp the side of the neck and gently press on the muscles and tendons. Knead with your thumb and forefingers. You can massage the head at the same time with your free hand.  Rest your fingers over the shoulders and place your thumbs on the muscles located on either side of the neck. Squeeze the shoulders and press in with your thumbs. The motion should be slow and steady.  You can also use your forearms to massage the shoulders. Rest your forearms on either shoulder and gently rock back and forth to loosen the shoulder muscles.  Work down from the shoulders on either side of the back, rubbing the muscles as you go. When you get to the lower back area, knead the tight muscles there with your hands and thumbs. People who stand or sit for hours every day often develop pain in this area, so you might want to spend extra time loosening the muscles.  Remember not to exert pressure on the spine and other back bones. Focus on the muscles to either side of the spine.  Go deeper by kneeling beside the person and placing the heel of your hand on the lower back muscle on the opposite side, with your fingers pointing away from the body. Place your other hand on top of your first hand and lean into the muscle. Knead the muscle this way for a few minutes, then switch to the other side.  Use both hands to form a circle around the upper arm. Knead the arm muscles with your palms and fingers, working your way down to the wrists. Repeat with the opposite arm, then work on the legs, starting from the thighs and kneading the muscles until you reach the ankles.  Have the person you're massaging turn over so that his or her face and torso are now facing up. Massage each hand between your thumb and forefinger, taking care to work the muscles in the palms, thumbs, and each individual finger. Do the same with the feet, making sure not to press too hard on the bones.  Use gentle, even strokes on the feet. Try not to tickle the person, since that could break his or her state of relaxation.  Bend the hands and feet back and forth to stretch the muscles as you massage them.  Kneel behind the person you're massaging and use your fingers to rub his or her temples in circles. Gently rub the forehead and sinus area. Place your fingers on the person's scalp and massage it using the same motion you'd use to shampoo your hair.  ","start with the neck and shoulders. rub the back. work on the arms and legs. massage the hands and feet. end with the face and head. "
"Kindling tends to be the material used to let larger wood really catch, while tinder is small shavings or shreds of material that will burn hot quickly and starts the kindling burning. Kindling is larger than tinder. Examples of tinder include dry grass, dry bark and down from birds. Once the tinder is burning, you can slowly add the kindling, unless you've already arranged it in a style such as a lean-to or tip over the tinder (see below for links to building the fire). However, there is a fine line between what can be used as tinder and what can be used as kindling––sometimes certain material can be used for both purposes. Some ideas for tinder (some of which might also be useful as kindling) include:  Use lint. Pack a toilet paper roll with dryer lint. When you're ready for a fire, pile wood around the lint roll. Light the center of the cardboard roll (exterior) and it'll catch fire and burn outwards, catching on the piled wood as it burns. The beauty of this is that it's making use of items around the house and it doesn't weigh much in your pack. Also note that if you have several of these, they can serve as kindling as well as tinder.  Use pine needles. Use pine needles or pinecones to start a fire. Select only dry needles, not green ones, as these won't take as easily. Pile onto the fire in little lots rather than everywhere or it risks smothering the flame.  Save and dry small pieces of tree bark. Bark catches fire quickly and will maintain embers for a long time.  Use dry debris. Use dry debris from your yard, such as twigs, leaves, and moss to start a fire. Ensure that there isn't too much soil in what you've gathered, as it can prevent fire from lighting.;  , Normally you'd look for dry wood, such as tree limbs, tree twigs and branches, or split wood if at an organized campsite. However, this isn't always possible, so the following ideas are presented to help you in a pinch.  If you have a bag of potato chips handy, they can function as a fire-starter due to the fat content of the chips. Light a chip with a lighter or a match and it will burn for approximately 3 minutes. Add the lit chip to a pile of chips on the campfire you've set up (see below for making a fire). While the chip kindling is burning, place light, dry wood on top to catch alight over the burning chips.  Roll five dry newspapers into a tight tube, tie the tube into a knot, and light the knot on fire. The tight paper will burn slowly, allowing more time for the wood to catch fire.  Tying the paper into a knot will prevent the layers from moving around when lit.  Pine cones are quick to catch fire over tinder (such as pine needles). As well as being suitable kindling, they give off a great aroma.  Once you've assembled the tinder and kindling, you'll need to make a decision as to how to build the fire. There are quite a few ways to build a fire, each having its own utility dependent on where you are, the temperature and weather and the terrain, etc. Here are some articles to follow on to, which will explain how to make a fire successfully:  How to build a campfire  How to start a fire with sticks or How to start a fire with a magnifying glass  How to make a fire to survive.  Keep the fire well stoked by adding new fuel regularly throughout the time of the fire's use.  If the fire goes out, sometimes you can restart it simply be shifting around the coals and throwing on some more kindling to catch fire to the existing hot logs on the campfire.  Wet wood can be dried out next to a fire; sometimes you'll have no choice.  ","find tinder. find a substitute for kindling. use your favorite potato chips as a fire starter. use newspaper. use pine cones. make the fire. enjoy a night under the stars next to the warmth of your new fire.

"If you still have the instructions manual, read it before cleaning your coffee maker. Most coffee makers can safely be cleaned with a vinegar/water mixture, but it's always a good idea to check first.If you don't have the instructions manual, try looking up your model online. You may be able to find an instructions manual on the Internet.  Many people keep the reservoir lid closed. However, it's a good idea to leave it open when not in use. This will help dry out the machine, preventing mold and bacteria from growing in a moist environment., The brew basket is very susceptible to mold as it gets wet during the brewing process.

"In this method, you insert a long, flat knife or similar object directly into the CD player. Knives made from metal conduct electricity, so, if you have an object made from wood or plastic that will work (like, for instance, a popsicle stick), use it. If not, be sure to disconnect all power supplies from the CD player and make sure any electrical charge has been removed. Turn the car and the CD player off and disconnect the negative terminal of your car's battery.  Note: As with other methods described in this article, this method carries the risk of damage to the stuck CD or the CD player itself. If you don't want to put your property at risk, take your car to a trained automotive professional.  Use a strong tape like Gorilla tape for best results. Putty knives are typically tapered so that if you wrap the tape tight enough, it will not slide off the end. If you're using another object, like a popsicle stick, which doesn't taper, you may need to stick the tape to the object, wrap it around several times, then put a twist in the tape and wrap it around several more times to make sure the tape is adequately secured to the object.  Because your knife (or stick, etc.) is now covered with sticky tape, it can be difficult to insert it into the CD player. To make this process easier, use paper to make one side of your knife smooth. Stick a small piece of printer or construction paper onto your knife. Trim the paper with scissors so that it matches the size and shape of the knife.  Delicately wiggle your knife to feel for the top of the CD. Press down gently to get the tape to stick to the CD. When you feel that your knife is stuck to the CD, gently try to lift and remove the CD.

"If you and your crush are both adults and part of the professional world, you can indirectly ask for a phone number by asking for a business card.  The downside of this option is that you may end up getting a business phone number instead of a private phone number. Make sure that one of the phone number on the card is marked as a cell phone before calling for personal reasons.  Asking another person to interfere works well if the third person is a mutual friend with both of you. Ideally, this mutual friend will already have your crush's number. If not, he may be more comfortable asking for it than you are.Your mutual friend may catch onto your motives, so choose who you ask carefully. If you are not ready to have word get back to your crush about how you feel, make sure that the friend you ask can keep a secret.  Nowadays, you can find out a lot about a person just by snooping online for a bit. The easiest way to find someone's phone number online is to check that person's Facebook page. If the two of you are friends, there is a decent chance that your crush's phone number will be visible to you.  While there are no free, reliable services that allow you to find anyone's cell phone number, you can simply check the phone book for a home phone number. This might be better than nothing.  This tactic will only work if your crush has a landline and if that number is publicly listed.  Note that if your crush is underage or otherwise lives with her parents you will need to know the names of your crush's parents.  When you do call, make sure that your reason for doing so sounds justifiably urgent. Acknowledge that you got the number from a third party and explain why you needed it.  For instance, you could call to ask a question about a shared assignment and explain that you got the number from a friend in another class. You could also text an invitation to a group event and mention who passed the number along to you.  You could also just tell her that you wanted to call her to ask her out.

"Toothpaste works for many of the same reason Vick's Vapor Rub works. It contains menthol as a primary ingredient, which is very effective at reducing symptoms of a mosquito bite.Dab a small amount of toothpaste to the infected area and repeat as long as symptoms persist.  Make sure you are not allergic to any ingredients in the brand of toothpaste you use, paying particularly close attention to potential mint allergies. If you are allergic, applying toothpaste can make symptoms worse.  Alcohol evaporates on the skin, a process that causes cooling. This reduces itch and also disinfects the bite. Grab items that list rubbing alcohol as a primary ingredient and apply them to the bite.  Most brands of mouthwash have a high concentration of alcohol.  If you do not use mouth wash, many hand sanitizers or hand soaps are alcohol-heavy.  ","try toothpaste. go for items with high alcohol concentrations. "
"Despite the commonly held belief that people need to vent their anger to help alleviate its damaging effects, research indicates that this method is counterproductive and can actually increase anger. However, exercise is very effective at relieving symptoms of depression and anxiety.The benefits of exercise for regulating anger are debated. Some studies suggest that because vigorous exercise actually increases physiological arousal, it may make feelings of anger worse.However, slow exercises such as yoga and tai chi may help you relax and calm down.Studies have also shown that over the course of several weeks, exercise can increase feelings of emotional well-being and calm, especially in people who are experiencing symptoms of depressed mood.Exercise is unlikely to help you in the moment, but it's good for your heart and also appears to help your emotional health in the long run.  Join a community league. If you like to play team sports, it could be helpful to join an adult basketball, softball, or soccer league. You'll get regular exercise, you'll get in better physical shape, and you'll make some friends that will likely become part of your social support system.  Try going for a relaxing walk when you feel overwhelmed. Allow yourself to be quiet with yourself. Drink in the natural beauty that surrounds you, focusing on noticing the small beautiful details that you usually miss. Breathe deeply and evenly. This will get you exercise and help you relax.  Deep-breathing exercises, listening to calming music, and progressive muscle relaxation have all been shown to be effective for slowing heart rates and decreasing anxiety. Each technique takes some practice to master, but those who learn to use them often find them to be highly effective. Learn how to breathe. Practice breathing deeply from your diaphragm. Breathing shallowly from your chest won't help. Instead, imagine your breath coming up from your gut. If you can master this technique, you'll find it much easier to relax yourself.  The process is simple. Just sit straight in a chair with your feet flat on the floor and your eyes closed. Think of a calming phrase, such as “I feel at peace' or 'Take it easy' and say it or think it to yourself over and over, syncing your words with your breathing. Before you know it, your negative thoughts will drift away and you’ll feel more relaxed.(Note: if you are a spiritual or religious person, prayer could be a useful substitute for meditation.) Don't give up too soon. Meditation can be difficult, especially at first, because it takes some patience to see any results. At first, you may even feel a bit more anxious or frustrated, just because you want it to work more quickly. Take your time, and you'll reap the rewards.  Crying is viewed as a sign of weakness in some cultures, particularly for men.

"If you find out someone has been practicing mind games on you, or someone you know, and has done it well, figure out what made that person so successful. Study their mannerisms and words to figure out their technique.  Be sure to study the person you are trying to play a mind game with, so that you know how that person thinks. This will allow you to take the best approach for getting this person to take part in your game.  A lot of people are easily responsive to emotional situations and hardships. For sympathetic and empathetic people, you will want to play to their emotions by having them feel bad for you. This will lead them into helping you however you say you need it., This tactic requires you to gain the sympathy of the other person. You need to act like you are a perfect, moral person who keeps being victimized by the evils of the world, and you just don't know why. This will make someone feel obligated to give in to any requests you may have.  Simply pretend to be ignorant, and say, “I just don’t know what I keep doing wrong. Why do bad things keep happening to me?' Pretend like you are genuinely confused as to why things never work out for you.  When you know that someone is sensitive to guilt, be sure to play on that weakness. Guilt can weigh very heavy on a lot of people, and they will do their best to avoid that feeling. When you go to ask for a favor that someone may not want to do, you can attempt to guilt trip that person into doing it. Here are some things you can say if someone turns you down:  'I knew you would let me down.'  'I am not surprised that you won't do it, I am used to it.', If you find someone who goes by fact, and does not believe in something unless there is evidence to back it up, then you need more than emotions to mess with this person. Figure out a way to back up what you say with reason or logical benefits to be more convincing.For example, if you want someone to eat more healthy, explain how unhealthy food leads to health problems, and that vegetables can add years to your life. This may convince someone to healthier foods.  ","study other manipulators. practice reading people. watch for emotionally driven people. play the victim. look for guilt-ridden people. be aware of logically minded people. "

"Everyone feels great about themselves sometimes and not so great about themselves at other times. Some research indicates that people with bipolar disorder may experience greater fluctuations in self-esteem than other people do.While you want to do things to boost your self-esteem and maintain your self-confidence, you also want to make sure you aren’t going too far.  Keep a list of your positive qualities in a journal. Think about things you are good at, coping strategies you’ve developed, personality traits, and more.  Add to it and review it frequently. If your entries seem a bit outrageous (for example, if you write “I’m the best pianist ever”) it may be signs of a manic episode.  When you are managing bipolar disorder you may find that you put yourself down or think negative things about yourself. This may lead to a cycle of negativity. Instead, keep a positive focus by thinking encouraging thoughts and talking kindly to yourself.  For example, instead of saying to yourself, “I’m so weird for having bipolar disorder” you might think, “My bipolar gives me a unique perspective on life.”  Or, for instance, you might say to yourself, “Having bipolar disorder makes me more compassionate” instead of thinking, “bipolar disorder makes me too emotional.”  , When you have bipolar disorder it may seem that it is taking over your life. You may feel like all you do is take medication, go to meetings, attend therapy, etc. One way that you can maintain a positive outlook is to focus on other things in life as well.Focus on the small things that make you smile as well as the large ones.  For example, instead of focusing on whether people at the party you’re attending can tell you have bipolar disorder, focus on enjoying yourself.  Or, for instance, focus on seeing the beauty in your community as you walk to school rather than focusing on how your bipolar impacts your life.  Start scheduling your calendar with things and activities that are important to you and that you will look forward to. For instance, schedule some trips for yourself and/or your family, such as holiday trips, birthday outings, or other special events.  Not only will you feel the excitement of anticipation while counting the days to your special events and trips, but using your calendar will also help you to prioritize and organize your work and self-care time so you don’t neglect yourself.  Even people that aren’t battling bipolar disorder may attend therapy to help them develop and maintain a positive focus. If therapy isn’t already a part of your treatment plan, then consider trying it. Therapy can help you handle other life issues, provide you with additional coping strategies, and help you manage your bipolar disorder.  Ask your healthcare or mental health professional which form of therapy might work best for you. You might say, “I really want to focus on remaining positive. Is there a type of therapy that can help me?”  If you are already attending therapy, ask your therapist if you can work on maintaining a positive focus. For instance, you could say, “Could we address ways for me to stay positive?”  ","stabilize your self-esteem. use positive self-talk. focus on other things. consider therapy. "
"If you want to file bankruptcy, you must have documentation of your expenses, debts, and income and assets to provide to the bankruptcy court.  To start, you must have records of all major financial transactions you've made in the last two years as well as records of all secured and unsecured debts in the same time period.You also must have information on any assets you have and their value, as well as your income. Compile property documents such as deeds or car titles., Under Chapter 7 bankruptcy, you can discharge most of your debts, while Chapter 13 requires you to repay your creditors through a court-ordered repayment plan.You must meet a means test to qualify for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. if you're unemployed or have extremely low income and few assets, you probably qualify for Chapter 7.You also may be ineligible to file Chapter 13 bankruptcy if your debts exceed a certain amount, or if you don't have sufficient disposable income., Your home and certain personal property such as clothing and furniture may be exempt from bankruptcy under federal or state law.Some states require you to use the state exemptions, while others allow you to choose either the federal or state system. If you're allowed to choose, you can only use one set of exemptions – you can't use some exemptions from the state list and others from the federal list.The exemptions you can claim also depend on the type of bankruptcy you're filing. Since Chapter 7 bankruptcy is a liquidation bankruptcy, any assets you have that aren't exempt will be sold to pay off your debts. However, if something is exempt then you can keep it.For example, if you own a house worth $20,000 and your state has a homestead exemption of $25,000, you can keep your house. However, if your house is worth $100,000, you may be forced to sell it to pay off your debts.If you're filing Chapter 13 bankruptcy, you generally can keep all of your assets, but the value of the property you keep will determine the amount of your monthly payments., Before you decide to file for bankruptcy, try to schedule a consultation with between one and three bankruptcy attorneys to get a legal opinion on your case.  Even if you think you can't afford attorney's fees, keep in mind hiring an attorney actually could save you money. For example, f you make a mistake, it could result in having your bankruptcy petition dismissed.Additionally, an attorney may be able to get the court to discharge more of your debts or allow you to keep more of your property. That savings may help offset the cost of hiring the attorney.If you do decide to file on your own, check with the clerk of your nearest bankruptcy court to find out if there are any free workshops or clinics you can attend to learn more about the bankruptcy process., Once you file a bankruptcy petition, all collection activities against you must cease.When you fill out your petition, you must enter information about yourself and all of your debts, including the nature of those debts and whether they are secured or unsecured. You also will have to estimate the number of creditors you have as well as your total debts and your total assets.You must pay a filing fee of $335 if you're filing Chapter 7 and $310 if you're filing Chapter 13. If you cannot afford the filing fees, you may be able to apply for a fee waiver or pay in installments.If a collection agency has sued you or already has a judgment against you and has filed for a wage garnishment, you can prevent the garnishment by filing for bankruptcy.

"If you don’t have yarn available, you can use any thick cotton string. At the location of where you would like the bottle to break, wrap a piece of yarn around the bottle 3-5 times. Tie the ends together and cut off any excess string.  Slide the yarn off the end of the bottle, and place it in a small dish or lid. Pour a bit of nail polish remover or straight-up acetone over the yarn until it is completely soaked. You can pour the excess acetone back into the bottle afterwards.  Take the yarn and replace it back on the bottle in the exact location you want it to break. Try to make sure that the loops of yarn are placed close together and are tight so that you get a level, clean break.  Use a match or a lighter to catch the yarn (on the bottle) on fire. Rotate the bottle slowly so that the yarn burns at a consistent speed around the entire bottle.  Have your sink or a pot filled with cold water - you can add ice as well if you would like. Wait until the fire on the yarn has burnt out, and then stick the end of the bottle with the yarn directly into the water. The bottle should break cleanly off where the yarn was wrapped around it.  Use a rough sandpaper to smooth down the jagged edges on the broken section of the bottle. When you have removed any sharp corners, switch to a fine grit sandpaper to give the bottle a smooth, soft finish. You’re done!  ","wrap your yarn. soak the yarn in acetone. wrap the bottle again. light the yarn on fire. dunk the bottle in cold water. sand the edges. "
"You might feel angry at whoever diagnosed you or overwhelmed with dealing with your new diagnosis. Instead of feeling stressed or anxious or letting your thoughts get the best of you, practice self-care for several days.Focus on taking care of yourself and not on jumping to conclusions about your diagnosis or treatment.  Go for a walk, talk a bath, read a book, meditate, or do something that feels calming and enjoyable to you. Check out How to Practice Self Care for more tips.  Avoid turning to drugs or alcohol as a way to cope with your feelings.;  , You may feel like your sense of identity has changed and you don’t know what to do with yourself. Calm yourself by saying, “I am okay the way I am. I am not bad, and nothing bad is happening to me this moment.”Nothing bad is happening to you, and nothing has truly changed beyond your awareness.  Remember that having a diagnosis can be a good thing. It allows you to find useful treatments, and some people may find that it gives them closure.  Borderline personality disorder is just a name. It does not define who you are or what you are worth.  You are still the same person who you were before. Now you just have one more piece of information about yourself.  It’s normal to have various emotions after receiving a mental health diagnosis. You may feel relief, shock, denial, shame, confusion, or powerless.Don’t be ashamed of how you feel, but let yourself feel these emotions as completely valid and okay. Recognize that it’s normal to have many emotions about a diagnosis and allow yourself to feel them as they occur.  You may fear having to tell people or facing social stigma of mental illness or personality disorders. Don’t get too far ahead into the details now, and instead, focus on what you feel and how you feel it.  If you feel sad, note where in your body you feel that sadness and express it however you see fit. If you want to cry, journal, or just listen to your feelings, that’s okay.  Borderline personality disorder is not a disease or a marker of a “bad” person. It’s simply a category of similar symptoms from people who tend to have a trauma history. Yes, knowing that many people with BPD have a trauma history can help you cope with feelings of shame and enable you to realize that this diagnosis is not your fault.Learn what symptoms are typical and how BPD affects those who have it.  Some people, media sources, and movies see those with BPD as scary, reckless, and as the most extreme cases. Not everyone with BPD has the most extreme case, and symptoms may vary from one person to another. If you read things on the internet or talk to people who make sweeping generalizations about people with BPD, take a step back or do not associate with them.Remind yourself that you are not borderline, but that you have a diagnosis of BPD, and that it doesn’t have to define you.  Remember that you are still a unique person with unique skills, characteristics, and problems. A diagnosis can't change who you are.  A diagnosis simply puts a name to your symptoms. While it might seem scary, the symptoms would exist with or without a diagnosis. Once you have a diagnosis, however, you can take steps towards healing.  Therapy is the main treatment used for borderline personality disorder. Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) was specifically designed to treat borderline personality disorder and includes learning skills to manage your emotions more effectively.DBT uses four modules (mindfulness, distress tolerance, emotional regulation, and interpersonal effectiveness) to target specific characteristics of borderline personality disorder.DBT often has you working with an individual therapist as well as in group therapy. Group therapy can be very effective, so don't be afraid to try it out., If DBT doesn’t sound like a good fit, there are other approaches to treating BPD through therapy. Find a therapist and therapy approach that feels like a good fit.Therapies aimed to help BPD include schema therapy (which identifies unmet needs that have lead to negative patterns), Mentalization-based therapy (MBT) (which allows you to identify your thoughts and emotions and see them from a new perspective), and psychodynamic therapy (which helps you understand your emotions and interpersonal difficulties as reflected through the therapeutic relationship).When you find an approach and a therapist that seems like a fit, stay with it. Even if you go through a difficult period, try to work through the challenge. It is normal to struggle to sometimes.  If you experience acute or prolonged trauma, start treatment for the trauma right away. Some options to explore include eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR), exposure therapy, somatic experiencing (SE), and trauma-focused cognitive behavior therapy (TF-CBT). The trauma may affect your daily living, and for this reason, it’s important to address it up front.You may be able to resolve some of the emotional pain and work through deep wounds with trauma-focused therapy.  Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) often has a group therapy component. However, you may choose to attend group therapy for treatment in addition to individual treatment or to attend a support group. Being a part of a group can help you learn new skills and practice your skills in a safe environment.You can also benefit from reaching out to others with BPD and gaining insight from their experiences.  Call your local mental health clinic and community centers to see whether groups are offered for BPD.  If you feel like things are too much and you cannot take them and want an out, get help immediately. If you work with a mental health provider, contact him or her first. If you do not have a therapist, call your physician or go to the nearest emergency department. You can also call emergency services or a suicide helpline, such as 1-800-273-8255 in the USA.  Some signs of suicide include talking or thinking about killing yourself, selling your possessions, increasing alcohol or drug use, feeling like you have no purpose and are a burden to others, socially withdrawing, and acting reckless or out of control., Some people supplement therapy with medications. While there are no medications specifically designed for BPD, some symptoms can be addressed through pharmaceuticals. For example, if you suffer from mood swings, you may benefit from a mood stabilizer, and an antipsychotic can help with feelings of rage or disorganized thoughts.Talk to a psychiatrist about medication. Your psychiatrist will help you manage your symptoms through medication. Yet, be aware that you may try several prescriptions and experience side-effects before finding one that suits you.  Medications will not cure you, but they can stabilize your mood so that therapy is more effective.  Find ways to help you deal with stress and cope better. Practice relaxation methods every day to help you manage your stress. Practicing for 30 minutes each day can help stabilize your moods.You can practice coping skills when stressors arise individually as well.  Start a mindfulness practice. First start with focusing on your breathing when you are feeling distressed or anxious. Turn your thoughts and emotions to focusing on each inhale and exhale to help you enter a calm space.  For long-term methods, try engaging in a relaxation practice every day. Get into daily yoga, qigong, tai chi, and meditation. Find the one that appeals to you and do it every day.  It’s important to feel supported by the people in your life as you experience shock or any other strong emotions about your recent diagnosis. Being near people who love you and care about you can be important during this time. Surround yourself with family and close friends to support you. Talk to someone who will listen to you and be helpful during this time. Continue to use your social support throughout your treatment.  Build your social support from people who will listen to you and respect you., Especially after immediately receiving your diagnosis, you may feel out of sorts and need help from others to get back into a normal life. However, people may not know how to support you. If you have a need, be direct and kind about it. Use “I” statements to express your feelings and your needs.For example, you may say, “I don’t want advice, I just want someone to listen right now.” You can also say, “I am looking for advice and would appreciate some guidance about this.” Be honest with others about how you’re feeling and what you’re needing.  Say, “It’s hard for me to take in all the information at once, and I feel really overwhelmed. I feel like I’m shutting down and need some help. Can you help me with household needs this week?”  , If you don’t feel supported by the people in your life, consider increasing your social circle with friends who care about you and whom you care about. It can be difficult to build friendships and find closeness with others. Yet, remind yourself that it’s important to have friends that will help you and support you through difficult times.  You can also engage in activities that interest you, such as hiking, boating, or woodworking. Find groups of other people who share similar interests as you and start attending meetings or events. Having something in common gives you an instant bond.Another great way to meet new people and make friends is through volunteering. Volunteer at your local spiritual community, mentor disadvantaged children, or take dogs for a walk at your local shelter. There are plenty of ways to get involved in your local community and give back. Check out How to Volunteer for more information.

"You're going to be completing a pretty rigorous academic program for the next 15 years or so, so it's best to develop the work ethnic now. When you're used to studying and gettin' good at the book learning, you'll get less stressed out when med school rolls around.  And those good grades will get you into a better undergrad program which will, in turn, get you into a better medical school. Those good grades are what's going to get you an internship and a residency -- without them, the doors won't open for you.;  , You may think going pre-med is your only option, but it's actually quite the opposite: some schools actually encourage you not to go pre-med. As long as you get the core requirements in, they suggest doing something you enjoy. Med school is bad enough; don't make it four years longer!It's a good idea to major in biology, chemistry, physics, or even English (it's a large part of the MCAT -- just make sure your electives are science-based). The more balanced out you are, the better you'll do in the future.  If you go pre-med and change your mind (which loads of people do), you're up a creek without a paddle. That's why it's better to major in biology and the like.  If you live in the UK, take the UKCAT or BMAT. Taking this exam as early as possible will ensure that you have time to retake it if you don't do as well as you'd like. Different schools have different minimum scores for admission, so check with the schools you're considering to see if your MCAT score is high enough.  It's best to take the MCAT in your junior or early senior year. Be sure to study, study, study -- this score will determine what schools take you seriously when you apply.  Most medical schools like to see a solid background in life sciences and sturdy grades. Keep them as high as possible and try to get some experience in a research lab if you can. The more practical experience you have going in, the better. And you'll get an idea if this is indeed the path for you!  If you already graduated but didn't major in the sciences, there's still hope. Most people who've found their calling later in life just take a few classes post-baccalaureate to pad their transcripts and then apply. It is doable!  , These programs are competitive, so you may end up commuting or moving to another city to complete your doctorate. A Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine degree (D.O.) or Doctor of Medicine degree (M.D.) is required before you can move on to dermatology residency training. This program will take you about four years to finish.  The first two years will be spent in the classroom; the latter two years will be spent doing more hands-on training. You'll be working on clinical rotations, observing the pros and getting your feet wet. Finally!  , Med school is not for the faint of heart. If you can't handle not sleeping, a stressful course-load, and zero social life, it may not be the path for you. And rightfully so -- people's lives will be in your hands. Can you handle the heat?  You absolutely need to get good grades. Half-assing your way through won't cut it if you want this to be your profession. Unlike undergrad, you can't party away the night and fill in mostly Cs on your multiple choice exams and get by. This is stuff that needs to be taken very seriously.  For the med school student, June through August are not months to be drinking beer, watching baseball, and gearing up for September. You have to be permanently geared up. Take this time to take extra courses or get work. The more experience you have, the less you'll be phased in the long-run.  Heck, study abroad and help out in a grassroots medical program in a third world country. Volunteer. Do something related to what you want to do for the rest of your life. Get on a committee. Organize events. Find a mentor. Do something that sets you apart from the rest.  After around 3 years or so in med school, you'll be granted the opportunity to choose your electives -- or, in other words, what you want to focus on. It's in your fourth year (or the equivalent thereof) that you get to zero in on becoming a dermatologist.  That stands for the United States Medical Licensing Exam and Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensing Examination, respectively (so, obviously, if you're not in the U.S., don't worry about it) and each examination comes in three parts. Take this incredibly seriously as a good score is needed to obtain a residency. In fact, 1/3 of all applicants fail to get accepted into one.Step 1 is generally taken in the second year of your program; step 2 is taken during the fourth year, and the third step is taken during the first or second year of post-graduate training., In 1952, the NRMP (National Residency Matching Program) began. Luckily for you, placement rates are getting higher and higher.Think of it as going Greek. You interview with some hospitals and at the end of the day you both fill out who you want to work with. If you're both on each other's list, you got it! You want to be trained by them and they want to train you. Excellent.  You'll have a list of hospitals ranked in order of preference. You can include a combination of preliminary, transitional, categorical and advanced programs. So in the months prior (this is usually started in June or July), do your research and get to interviewing!  , Not all grads have to do a preliminary year, but dermatologists do. This is technically part of your residency, but it's viewed as just an internship (and can be done at a different hospital) and you'll be working in surgery or internal medicine (probably). But hey, you're out of school and on the right path! Super. Now it's time to prove that you've learned your stuff.  Some choose to take a transitional year (or TY). However, this is generally viewed as less academic (read: easier) and those that do it struggle when they get to their actual residency. Do a prelim year in pediatrics, general medicine, or whatever you could tolerate doing another year of!  Getting an internship and residency is primo. Like mentioned above, plenty of people don't make it. If you don't have the stuff, it won't happen -- and it definitely won't fall into your lap. This needs to be a goal of yours from the get-go.  You may be able to continue at your current school but chances are you'll end up moving to another city and starting a new teaching program for your residency. In the United States, the school must be accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) or the American Osteopathic Association (AOA) and in Canada, it must have accreditation from the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada.  The American Board of Dermatology requires that a Preliminary Registration Form be completed by you within 30 days of starting your dermatology residency. In addition, your training director must fill out the Yearly Report Form on an annual basis to attest that you're completing the program properly.  This is time well-spent learning from your mentors and finding your niche. You'll still be supervised as you're a newbie doctor, but you're a doctor nonetheless.  Though technically you're done at this juncture (apart from taking the last and final exam to get certified), some people decide to pursue a fellowship to establish a specialty. This is another spent devoted to working just in the one specific branch of dermatology that speaks to you.  You have a plethora of options -- everything from working with children to senior citizens, to skin cancer to removing tattoos. Your near decade of work in the area should give you a pretty good idea as to what you want to do!  , Passing this will give you your certification by the American Board of Dermatology or the American Osteopathic Board of Dermatology. You will then hold the title of board-certified dermatologist. Congratulations!  Check out the American Board of Dermatology's website for more information.They have links on test dates and procedures you'll need to know to complete your certification.  The regulations on licensure vary by state, so check with your local Department of Health for the requirements. After the application fee and assembling your qualifications, you should be good to go!  For now, that is. You'll need to retake (and pass) your boards every decade and take CME (continuing medical education) classes to stay up-to-date. It's all for the good will of your patients! Worth it.  Now that you're a licensed dermatologist, there are a number of work environments you could consider. It all depends on your specialty. Where do you see yourself working and with what types of people?  You could have your own private practice, or you could work in hospitals, spas, research labs, or clinics. And there's always teaching!  , Apart from being ridiculously driven to succeed, you need to be able to handle the human body in all its glory, too. You're going to see a lot of stuff you probably won't want to see, especially right after lunch.  Life is going to be full of rashes, skin aberrations, moles, blood, pus, and other unsightly things. If you don't have the stomach for it, this may not be a feasible career choice. If you don't know this going on, you'll soon find it out!  , Because of the human condition, loads of skin problems are just symptoms. It's not enough to know how the skin works -- you gotta know how the whole body works. Patients will come in with a skin rash that's actually due to problems in their digestive system. The problem might be in someone else's jurisdiction and you gotta know.  You also have to get a pretty good idea of what questions to ask. Each person's skin is different and their lifestyle, habits, and genes can all take their toll in different ways. Because of the wide variety of skin problems, you have to be able to pinpoint straight away the possible causes and narrow it down from there. Get good at questions now!  , According to the Bureau of Labor & Statistics, dermatologists are not hurting for cash. After a few years and if you're succeeding, you should be well making into the six figures and then some.The need for dermatologists is said to be on the rise. With more and more people becoming skin conscious, it seems as though this is a trend that will only continue.  Not only will this job be incredibly financially rewarding, but it will be personally rewarding, too. You'll be helping loads of people be healthier and feel better about themselves. Now that's cool.

"Taking an over-the-counter medication is one of the fastest and easiest ways to get rid of a fever. If your fever is from a viral infection, then it may be difficult to treat. Viruses live in the cells of the body and reproduce rapidly. They do not respond to antibiotics.You can, however, take medication to try to manage your body's fever response, no matter what the cause.  Try taking acetaminophen (Tylenol) or aspirin to help bring down your fever. Make sure that you follow the instructions on the package and do not exceed the recommended dosage.  Don't give aspirin to children, because it can cause Reye's syndrome if they have viral infections. Acetaminophen is a safer option. Look for 'children's' formulas, and follow dosage instructions carefully.;  , Bathing or showering in lukewarm water may also help to cool down your body faster as well.Fill the bathtub with lukewarm water or adjust your shower until the water is lukewarm. Soak in the tub or stand in the shower for 10 to 15 minutes to help cool down your body.  Do not take a freezing cold shower or add ice to the bath to bring down your fever. Just stick to lukewarm water to gently reduce your fever.  A fever can dehydrate you and this may make matters worse. Make sure that you drink plenty of water to help your body combat the fever and keep yourself well-hydrated as well.  Kids may also need to drink an electrolyte fluid, such as Pedialyte, to help replenish lost electrolytes.Ask your child's pediatrician first to see if this is necessary.  Gatorade or Powerade are also an option. You may want to cut these with water to reduce the sugar and calorie content.  Taking multivitamins will not fight the fever directly, but it will strengthen your body so it can fight.  Take a multivitamin with vitamins A, C, E, and B-complex vitamins, magnesium, calcium, zinc, and selenium.  Take one or two capsules or teaspoons of fish oil every day for the omega-3 fatty acids.  You can also try zinc or echinacea.  Probiotic supplements or foods (like yogurt with 'active cultures') will introduce more Lactobacillus acidophilus bacteria into your system and improve immune health. But if you have a severely compromised immune system, talk to your doctor before taking probiotics.  Do not take herbal supplements without consulting your doctor. Some can interact with prescription medication or medical conditions.  This, in turn, stimulates the immune system and triggers a more restful, healing state of sleep.  Soak a pair of thin cotton socks in lukewarm water, then wring them out until they're moist but not dripping.  Put them on when you're going to bed, then wear a thicker pair of dry socks over them.  Take two nights off after five to six days.  Adult bodies can handle fever pretty well, but children may suffer febrile seizures if the fever rises too high. In fact, fever is the leading cause of seizures in children between six months and five years.If the child's temperature rises over 104°F (40°), or begins to rise quickly, start cooling them off immediately. Remove his clothing. Use a sponge or washcloth to pat tepid (not cold) water all over his body to bring down his temperature.Applying ice to a fevered body can be dangerous if done incorrectly. It causes shivering, which actually raises body temperature.They may apply ice in a hospital setting, but it's best to use tepid water at home.  Call the doctor immediately if your child’s fever spikes. They will either direct you to take the child to an ER or provide detailed guidance for how to care for them at home.  Call 911 for emergency assistance if the child has a seizure.  Your doctor may administer rectal diazepam to treat febrile seizure in your child.  Sometimes a fever just has to run its course, but you can do things to make yourself more comfortable while you wait for it to go away. For example, placing wet towels on your skin won't reduce the fever, but it may help to reduce discomfort from the fever.Moisten a washcloth or hand towel with cool water and apply it to your neck or forehead.  Wear warm clothes and stay under blankets to deal with the chills from the fever. If you feel hot, then just use a light sheet and wear light, breathable clothes.  GI infections are more commonly known as the 'stomach flu.' Symptoms include diarrhea, stomach pain, nausea or vomiting, and muscle or headaches.They often also present with a low-grade fever. GI infections resolve on their own in three to seven days, so you just need to take care of yourself until yours passes. Drink at least eight to ten 8 oz. glasses of water per day, especially if you are vomiting. Watch for symptoms of dehydration in children, as this needs emergency attention. Signs include fewer wet diapers, decreased fontanelle (soft spot on the skull) size, sunken eyes, and lethargy. If you see these symptoms, call emergency services or seek immediate medical attention.  The BRAT (Bananas, Rice, Applesauce, and Toast) diet is often recommended for GI trouble, but the evidence to support it is weak. The American Academy of Pediatrics does not recommend using it for children, as it does not provide adequate nutrition.Eat reasonably, stay away from greasy, heavy, and spicy foods, and drink plenty of water.  Herbal remedies can be taken in a number of forms: powder, capsule, or tincture. Many people prefer to brew hot teas with dried herbs. The warm liquid soothes the throat while the herbs fight the fever. To brew an herbal tea, steep one teaspoon of the herb in a cup of hot water for five to ten minutes for leaves or flowers or ten to twenty minutes for roots. Talk with your doctor before consuming any herbs or natural remedies, as they may interfere with prescription medication or other medical conditions. The following herbs all improve immune function, but can have some negative side effects:Green tea may increase your anxiety levels and raise your blood pressure. You may want to avoid drinking green tea if you have diarrhea, glaucoma, or osteoporosis. Consult your doctor if you have liver disease.  Cat's claw may make autoimmune disorders or leukemia worse. It can also interfere with certain types of medications, so talk to your doctor before drinking it.  Reishi mushroom you may find this as a tincture rather than in dried form. Take 30-60 drops two to three times a day. Reishi may interact with some medicines as well, like blood thinners and blood pressure medications.  Wash your hands often with antibacterial soap. Keep your distance from uninfected people and public spaces as much as possible. Don't share glasses or utensils with anyone, and don't take it personally if your partner doesn't want to kiss you for a while!  Have children play with hard toys that can be cleaned easily in the sink with soap and water.  If someone in your household or workplace has been ill in the recent past, you may have picked it up from them. Children often spread illnesses to each other, and may catch a cold or the flu from friends at school or the playground.If you know that the other person’s illness resolved on its own, you can relax a bit. Your illness will likely also resolve with rest and plenty of water.  They may be able to use that information to diagnose you with a specific illness. For example, you may assume you have a simple cold, but after a week, your fever spikes suddenly. Odds are you have a secondary bacterial infection like an ear infection or pneumonia. Some cancers, like non-Hodgkin lymphoma, on the other hand, cause a fever at night, but none during the day.  Make sure to take your temperature multiple times every day until the fever recedes.  Night fevers may be a sign of tuberculosis or HIV/AIDS.  Make note of anything that seems out of the ordinary, even if it doesn't make you feel ill, necessarily. Unexpected weight change, for example, can point to several causes. Your other symptoms may be able to point to the organ system being affected, which will narrow the field for diagnosis.  For example, a cough suggests a lung problem like pneumonia.Burning during urination points to a kidney infection., Give your temperature log and list of symptoms to your doctor, who will try to diagnose the cause of the fever. They will do a physical examination will provide further clues about the source of the fever.The history you provided and physical exam will help the doctor narrow down the possible causes. The causes can be easily confirmed or ruled out with lab analysis or imaging.  Common tests your doctor may order include a physical examination, white blood cell count, urine analysis, blood cultures, and a chest X-ray., Cold and flu are by far the most common viral infections doctors see. However, there are a number of somewhat less common viral infections that also won't respond to antibiotic treatment.Croup, bronchiolitis, varicella (chickenpox), roseola, and hand, foot & mouth disease are caused by viruses too.Many of these resolve on their own; for example, foot, hand, and mouth disease usually passes within seven to ten days. For most of these viruses, good self-care (proper hygiene, nutrition, and rest) are the best treatment, but talk to your doctor.  Ask your doctor how long the virus will last and whether there are any ways to speed up the healing process.  Ask what you should be looking for as you monitor your symptoms, as some normally harmless viruses can progress and become dangerous. Foot, hand, and mouth disease, for example, can cause fatal brain inflammation in rare cases., Antibiotics either kill the bacteria or stop them from reproducing in your body. From there, your immune system can fight off the remaining infection.  Bacterial pneumonia is a common cause of fever.  The doctor will take a blood sample to determine which bacteria is causing the fever.  They will use that information to decide which antibiotic to use to fight the infection and reduce your fever.  Viruses and bacteria are the most common causes of fever, but they aren't the only ones. Fevers can also be caused by reactions to immunization, allergic reactions, and chronic inflammatory conditions such as IBS (inflammatory bowel disease) and arthritis.  If you get frequent or recurring fevers, talk to your doctor about potential causes. You may be able to treat the underlying condition and reduce the number of fevers you get.  You should not try to measure your own temperature rectally, so use the thermometer either orally or in the armpit. Clean the thermometer with cold water, then rubbing alcohol, then a final cold water rinse. Never use a thermometer that has been used rectally in your mouth.  Don't eat or drink anything for five minutes before taking your temperature. This could change the temperature in your mouth and lead to an inaccurate measurement.  Put the tip of the thermometer under your tongue and hold it still for about 40 seconds. Most digital thermometers beep to let you know when they've finished taking the measurement.  After reading the measurement, rinse the thermometer in cold water, clean with rubbing alcohol, and rinse again to sterilize.  Place the tip of the thermometer directly into your armpit. It should only be touching skin, not fabric from your shirt. Wait for about 40 seconds or until you hear the beep letting you know the measurement is finished.  Take the child’s temperature by which ever method they can realistically handle. A 2-year-old, for example, cannot hold a thermometer still under the tongue long enough to get an accurate reading. Ear thermometers have been met with mixed results. The most accurate measurement you can take is a rectal one, which is not painful for the child. This is recommended for children between three months and four years of age., After drying the tip, lubricate it with petroleum jelly for ease of movement.  Have the child lay down on their back, then lift their legs into the air. For babies, you should lift the legs like you would when changing a diaper.  Gently insert the thermometer about 1/2 to one inch into the rectum, but don't force it against resistance.  Hold the thermometer still for about 40 seconds or until it beeps to let you know the measurement is ready.  You may have heard that a healthy body temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), but this is merely a guideline. A normal body will fluctuate in temperature, even in the course of one day. Temperature is usually lower in the morning and warmer in the evening. Furthermore, some people simply have higher or lower resting temperatures. A healthy daily range can be from 97.5 to 98.8°F (36.4 to 37.1°C). The guidelines for feverish temperatures are as follows:  Children: 100.4°F (38°C) measured rectally; 99.5°F (37.5°C) measured orally; 99°F (37.2°C) measured in the armpit.Adults: 100.7°F (38.2°C) measured rectally; 100°F (37.8°C) measured orally; 99°F (37.2°C) measured in the armpit.  Temperatures under 100.4°F (38°C)are considered 'low-grade' fevers. You shouldn't worry about a fever until it reaches 102°F (38.9°C).  Viral infections don't respond well to treatment. But scientists have developed vaccines that can prevent a large number of viral infections. Talk to your doctor about which vaccinations they would recommend. Having children vaccinated at an early age can prevent many potentially serious illnesses later in life. Consider getting vaccinations against:  Pneumococcal infection, which protects against the bacteria that causes ear infection, sinus infection, pneumonia, meningitis, and sepsis.H influenzae, which causes upper respiratory infections like ear and sinus infections. It can also cause more serious infections like meningitis.  Children age 11 years and older should be vaccinated for meningitis.There is no evidence that vaccinating your child causes autism. Vaccinations must be licensed by the FDA and be extensively tested to show that they work. Vaccinating your child could save their life., This reduces your ability to fight off infection.  Try to get at least seven to eight hours of uninterrupted sleep every night to keep your immune system strong  , Nourish your body with whole foods like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Avoid processed foods, which tend to be high in sugars and saturated fats that are bad for your body.  Make sure to get 1000 mg of Vitamin C and 2000 iu of Vitamin D per day. Vitamins A and E are also important for their antioxidant properties.  Even when there's no visible illness around you, maintain good hygiene practices.  Wash your hands after leaving public spaces, and always wash them before eating. If you don't have access to water in public, carry a small bottle of hand sanitizer with you.  This leaves you vulnerable to illness. Make room in your life for relaxation and activities you enjoy, and try to be present in those moments when you have them.  Yoga and meditation are popular activities that help people reduce their stress levels. Aerobic exercise also has a significant impact on stress.  Try to get at least 150 minutes of aerobic exercise every week, in periods of 30 to 40 minutes.  When you exercise, aim for a target heart rate appropriate to your age. Calculate this by subtracting your age from the number 220.Target heart rate is 60-80% of your Max Heart Rate depending on fitness.

"If you have the space, a rustic, antique surface makes a quaint decoration and a convenient surface to arrange your towels on. Neatly pile your towels atop the chair, arranging them from largest to smallest.  Select either a low cabinet that sits on the ground or a high cabinet that must be nailed to the wall. By opting for a cabinet with a glass front, you can store your spare towels while simultaneously using them as decorations. Piles of crisp white towels can make your bathroom look cleaner and more refreshing, while piles of colorful towels can introduce contrast and vibrancy into the space.  You can also arrange the towels you presently need on top of the cabinet.  A bookshelf is functional and introduces a bit of visual interest into the room, since you would not typically expect to see one in a bathroom. Plus, a bookshelf pays homage to the idea of having “reading material” in the bathroom; though, whether you choose to include such material is entirely up to you. Pile your largest towels on the bottom shelves and your hand towels and washcloths on the mid-range shelves for easy access.  If you prefer to keep your towels out of sight, you can arrange them inside a more decorative surface, like a large, lidded wicker basket. You can also introduce a more functional piece into the room, like a window bench or vanity seat with built-in storage.  ","fold your towels and sit them on a vintage chair, table, or bench. put up glass-front towel cabinets. use a small bookshelf if you have a large enough bathroom. hide your towels away in a decorative or practical container.

"Mosquitoes are often attracted to water, especially standing water. Examples of mosquito breeding grounds include old tires, driveway puddles, clogged gutters, unfiltered fish ponds, empty flowerpots, and any item that can hold water for more than a few days at a time.  Use a push broom to distribute the water for small puddles on hard surfaces. Use a siphon pump for larger puddles.  If you're inundated by mosquitoes due to standing water from street curbs, drainage ditches or other pools you cannot control, call the responsible public authority to explain that you believe the water has become a mosquito breeding source.  If it is not possible to remove particular water source, place some Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (BTI) dunks/granules into the water. BTI is a species of bacteria that functions as a larvicide and will kill mosquito larvae for as long as a month, in addition to being safe and non-toxic to children/pets., If you have a koi pond or swimming pool that doesn't see much use, it may become a breeding ground for mosquitoes. Do yourself and your neighbors a favor by doing regular maintenance to keep the water fresh and flowing.Cut back vegetation from around your pond or other water features.  If you have a birdbath or another small source of water, change the water frequently or agitate it so mosquitoes won't lay eggs there.  Treat your pool with the proper chemicals to make it uninhabitable for mosquitoes.  Too much grass and shrubbery can create breeding and hiding grounds for mosquitoes. Be sure to regularly mow your lawn and use hedge trimmers to cut back shrubs and other vegetation.  ","dump or flush out any stagnant water sources in your yard. maintain water features and swimming pools. keep your grass mowed regularly and trim your shrubs. "
"You will have to bring out a very small version of your cheat sheet for this to work. Type up a cheat sheet on a computer, using the smallest font possible. Most people can't read smaller than an 8 point font. Then, print out the paper and cut out the section that contains the text.Roll the cheat sheet tightly enough that you can slip inside your mechanical pencil.  When you're struggling during the exam, pretend that you need to reload your pencil with lead. Slip out your cheat sheet and quickly take a look.  Be careful. You will have to glance at the sheet quickly. You should also hold your pencil slightly below your desk as you pretend to reload the lead. You do not want your teacher, or anyone else, to see you are using a cheat sheet.;  , You can purchase invisible ink at many department stores, and you can also buy it online. Buy the type of invisible ink that shows up in UV light. You should also buy a keychain flashlight that gives off UV light.Write your cheat sheet down in invisible ink. Bring it to class the day of the exam. Your teacher will probably not worry about a seemingly blank piece of paper out on your desk. Keep your keychain in your hand during the exam, or set it out on your desk. You can pretend you're fiddling with it out of nerves.  When the exam begins, subtly shine your flashlight on the piece of paper when you're stumped. It's a good idea to sit in back, to minimize the risk of getting caught.  When you write your cheat sheet, set another piece of paper down below it. Press very hard when you write. The words should be lightly imprinted on the blank sheet of paper. Take it to class on the day of your exam and keep it out on your desk. If your teachers asks, tell her it's scrap paper you intend to use for brainstorming.If you're having trouble reading the words, use your pencil to lightly shade the paper. This should make the words more legible.  Type up your cheat sheet using very small font. Usually, size 8 is the smallest font people can read. Print out the cheat sheet, and cut the section containing text out.Buy a pack of gum. Make sure the kind you purchase contains individually wrapped portions of gum. Remove the foil from one stick of gum.  Take your cheat sheet and wrap it round the stick of gum. Re-wrap the gum in foil.  During the exam, pretend you're getting a stick of gum. Glance at the cheat sheet as you rewrap the gum and find the answer you need.  If you're not allowed to chew gum in class, this method will not work. Check your school's policy before attempting this method.  For a math class, especially an advanced math course, you're usually allowed a calculator. If you have a graphing calculator, there is usually a function you can use to save notes, graphs, and equations. This can work great on a math exam, as a teacher is unlikely to get suspicious of you using a calculator. He or she will assume you're simply typing in calculations.On a graphing calculator, you can usually press a button that says 'program' and then press 'new.' You will then be taken to a screen where you type in formulas.  To access this information, press 'Edit.' Scroll down and find the note that you made with the equations and select it.  Every graphing calculator is different. The process on yours may vary. Refer to the instruction's manual for precise directions on adding notes to your calculator.  An audio cheat sheet can work as well as a pen and paper one. You can make a recording of yourself listing basic information. Then, upload that recording to a portable electronic device, like an iPhone or iPod.If you do not already have one, stop by an electronics store and purchase small wireless headphones. You can synch these with your device and place the headphones in prior to your exam. Your teacher is unlikely to see them.  You can play your recording on a loop. However, some devices come with a small microphone that takes commands. You may be able to make a noise, like a small cough, to signal your recording to play when you get confused.  This is a simple method, but can be effective. As long as you hold the phone still, and focus, a cheat sheet should be legible on a phone camera. You will probably have to zoom in to read some of the information, but this can be a simple way to sneak your cheat sheet into your exam.Keep in mind, teachers usually do not allow phones out during an exam. A teacher will likely get very suspicious if he or she sees you using your phone.  Therefore, sit in the back of class. Be very careful when checking your phone. You can pretend you're getting something from a purse or backpack and glance at your phone. You can also keep your phone under your desk, and subtly glance at it when necessary.  Some iPods allow you to upload notes. You can type your cheat sheet into your iPod and look at the notes when necessary during the exam. A teacher may be less suspicious of an iPod than a smart phone, as a teacher may not think an iPod does anything other than play music.You may be able to keep your iPod on your desk during the exam. You can walk into the exam listening to headphones and then casually set your iPod down on your desk.  In the event your teacher asks you to move your iPod, keep it under your desk or balance it on your knee. Quickly glance down at your iPod when necessary during the exam.  Sit in the back of the room to avoid being caught checking your iPod.  Every school has a different policy regarding cheating. You want to make sure cheating is worth the risk for you before attempting to do so. Read up on the penalties for cheating in your school's handbook.Some schools may give you a failing grade if you get caught cheating. This can affect your report card grade at the end of the term.  You may also be sent to the principal's office. Your parents may be called, leading to trouble at home.  If you're in college, you may receive a failing grade for the semester in the event you cheat.  Everyone slips up once in awhile, but cheating can be a real problem if it's habitual. The more often you cheat, the more likely you are to get caught. Cheating can also prevent you from learning valuable information.It's a bad idea to cheat at all. However, if you feel the need to do so, try not to cheat on every test or exam.  Avoid cheating unless there were specific, extenuating circumstances that prevented you from studying.  There is no shame in asking for help. If you're cheating because you don't understand a subject, reach out to someone for guidance.You can start seeing a tutor. If your school offers free tutoring programs, make use of those.  You can also ask your teacher for help. Most teachers do not want to see their students struggle.  Tell your parents and friends if you're struggling with a class. They can help support you as you try to improve your performance.

"Most cases of placenta previa are diagnosed during a routine appointment. Whether you have concerns about this condition or not, regular prenatal care is one of the most important aspects of a healthy pregnancy. See your midwife or obstetrician regularly, and do not skip appointments.  Getting regular care means seeing your doctor as soon as you think you're pregnant. After that, your doctor will schedule appointments as needed.;  , In general, you should contact your doctor if you have vaginal bleeding at any point in your pregnancy; it can indicate a potential miscarriage or a number of other problems. If you have bright red bleeding (but no pain) at any point from the second trimester onward, it may also be a symptom of placenta previa.Bleeding related to placenta previa can be light or heavy, and it is not necessarily constant; it may stop and then recur.  If your bleeding is heavy, it's best to go to the emergency room instead of waiting to hear from your doctor., To confirm the presence of placenta previa, your doctor will order an ultrasound to view the location of your placenta. In some cases, you may need to undergo both an abdominal and a transvaginal ultrasound. Transvaginal ultrasounds are performed by inserting a narrow transducer into your vagina.You may also need an MRI, but that test is not often done., Like bleeding, contractions before your ninth month always merit a visit to your doctor. These contractions might indicate preterm labor or other problems, or they may be a sign of placenta previa.It can be difficult to distinguish between true contractions and the normal Braxton-Hicks contractions that many women notice during pregnancy. Do not feel worried or embarrassed about checking with your doctor to be sure. Generally, the cliché that it’s better to be safe than sorry applies here.  If your doctor diagnoses you with placenta previa, ask for the specifics. There are several different kinds, including a low-lying placenta, a partial placenta previa, and a total placenta previa.A low-lying placenta means that the placenta is attached to the lower part of your uterus but is not covering the cervix. These cases often resolve themselves before delivery; the placenta may move upward as your pregnancy advances.A partial placenta previa means that the placenta is covering part of the cervix, but not all of it. Many of these cases also resolve themselves before delivery.A total placenta previa covers the cervical opening completely, making a normal vaginal delivery unlikely. These cases are much less likely to clear up before delivery., Several factors put you more at risk for this condition. For instance, if you are over 30 or have had a pregnancy before, you are at a higher risk for this condition. Also, if you are having more than one baby or if you have scarring in your uterus, you're at higher risk for placenta previa.It's important to stop smoking while pregnant for a number of reasons, but it also increases your chance of developing this condition., One treatment for placenta previa is just to slow down some. In other words, you'll want to take some of your more strenuous activities off the table. You won't be able to do exercises or many of your normal activities.In addition, you shouldn't travel if you have this condition., If you are not experiencing heavy bleeding, your doctor may prescribe bed rest at home. The specifics may vary depending on your particular case, but in general, bed rest is just like it sounds: you’ll lie down most of the time and sit or stand only when necessary.However, bed rest can cause health risks, including Deep Vein Thrombosis, so it is less commonly recommended than it used to be.If your doctor recommends bed rest, ask her for her rationale or get a second opinion.  Pelvic rest means that you cannot perform activities involving your vaginal area. You can't have sex, douche, or wear a tampon, for instance., If you have a low-lying placenta or a partial placenta previa, the issue may resolve itself. Some women with these mild forms of the condition find that by the time they deliver, the placenta has moved., The biggest risk to your health is the heavy bleeding that can accompany placenta previa. Occasionally, women with placenta previa experience uterine hemorrhages that could potentially be fatal. Whether you are at home or in the hospital, watch for signs of heavy bleeding.If you notice sudden heavy bleeding, it's best to go to the emergency room.  When you have this condition, your doctor will likely limit the time she spends examining you vaginally, as that can exacerbate the condition. In addition, she will use ultrasounds to determine where the baby is over time, and your baby's heartbeat may need to be looked at more closely., While medications will not directly treat the condition, you may be given drugs to prolong the pregnancy (so you don't give birth early), as well as corticosteroids to help your baby's lungs develop if you must give birth early. You may also be given blood transfusions due to blood loss., Because this condition can become severe, you may need to go to the hospital for medical care at any given point. If you start bleeding or your bleeding becomes suddenly heavier, you need to go to the emergency room., If you are bleeding moderately to heavily, your doctor may recommend that you enter the hospital. In the hospital, you will be able to lie down most of the time with medical personnel available if any problem arises., If your bleeding cannot be controlled or if you or your baby show signs of considerable distress, your doctor may need to perform a cesarean section. This step may be necessary even if you are not yet approaching your due date.If you are not bleeding heavily and the placenta is blocking the cervix, you may be able to have a natural birth.However, about 3/4 of women who have this condition in the third trimester are not able to give birth vaginally. Doctors commonly recommend delivering a few weeks early with this condition.If you have had a prior caesarean delivery and have placenta previa, you are at higher risk for a condition called placenta accreta. This is a serious condition in which the placenta does not detach after childbirth. You will need to make sure you deliver in a hospital that is prepared for this situation, including having a well-stocked blood bank., Read up on placenta previa and cesarean section, which may be a necessary consequence of the condition. Feeling more informed may make you feel less anxious and more in control., Talk to your partner or to a trusted friend or relative about any sadness, depression, frustration, worry, or anxiety you may be feeling. It’s natural to experience these feelings when your pregnancy does not go as you anticipated, and it’s vital to get these emotions out into the open.Another option is to join an online support group. Online support groups exist for people with placenta previa and people on bed rest. Consider joining one. These groups can provide much-needed commiseration and suggestions for coping strategies., If you are stuck in bed, either at home or at the hospital, try to make the best of the situation. Be productive in ways that are compatible with bed rest: research and purchase baby supplies online, write thank you notes to people who have sent gifts, and take care of any work-related obligations that you can do from bed. But don’t forget to spend time on the things that will make you feel calmer, happier, or less bored.For instance, you could watch your favorite movies or TV shows, read a good book, play computer or video games, have phone or Skype conversations with friends and family members, challenge someone to a board or card game, or keep a journal or a blog.  Having placenta previa is certainly not ideal, and bed rest can be a challenge. However, with proper treatment, you can expect to have a healthy baby, as most women with this condition do.  ","get regular prenatal care. see your doctor if you notice any vaginal bleeding. request an ultrasound. seek help for early contractions. ask for a specific diagnosis. know the risk factors. slow down. ask your doctor for an explanation if she prescribes bed rest. follow orders about pelvic rest. check with your doctor about the severity of your case. monitor your bleeding. understand how future doctor's visits will go. know what drugs may be used. be ready to get emergency medical care. consider hospitalization. have a cesarean section if necessary. educate yourself. get support. make bed rest as pleasant as possible. don’t panic.

"To prepare your tomato plants to be transferred outdoors, start your seedlings indoors while it is still cold outside. Cool temperatures in early spring can stunt growth or even kill young seedlings. Start your seedlings indoors to improve your production chances.  You can find these pots at your local nursery or garden supply store.  For example, one mix could be made using 1/3 peat moss, 1/3 coarse vermiculite, and 1/3 compost. Just make sure to water it before you sow your seeds.  Cover with soil and pat down lightly.  When the seeds germinate, move them into full sun or under grow lights.  When you start to see sprouts, you can water less frequently. More plants are killed by too much water (that rots the roots) than too little water so water sparingly after the plants sprout.  You can also soak the seeds flat in water, so the roots are watered from the bottom up. Misting may not get enough water to the roots.  Once the plants peek out of the soil, they will grow pretty fast.  ","start tomato plants from seeds indoors 6 to 8 weeks before your last frost. purchase plastic peat pots or similar small pots for growing seedlings. fill your peat pot with the moistened soil mix of your choice. sow 2 to 3 seeds 1/4-inch deep in soil in each pot. store the containers in room of 70 to 80 °f (21 to 27 °c) until germination occurs. mist the seeds daily for the first 7 to 10 days. check your pots every day.

"Who do you hang around with? Are they the crazy type? While you are in Middle school / Junior High you do not want to act like somebody you're not. If you're not generally the popular type, stop trying your luck in that big group of kids. Don't bother to pretend to be something your not or you will be wasting your time completely. The popular kids are usually not the nicest, but at the same time they are still reasonable people. If you're not the sporty type, don't bother joining that sports club just because it looks cool. Find something that suits you and friends who love you for who you are.;  , It's perfectly fine to have friends and be nice with everyone but if you are ashamed of some of the things coming from their mouths maybe its time you find others that don't embarrass you to the point you could rip out all of your hair. In middle school squads are really important.  You don't need to be trying too hard to be someone else's friend it will make you look desperate. While you're in school it's better to be yourself and have people accept you for who you are inside, even if you are loud and carefree! This might seem corny/ stupid, but I have been through middle school before. You should try to be everyone's friend and be as nice as possible (there's no point having fights just because you can) but don't try to buy the same clothes as someone thinking you're 'fitting in'. Really, you're just looking like a copy cat. If you have to change yourself to fit in with a certain group, change your circle of friends! Keep your secrets to yourself  , If you are mean to people others are intimidated and really want nothing to do with you and that's how it'll stay. You don't want yourself looking like the school bully and an awful person to be friends with. You want to be a really nice person and have both boy and girl friends.Never be the bad guy in a situation.  If you notice someone if feeling sad, try to cheer them up because then you'll look like a nicer person and people will like you for it. if you help teachers you'll carry out a better reputation and then you'll be less likely to be blamed for any occurrence in the class.  If you cuss just because you think its funny, its not. Actually cussing is highly unattractive and people won't want you to be at their houses in fear that their parents will hear you and then they'll get in trouble by their parents thinking they're in with the wrong crowd. If you don't usually swear, don't do it just to fit in. Some middle schools have drugs, but trust me STAY AWAY. Is being cool worth having an addiction?  , It's not about the most popular shoes, it's about what shoes you want. Individualism is hard to find in a middle school because people get made fun of for wearing things that others may not particularly like. This is why you'll see kids wearing name- brand clothes so that they'll fit in and look good. Yes, Wearing name brands are in style but are you wearing too much? Take a minute to examine your closet and see how many shirts have brand names like 'Aeropostale' written across the front. You seem like a billboard wearing things with names written across the front as if advertising them. Try wearing things occasionally that don't have a name across it.  No one likes a perv. So don't always pop sexual jokes out of nowhere. Don't say anything about rape or having sex with somebody, it really makes you look dumb. If you say something weird that would make someone else think you are stalking them a rumor may get spread and you may get a horrible reputation as the weirdo.  Don't think for one minute that by having sex when you aren't ready, doing drugs, something illegal, or crude is going to make you popular because it won't. It'll really get you in serious trouble and possibly screw up your entire life. Having sex when you aren't ready(especially in school) could get you labeled as insecure or clingy and to top that off without protection you could be a mommy or daddy. And its really awful to hear a 13- 14 year- old getting pregnant, nobody would like that and it'd screw up job opportunities and other important things in life. Drugs could get you on parole and kicked out of school and really screw up your record. Try to stay clean throughout your school life, no matter how hard it can be sometimes.  ","decide where you want to fit in. pick your friends wisely. don't try too hard. understand that being mean gets you nowhere. help out. don't try to be bad. wear what you want to wear. don't be a pervert. keep a head on your shoulders.

"Go to class prepared--look at your class syllabus and write down which texts you should read before each class. Make a schedule for how much reading you will do every day. It’s important to do the reading before class so that you understand the lecture or discussion while it’s happening, rather than being confused and unprepared in the moment.  While you read, take notes where you summarize what’s happening in your own words, note unfamiliar words, and write your thoughts down. Reread a text if you find it dense or confusing the first time--sometimes professors and teachers choose challenging texts that deserve a second look. In order to maximize productivity, take a ten minute break for every fifty minutes that you read.  Keep a dictionary near where you study, and write down the names and definitions of unfamiliar words you come across. If your teacher or professor allows it, use websites such as Sparknotes, Shmoop, and BookRags for plot summaries and refreshers on character names. These sources, however, should only serve to supplement your basic knowledge of the assigned texts. All your thinking and ideas for your essays should come only from you.  Maybe you have a good friend in the class with whom you can chat over coffee or you want to organize a weekly study group. Talking about the assigned texts in a group can help you gain new understandings of the text, answer your questions, and get further enjoyment out of what you read. If your literature class has exams, your study group can help you review the important plot points, details, and themes in the assigned texts.  ","do your reading before class. read and reread the assigned texts carefully. use outside tools to help you understand the assignments further. talk about the assigned texts with people in your class.

"Torx screws have a star-shaped pattern on the head and are very popular screws for all purposes. Security torx screws will have a nub in the middle of the screw head that needs to be accounted for.  Torx screws can be easy to damage so be very careful when using an alternative tool to unscrew these screws.  Insert the flat head screwdriver between two opposite edges of the screw head. Turn counterclockwise to remove the screw. Make sure you turn slowly so as not to damage the head.  For security torx screws you will need to insert the flat head in against one of the outer grooves and the center nub of the head. This works much the same as non-security torx screws.  Security torx screws will usually turn the opposite direction, so you should turn clockwise to remove them.  If you have a normal torx screwdriver but not a security version then you can simply remove the center pin out of the screw head. Take a hammer and a punch or other chisel-like tool and line up the chisel at the bottom of the pin. Gently tap on the top of the chisel to remove the center pin., If you have a security torx screw and wish to remove using a non-security torx driver or drill bit then you can drill a small hole in the drill bit. This way it has a small hole to accommodate the center pin on your security torx screw.  Take a plastic toothbrush and lightly melt the end using a lighter or other source of heat. Once the plastic is soft you can insert it in the head of the screw and allow the plastic to harden once more. Once it is hard try to turn the screw counterclockwise to unscrew it.  ","use this method if you have a torx screw. use a small flat head screwdriver. break out the pin on security torx screws. drill a small hole in the tip of your torx driver. try a plastic toothbrush.

"This helps especially when you have to travel a long way.;  , In the personal bag, include personal necessities (like clothes and toiletries). Make sure to take a good pair of sunglasses and a jacket.You never know when you will need them.  This should include things like books, an iPod, a portable DVD player with some DVDs, a phone , a camera, a hand-a phone charger, a pack of cards, a notebook or sketchbook, magazines, an e-reader, a tablet, newspapers, a laptop, puzzles, audio books for when you stop, and anything else that entertains you.  This should have small meals, as well as snacks. These can include thing in thermoses, sandwiches and wraps, cold pizza, chips, pretzels, energy bars, crackers, and anything else you like to eat. Also include small deserts, like a box of chocolate truffles. Add some drinks, like water, juice, lemonade, and soda (in insulated water bottles). Finally, add some gum, mints like Mentos and Tic Tacs'. Be sure not to bring plastic-throw-away water bottles, especially when you're traveling to a warmer climate; the sun can affect how the water tastes.  This should include a flashlight, an extra (charged) phone, a first-aid kit, batteries, a radio, can of oil, a carton of gas, and an extra tire.  This should include car chargers for every device you brought. This way you can charge things when they run out.  Every person should have a wallet with a hefty amount of money. At least one person should have a credit card.  Getting lost during a road trip isn't very fun at all.  Which one depends on the car. Either way, have each person make a long playlist with upbeat songs that you can enjoy while driving. Play these playlists in turn as you drive. Sing along to every song you know.  This is common and easy, especially if the other passengers are close to you.  Eat, run around, or go to the bathroom so you're ready for the next leg of the drive. If the rest stop is a mall (or some other place where there are activities), embrace it and spend an hour there. You might even want to plan them out in advance so that you don't starve when you find out that the next exit doesn't have a McDonald's!  , This ensures that you won't feel the need to check what time it is. People who really get the urge a lot should set it to ring every 30 minutes and say the time (if possible).  This could be a journal, scrapbook, video diary, or website.

"Powdercoating is done with thermoplastic or thermoset polymer powder, and these materials are formulated for bonding with different base metals to give the best results.  See the next section for a detailed discussion of the differences between thermoset and thermoplastic coats. What's good for a car may not be good for a small trinket or decoration.;  , It sounds simple, but many people forget this step. The powder coat you apply will adhere to everything (if properly done) on your rig, making sealed surfaces, bearings, clamps, bolts and nuts, etc. useless after blasting., Using bead or abrasive blasting on hard metal, such as cast iron or steel, will remove mill and rust scale, dirt and foreign materials. Chemical solvent cleaning will remove any grease, oil, or paint, and light sanding can be done to finish preparing the surface. Aluminum, magnesium, and other soft alloy metals can be solvent cleaned and wire brushed, or sanded if needed.  For example, you might sand-blast whatever you want to powder coat until it's down to bare metal. This is the first step in the process. If you don't have access to a sandblaster, you can also use a wire wheel, bench-grinder, or even sandpaper. Just as long as you get the material down to bare metal.  The next step is to strip the metal of any remaining grime or gunk. You can achieve this by soaking the item in acetone (if the item is small enough) or by wiping it with an acetone-soaked rag.  This is done using a 'gun' or compressed air sprayer which electrostatically charges the powder material so that it sticks to the grounded base metal object receiving the coating. These guns are available from various suppliers, and cost as little as $100. For experimental purposes, you can apply the powder to a flat metal surface by dusting it directly on, and spreading it to a thin, even layer.  Make sure you have your electrostatic charge hooked up to whatever part you are coating. The powder you use won't properly adhere unless it's given a charge to hold onto.  After applying the coat but before curing, be careful not to brush or blow on the powder coat, as this will cause some of the powder to fall off, leaving you with a less precise coat.  A conventional oven is suitable for this purpose if the metal is small enough to fit, otherwise, an infrared heat lamp or other flame less heat source needs to be used. Normally, the object is heated to 350° to 375° F (175° to 190° C) for about 10 to 15 minutes, and allowed to cool.  You can use a conventional oven to powder coat smaller items. Just be sure that you won't be using the oven to cook food after the powder coating. Once you've used an oven to powder coat, it absolutely should not be used for cooking.  ","determine the type of material you are going to powdercoat and then select a suitable powder for the finish. disassemble all threaded or lubricated interfaces before you begin, including anything you don't want coated. clean the base metal thoroughly. apply the powder to the object to be powder coated. cure the metal at a temperature appropriate for the powder material you use.

"Since internships are meant specifically for people to gain experience in a field, they're the first step for many people who want to learn more about human resources. Because there is a great deal of administrative work in HR, many large and mid-sized departments regularly hire interns to help.;  , If you're currently employed, there may be projects going on in your own company's HR department that need staffing. Contact your HR representative and ask whether you can help. Not all projects involve confidential data, so you might be able to gain hands-on HR experience and learn more about your company in the process. If you already work in a division of your company's HR department, volunteer to help out in other divisions. For example, if you work in the benefits department, you might offer to help the recruitment department interview candidates at an upcoming career fair.  Many small nonprofit groups do not have dedicated HR professionals, and there are no special credentials required to practice HR. If you're willing to work for free to gain HR experience, volunteering can help you gain exposure to higher level work than you might find in an entry-level HR job.  Because HR is a field with a great deal of paperwork to process, there are usually a number of administrative positions in personnel departments. Many people seeking careers in human resources overlook these entry-level roles, but the people who fill them often are promoted over time. Many HR leaders started out as file clerks or receptionists.  Agencies that place temporary personnel can be a great way to gain experience in areas that overlap into HR. Staffing companies evaluate, interview, hire and place large volumes of candidates, and experience in these areas can position you for a corporate recruiting position in a larger HR department. Unlike HR departments, staffing agencies frequently hire people from sales positions or recent college graduates, and usually do not require HR experience to get started.  Networking with other HR professionals can help you find entry-level opportunities that you might not find elsewhere. Many open positions are not advertised, but are filled through word-of-mouth. Joining a professional association and attending meetings and other networking events regularly will help you meet people who are filling HR positions. Most HR organizations hold an annual conference, which is another opportunity to gain exposure to HR professionals and learn more about various topics in the field.  The Human Resources Certification Institute (HRCI) offers 4 types of certification: Professional in Human Resources (PHR), Senior Professional in Human Resources (SPHR), Global Professional in Human Resources (GPHR), and certification for HR professionals in the state of California (PHR-CA and SPHR-CA). The Society for Human Resource Management offers extensive educational opportunities, including preparation courses for the various levels of certification.  There are numerous blogs, Facebook and LinkedIn groups, Twitter lists and other online networking opportunities available for people who want to connect with others in the profession. Many HR associations now offer online networking opportunities as well, which allow you to connect with hiring professionals outside your geographic area. The Society for Human Resource Management, for example, has a members-only section of its website called 'HR Talk,' which allows members to discuss a variety of HR-related topics.  Human resources is a profession with a broad subset of areas, from compensation and benefits to recruiting to labor relations. Most HR professionals (especially those who rise to an executive level) spend time in several of these areas at some point in their careers. It's generally easier to find work in benefits in the fall, when HR departments are getting ready for open enrollment. Recruiting departments tend to be busiest at the beginning of a fiscal year and after the holidays, when hiring picks up, so those are the best times to volunteer to help. Compensation departments typically have a set cycle for reviewing organizational pay practices, so determining what that time frame is will help you choose the best time to offer your services in order to gain experience.  ","find an internship in an hr department. look for work with your current company. volunteer for a nonprofit organization. consider taking an administrative support job in human resources. work for a staffing company. join an organization for hr professionals. pursue certification. network online with people in hr. be open to starting out in different disciplines within hr.

"Before you begin draining your water heater, you will first need to find the main power source and turn it off.  The breaker box or fuse box is usually a small, grey power panel (about the size of a shoebox) with a swinging door. It is often attached to a wall. In some homes, it is located in the garage and in others it can be on the outside of the house.The thermostat for the gas heater is usually a red knob located on the outside of the heater where the gas pipe enters the unit. The knob should have 3 settings: 'Pilot,' 'On,' and 'Off.';  , This will cease power to the water heater or the entire house, depending on which circuit/fuse you disable.  You should see small on/off switches. These are called 'branch circuits breakers,' and they provide protection against electrical overload to different circuits powering your house. If you know which branch circuit breaker is powering your water heater, turn this individual switch off.  If you don't know which individual circuit breaker is powering your heater, locate a larger switch labeled 'Main' above the branch circuit breakers. The main circuit breaker should have higher amperage values like 100, 150, or 200. The branch circuit breakers will have lower numbers from 10-60amps. Turn the main power off, but know that all the power to your house will be shut off for the time-being.  If you open the box and find round, glass topped shapes or small tubes with metal ends, you have a fuse box, not a breaker box.In this case, you will need to unscrew and remove the fuse that is powering your water heater (similar to turning off the branch circuit breaker). If you are unsure of which fuse to remove, look for a large rectangular box with a handle/lever at the top of the panel. Tug hard and straight out on the handle, but be careful because the metal parts may be hot.The power to your entire house has now been shut off.  The shut-off valve should be located at or near the cold water inlet pipe at the top of the tank.  There are two types of valves in use: ball valves and gate valves. A 90-degree turn closes and opens the ball valve, but a gate valve takes many turns.  Some gate valves have a 'stop' before they are fully closed or open, so be sure you turn the valve past that stop. Gas and propane supply valves for non-electric heaters can be left on.  For natural gas and propane (LP) water heaters, make a note of what the temperature setting is and then turn the thermostat, the large red dial on the front of the control, to the lowest setting, or 'Pilot.'  If you plan to use the water for other purposes, turn the heat off ahead of time and allow the water to cool overnight before draining.  This will prevent a vacuum from forming in the lines keeping water trapped. A similar example of this is when you cover the top of a straw to retain water.  The drain cock usually looks like a regular hose bib, such as a garden faucet, or a round dial with a threaded hole in the middle.  The drain cock may be hidden under a removable cover.  If you don't have a garden hose, you can use a bucket to catch the water and dump it somewhere safe manually. Don't overfill the bucket since the hot water can soften cheaper plastic buckets or can burn you., Either run your hose to an outside drain or to your driveway.  If you allowed the water to cool overnight, you can drain it into buckets and save the water to use on the yard or for other purposes. Don't use it for delicate plants, though, or to wash your car, given the presence of sediment.  If draining hot water, also be careful of the materials you use. Low-quality hoses and buckets may soften due to the heat, causing leaks. To simplify the process, drain straight into a suitable basement drain or sump hole.  Cover the drain cock and hose connection with a towel or rag to prevent scorching water from bursting and spraying in case there is a pressure leak especially if the water heater supplies a second floor or if located in a basement.  Consider opening the pressure-relief valve, usually on the top of the unit, to allow water to flow freely. But DO NOT open the pressure-relief valve without first placing a bucket under the discharge pipe. Opening it can allow water to drain onto the floor unless something is placed under the discharge pipe to catch the water.  The pressure relief valve is usually a lever that you flip into an 'up' position to open it.  Make sure water flows at a rate that wherever you are draining to can be managed.  Caution: If you did not allow the water to cool, it will be extremely hot as it leaves the tank. Also, realize that if the drain cock is made of plastic and the heater is several years old, it may be difficult to open and may break if forced.  Allow the water in the bucket to stand undisturbed for a minute and see if the water is clear or if any sand-like material settles to the bottom.  If the water is cloudy or you see sand-like material on the bottom of the bucket, continue draining the tank until the water is clear (free of sediment or discoloration). If the tank is empty but you suspect sediment remains, turn the cold-water supply back on to allow more water into the unit. Fill the tank partially and then drain it again. Repeat this process until the discharge is clear.  If the water is clear and you see no sediment , you may carry on to the next step.  Close the pressure-relief valve if opened.  Also remember to turn off the hot water faucet in your sink or tub.  When the tank is full and the pressure has equalized, slowly reopen the pressure-relief valve to bleed off the excess air.  This will keep the water heater from 'pinging' as cold water re-enters it during normal use. After all the compressed air has escaped, close the pressure-relief valve again.  Open the hot water tap in the bathroom to bleed air.  Do not turn on the power yet. If you turn the power on without filling, the heating element can be damaged. Open the hot water tap on the bathtub or wash basin and wait for a full stream of water.  After the hot water tap is running at full volume, it is safe to turn on the circuit breaker or fuse box.  Wait for about 20 minutes and then test for hot water at the bathtub.  Listen carefully to the water heater to determine if it is working.  ","locate the breaker/fuse box for an electrical heater or the thermostat for a gas heater. disable the circuit or fuse that powers the electrical water heater, or turn the thermostat to 'pilot' on a gas heater. turn off your cold water supply by rotating the water shut-off valve clockwise. open the hot water faucet in your sink or tub. attach a garden hose to the drain cock, or valve, located at the bottom of the heater. extend the garden hose to a place where the water from the heater can safely discharge. open the drain cock to allow the water to exit the heater. fill a 'test' bucket with the still flushing water after a few minutes of flushing. close the drain cock and remove the garden hose. turn the water supply back on and let the tank fill. close the water heater drain. turn the water supply back on and wait until the hot water line begins running continuously. turn off the tub spigot.

"Your doctor may be able to suggest groups that meet via the hospital or you can search online for gatherings in your area. Look for groups composed of pregnant women who may be experiencing similar emotions as you. If you don’t feel comfortable meeting in person, you can always find online support and chat groups as well.  When you attend, listen actively but also jump in with questions and share your thoughts. Talking with others will show that your struggles with negative emotions are important, but not necessarily unusual.  To find support groups online, you might search for 'prenatal support' 'pregnancy support group' or 'prenatal depression discussion (or support) group.' The PANDAS Foundation of the UK offers both online and telephone support for pregnant women and new mothers. The BabyCenter community pages are another good option as well.  Prenatal depression is also called 'antenatal' depression, so look for resources using that term as well.  Check out the Antenatal Depression Forum at Netmums., Your hospital or another health agency in your area will likely offer a wide variety of classes designed for new parents. These classes will teach you practical matters, such as how to change a diaper, which will make you feel even more competent moving forward. They also give you the chance to spend time with a group of people who are working through the stages of pregnancy., If you have a partner, spend time doing something that you both enjoy, such as going to a movie. This may help to counter any loneliness that you might feel. It also reinforces the fact that you should approach pregnancy as a team.  Ask your partner for help and tell them that you appreciate what they do. They will likely reciprocate in kind, leading to positive, open communication patterns. You might say, “Thank you for hanging those pictures in the nursery, they look really great.”  If you do not have a partner, you can find a great support network in other single mothers. Reach out to them via online networks and use your pregnancy to develop strong friendships.  ","join a support group. enroll in pregnancy and childbirth classes. strengthen your bond with your partner. "
"One of the simplest, most beginner-friendly ways to remove chrome is via simple mechanical action - i.e., scrubbing with an abrasive. Mix baking soda or a solid household cleanser with water to make an abrasive paste that can be rubbed onto the chrome with a soft cloth until the chrome begins to give way. This method may work best with especially thin, weak chrome plating or with 'fake' chrome plating (for example, plastic painted with a fake 'chrome' material). Even in these cases, considerable elbow grease may be required.  Check your progress frequently as you scrub. Scrubbing for too long may scratch the underlying material.  Some types of chrome (especially fake plastic variants like you may find on model cars, etc.) can be removed with commercial-grade oven cleaners. These powerful de-greasing solutions usually come in an aerosol can as a foam or liquid spray. Give your chrome part a generous coating of cleaner, then allow it to sit for 10 minutes. Wipe the chrome off along with the spray-cleaner.  Note that some oven spray-cleaner may darken any underlying metal if left to sit too long, so you may want to apply the process repeatedly in short increments until you have the result you want.  Another favorite method of model car enthusiasts for removing chrome is the use of a bleach bath. In this method, chromed parts are simply submerged bleach and left to sit. After about a day, depending on its thickness, the chrome should be loosened if not stripped entirely.  The primary benefit of this method compared to the others is that bleach should leave any primer below the outer chrome layer intact.  After using bleach to remove chrome, it should be properly disposed of and never re-used (for laundry, etc.)  , Standard automotive brake fluid works like paint thinner to remove chrome layers from plastic objects. However, this method can take several days to work. Additionally, it requires the proper handling and disposal of the brake fluid, which is toxic. Rub the chrome object with brake fluid and let it set about 10 minutes before rinsing it off. Repeat as needed to completely strip the chrome.  Note that brake fluid can dissolve plastic, so be very cautious when using this method on chromed plastic parts (or opt for another method).  ","use a homemade abrasive to remove especially thin or weak chrome. use oven cleaner. soak the chromed item in household bleach. use brake fluid to remove chrome plating. "

"If an attacker approaches you, you need to stay calm. Any sudden moves or actions may startle them and escalate the violence. Take deep breaths as you size each other up to stay relaxed and focused., There are different types of attackers and they are all motivated for many different reasons. The person may be a mugger or a criminal looking for something “fun” to do by harassing you. They could be mentally unstable or under the influence or drugs or alcohol. You may have caught them in the act of some other crime, and now they feel the need to “get rid of you”. Either way, try to figure out what kind of person you’re dealing with., Engaging with the person and talking to them may help. Ask them why they are attacking you, and if there is anything that you can do to prevent the attack.If they are a mugger, they will ask for your valuables. This will be easy enough to deal with: all you have to do is give up your things. While it may be hard to part with some of your valuables, it will be worth your life. Phones and jewelry can be replaced, but your life and health cannot.  If the person is looking to pick a fight, let them know that you have no interest in violence. If they are especially menacing or threatening, talking may not be an option, but try it anyway.  If the person seems mentally unstable or under the influence of a substance, they will be far too unpredictable for you to deal with. These are often the most dangerous kind of attackers because it is very hard to judge what they are going to do next. Try talking to them in a calm, soothing voice while backing away.  If you're in a public place where others may be able to help you, yell for help. Often, people on a city street or a parking lot may not realize that you're in trouble unless you make it very obvious. Yell: 'Stop!' or 'Someone help me!' Use your voice to make it clear that you're in trouble and someone may come to your aid.If you're in a more remote location, like a hiking trail or an empty field, try yelling anyway. While you might not be able to see anyone nearby, people may be close enough that they'll be able to tell that something is wrong. If you hike often and are afraid of being attacked, carry a loud whistle. The sound will carry further than your voice alone., The best way to defend against a knife attack is to run. Even if you know martial arts disarming tricks or you are very strong, a knife is still an unpredictable and deadly weapon. Running may seem cowardly, but it is your best chance of survival., If you're attacked by a person with a knife, you should always try to run before fighting. Often, however, you may seem stuck. You may be cornered or your attacker may be blocking your only exit. You'll need to disable your attacker to create an opening to run away., Going for the throat is one of the best ways to disable an attacker. With a hard strike to the throat, you'll damage the person's trachea, disrupting their breathing. They're very likely to stop attacking you after a hard strike to the throat.Get close enough to strike. If your attacker isn't close enough for you to strike at their throat, move in a bit. You'll want to be an arms-width away.  Use your elbow and forearm. The harder the part of your body that you use to strike, the more effective and painful your attack will be. Your elbow is solid bone, and you'll be able to get a lot of power by striking forward with it.  Push through their throat. Using your elbow as your weapon, strike your attacker's throat. Strike as hard and as fast as you can, using the element of surprise to your advantage.  Run. If you've struck your attacker hard enough, they'll lose their ability to breathe. When they double over, run away.  If your attacker is male, a kick to the groin may immediately incapacitate them. Use your knee or shin to strike them in the crotch to create an opening to run. This technique can work with a variety of distances between you and your attacker.If you're close to your attacker, use your knee. A shorter distance between you and the person attacking you means that a knee will be sufficient enough to make a connection. Force your knee hard into their groin.  If they are an arm's length away from you, use your foot or shin. Using your shin is better, because there's more surface area to cause more damage. Extend your knee and snap your leg up into their crotch.  Run. Once your attacker is doubled over or on the ground, run away as fast as possible.  The eyes are an incredibly sensitive part of your body, and any attack focused on the eyes is sure to cause your attacker a lot of pain. Only use this if your attacker is very close, such as in situations where they've grabbed you and have you in a hold. Keep in mind that this technique is extremely dangerous and can be gory, and is only to be used in life or death situations.Extend your fingers to reach their eyes. Most people flinch instantly when they see an attack directed at their eyes, so you'll have to move very quickly. Snap your arm out towards their face in one swift motion.  Press your fingers hard into the eye socket. Simple scratching or light pushing will not be effective. These light attacks will cause pain, but may only further enrage your attacker. You'll need to use your fingers to push hard into the eyes, pressing them into the skull.  Push down. As you push your attackers eyes, press them down towards the base of the skull. Again, this technique is not for the faint of heart, and should only be used in the most dire of circumstances. It can cause blindness and even death.  Run. Once your attacker is incapacitated or unconscious, run away.  If you can’t run and defending yourself is your only option, you will want to do something unpredictable. Spit in your attacker’s face, or drop suddenly to the ground. If you have a backpack or a purse, throw it at their head. If this gives you an opening to run away, do so. If not, you’ll still have thrown them off and given yourself a chance to fight., Being unarmed against a knife attack is a dangerous position to be in. Look around your surroundings for anything that you might use as defense: a metal pipe, a solid tree branch, a chair or a lamp. Anything that puts some distance between you and your attacker is good., When your attacker lunges for you, they will be off balance. If you found your own weapon, now is the time to ram into them. If not, strike out at them to throw them further off with a kick to the groin or the legs. Just make sure to steer clear of the knife., If you are lucky enough to have a weapon to use, strike at the person’s hand, keeping as much space between you and them as possible. This will weaken and damage their hand to the point that they’ll no longer be able to hold the knife.If you don’t have a weapon, you will need to try to grab their wrist and disarm them instead.  While any grab near the knife is incredibly dangerous, grabbing your attacker’s wrist may be your only choice. Grabbing their wrist firmly will give you control of the knife’s direction and give you a moment to punch or strike them., You may be able to wrest the knife from their control, but using both hands to try to take the knife leaves them with an opening to headbutt or punch you instead! Keep them on the defensive by continuing to attack them., If you’re able to, continue to hold their wrist and strike at their head and legs until you can get them on the ground. Once they’re on the ground, continue to keep the knife pointed away from you., If and when you get the upper hand, your attacker may begin to beg for their life. Do not be fooled by this! Most likely, they are trying to get you to lower your guard so that they can attack you again.  Throw it as far away as you can, onto the roof of a building, into the bottom of a dumpster or deep into some woods. This will give you time to get away and prevent your attacker from grabbing the knife easily and coming after you., While online how-tos can give you pointers on how to defend yourself, knife attack are extremely serious and very dangerous. Most flashy moves and practice scenarios are not at all like the real thing, and you’ll need to get serious self defense training before you even think about staying to defend yourself in from a knife attack.  ","stay calm. size up your attacker. ask them what they want. yell for help. run away if possible. make an opening to run. strike at your attacker's throat. kick their groin. go for your attacker's eyes. throw off their guard. try to look for a weapon. wait for them to make a move. try to disarm them. grab their wrist. keep punching or striking. fight them to the ground. don’t feel bad for your attacker. kick or throw away the knife. enroll in self defense courses.

"Making a movie takes a lot of gear, including cameras, microphones, and lights. Take a quick inventory of what you have for equipment, then find ways to fill in the holes:  Cameras: Of course, you could never film a movie without a camera. For most movies, you need at least 2 cameras, and preferably 3. That said, modern camera advancements have made it possible to film a movie with an iPhone 6, so you don't have to drop big bucks anymore. The most important thing for a professional film is to have cameras that shoot in the same format (1080i, for example), otherwise the video quality will change subtly with every cut.  Microphones: If you're in a bind, spend your money on audio equipment: audiences are proven to notice bad sound before bad video. While you can use the attached camera microphones if you must, a Tascam or shotgun mic is always a worthwhile investment.Lighting: If you can get a get great 3-5 piece lighting kit, use it. These lights have a variety of functions and settings that help you light any situation imaginable. However, 5-10 cheap clamp lights and extension cords have lit many an indie film. All you need are lights and different light bulbs (tungsten, frosted, LED, etc.) to customize your scene.Essential Accessories: Depending on the movie, you'll need memory cards, a backup hard drive, tripods, light reflectors, extension cords, black tape (to cover or tape down wires), and computer video editing software., Storyboards look a bit like rough comic books -- you draw the general shot, then add the dialog that needs to be said underneath. You can download templates online easily, then draw them in before a shoot. Storyboards are like checklists while you're filming, helping you capture each shot you need so that, when you're editing, you don't realize suddenly you're missing something.Each frame you draw becomes your shot list -- a detailed book filled with every camera angle you need to capture to tell your story. Once your storyboard is finished, copy it and put it into a binder for later reference.  Make notes of cuts and transitions, and essential sound-effects. These drawings don't have to be art, they have to tell the story of your film visually.These may feel tedious, but they will save you time on set, which quickly gets expensive.  There are many schools of thought about choosing sets, and none of them are wrong. You can build your own sets for ultimate creative control, but this takes time and a lot of money. You can shoot in houses and locations you have easy access too, like your friend's house or backyard. Alternatively, you can rent out spaces that you love, getting the rights to film at a school, hotel, or park. No matter what you do, make sure your set fits your movie, and will allow you and your crew to take over the place for multiple hours, undisturbed.  This may be the moment every filmmaker hates the most, but you need a realistic idea of your film's cost before you start shooting. You do not, for example, want to get halfway through shooting and realize you can't afford to rent a car for the climactic chase scene anymore. Keep your budget simple and realistic. Do you really need 10 prop guns, or can you do with 2? Can you eliminate or change a scene with 100 extras to have 10? You need to budget for:  Equipment that you don't currently own.  Props, costumes, and locations (such as renting out a ballroom or restaurant).  Crew and actor fees. It is possible to get crews and actors for free, but it rare to get people to help for more than 1-2 days without pay.  Food and transportation costs for you, the crew, and the actors.  Know that, for a 'professional' shoot, with paid crew and actors, you should budget, at minimum, $5,000 a day.  You have your characters, your shot list, and the necessary equipment -- now you need someone to use it all. How to cast actors is a personal choice -- you can hold auditions using Craigslist or newspaper posts, visit local theaters, or get your friends involved. As for crew members, there is a variety of posts that you need to fill:  Director of Photography (DP): Arguably the most important job, they are in charge of cameras and lights. While you direct the actors and give the final say on the shot, they handle the technical aspects of the film. You need someone who understands lenses, cameras, and lighting, even if it is just a friend who is into photography. It is very, very hard to effectively light a scene, place, cameras, watch actors, and set the scenery at the same time, so get someone who can take some of the load off you and allow you to direct.  Assistant Director (AD): Schedules the shots, makes sure the shot list is covered, films small scenes if the director is occupied. May help budget as well.  Camera and microphone operators: Self-explanatory, but essential. You can't make a film without them.  Make-up Artist: While anyone can do this, their main job is continuity. Unless a lot of time goes by in your film, you need the actor's face and costumes to look identical in every single scene, otherwise the audience will notice the changes. Take pictures every day of the costume, make-up and scenes to make sure it looks the same.  Sound Engineer: Listen to all the sound as it is being recorded, ensuring that it is right. They also place the microphones to pick up dialog after the lights have been placed.  Line Producer: Checks out locations ahead of time, makes sure permits and contracts are written and signed.  Production Assistant: Always useful, these people do whatever needs to be done-- preparing food and coffee, wiping memory cards, and even holding a camera when needed. You can never have enough crew members.  It doesn't matter who you are working with or what the project is -- get a contract signed. This protects you in the case of accidents, legally obligates people to see your movie through to completion, and prevents lawsuits in case the movie gets picked up. You can search online for 'Actor Film Contract,' 'Producer Contract,' etc. and tailor it to your needs easily and freely, so don't skimp out on this step.Contracts are, paradoxically, a great way to preserve friendships. Instead of arguing over something later, you can simply return to what you already have in writing.  Make sure to have a provision, especially for actors, that requires them to finish the film once they begin shooting.  Realistically, unless you only have a few people in your script and 1-2 locations you're only going to get 5-10 pages of your script done in a good day. For big or difficult scenes, you may only get 2-3 pages. The more time you can spend filming the better, but the more time spent filming the more money you will spend as well. How you balance this depends on a few factors:  What scenes all take place at the same location? Can you film them, even if they are out of order, on the same day?  What scenes have massive shot lists? Getting these done first can ensure you get the 'big' scenes the way you want them.  Are any shots expendable if time/money is running short? Put these last.  This schedule may, and likely will, have to be fluid. But the more you can stick to it, the better.  ","make a list of all of your equipment and equipment needs. make a storyboard for each scene. find your sets and locations. use your storyboard and equipment list to make your budget. hire actors and crew members. sign contracts. make your filming schedule.

"The chemotherapy is the initial part of this treatment, and it must be followed up by a stem cell transplant, which is what these cells that are frozen will be used for down the road.  You will likely receive a medication such as G-CSF (Granulating Colony Stimulating Factor) which will promote the growth of white blood cells, that can subsequently be removed and frozen.  After this preparation stage is complete, you will be ready to move forward with chemotherapy.;  , Therefore, using chemotherapy to target and 'kill off' your white blood cells, including your T cells, can be used as a method to get rid of the cells that are at the root of the problem in MS. It is this concept that has made the idea of chemotherapy for MS potentially so promising (although it is still in the early stages so doctors have yet to see ongoing proof of its effectiveness).  Chemotherapy agents that are typically used include a combination of Etoposide, Cytarabine, Carmustine, and Melphalan, as well as an immunosuppressive agent called Thymoglobulin. The chemotherapy regimen is called 'BEAM.'  Although chemotherapy does not technically cure MS, 18 out of 19 patients in the initial study showed either a stabilization or an improvement of their disease following treatment - so it is certainly a promising option for those who meet the eligibility requirements., However, you will be required to continue with ongoing monitoring for approximately 2 months following chemotherapy treatment for MS.  In the initial 2-month period following chemotherapy, doctors will check your cell counts and overall response to treatment to ensure that there are no complications.  You will also be asked to follow up with 8 study visits over the course of the following 5 years. At these visits, doctors will examine your blood and your urine, they may do an MRI, and they will perform a neurological exam to assess your MS symptoms (and to note the hopeful improvement of your symptoms since receiving treatment).  These follow up visits serve to inform you about your progress, as well as to provide the data needed for the study to determine the long-term efficacy of MS chemotherapy treatment.  This is the final stage of treatment. The hope is that the chemotherapy will have eliminated all of the damaging T cells from your white blood cell line that were responsible for the autoimmune damage of multiple sclerosis. The goal now is to replace the cells that were destroyed with healthy new cells (the ones that were frozen and will now be transplanted).  When the cells were frozen, the doctors will have removed the T cells, and frozen only healthy cells to be transplanted back into you following chemotherapy. This is what makes the treatment so effective and so promising.  You will remain in hospital following the stem cell transplant until your 'peripheral cell counts' (your white blood cell counts) have returned to the normal range., It is generally not used to treat mild cases of MS, due to the lack of evidence and the potential risks. If you have a severe progressive form of MS, or one with multiple relapses, this treatment may be for you.  If your form of MS qualifies for potential chemotherapy treatment, your doctor will also need to evaluate your overall health and fitness to receive the treatment.  If you have a number of other medical illnesses, you may not be eligible. However, if your body is strong and healthy, you may be eligible to participate in the clinical trial and to receive chemotherapy as a treatment for your MS.  It is important to understand that chemotherapy as a treatment for MS is still in the clinical trial phase.What this means is that it is a new treatment that has only recently been tried by the medical community, and it lacks substantial long-term evidence of its effectiveness.  Normally, you would speak to your doctor to determine your eligibility to enter the clinical trial and, if you qualified, he or she would put you in contact with the physicians administering the trial.  Unfortunately, the clinical trial for MS chemotherapy is not currently accepting new patients.It may or may not open again down the road for new patients.  If chemotherapy treatment remains of interest to you, continue to follow up with your doctor about the status of the clinical trial to see if any new spots open down the road.  However, there have been a few case reports of people who have died from the treatment. Also, there is no long-term evidence yet as to potential implications of the treatment on your health and wellbeing down the road. It is important to be aware of the risks prior to signing up for this novel treatment.  If your condition is severe enough (i.e. if you are suffering a lot from your symptoms of MS), the benefits of trying the treatment will likely outweigh the cons.  However, it is up to you to weigh the pros and cons and to determine which choice is right with you. Your doctor can provide guidance and assistance with this decision.  Whether or not the progression is able to be slowed depends on two factors:  The stage at which 'disease-modifying treatment' is initiated (the earlier, the better), and  The specific type of MS you have. The 'relapsing-remitting' type tends to be the one which responds best to disease-modifying treatment, which in turn can slow the rate at which it progresses.  Examples of steroid medications include Prednisone and IV (intravenous) Methylprednisolone. The purpose of steroid therapy is to reduce the inflammation around the nerves, as it is an autoimmune attack of the nerves that leads to the symptoms of MS to begin with.  'Another option, if steroid therapy does not help you, is plasma exchange (called 'plasmapheresis'). This is when a portion of your blood (the plasma) is removed and exchanged with new plasma. The goal is that, in the exchange, the autoimmune antibodies (leading to the symptoms of MS) can be temporarily cleared from your body.  Many of these symptoms can be improved with specific medical treatment.  slow) the progression of the disease itself is to opt for disease-modifying therapies. These are most successful for the relapsing-remitting form of MS. They have unfortunately shown little utility in the other forms of MS.  Treatment options include Beta interferons, Dimethyl fumarate, Teriflunomide, Natalizumab, Glatiramer acetate, Fingolimod, Mitoxantrone, and Alemtuzumab.  These treatments may have significant side effects, so it is important to discuss the pros and cons with your physician prior to initiating treatment.  ","stimulate the growth of white blood cells in your bone marrow.the first thing you will need to do in order to treat ms via chemotherapy is to stimulate the growth of white blood cells so that a large enough sample can be removed from your body and stored (frozen) for use later on. receive chemotherapy for your ms.chemotherapy is traditionally thought of as a treatment for cancer only; however, it is also effective in destroying white blood cells, and it is a certain lineage of white blood cells (called your t cells) that are responsible for the autoimmune damage in multiple sclerosis. continue with regular monitoring following the chemotherapy.your cell counts will typically return to normal 9-14 days following the treatment. have the stem cell transplant.once your white blood cells have been wiped out with chemotherapy, you are now ready to receive the autologous (meaning using your own cells) stem cell transplant. determine whether you are a candidate for chemotherapy.in order to be a candidate to receive chemotherapy treatment for your ms, you need to have a form of ms with a poor prognosis (meaning a poor outlook moving forwards). talk to your doctor about how to sign up for an ms clinical trial. factor in the risks of ms chemotherapy treatment.over 90% of people who have received this treatment to date have suffered no serious complications from it. learn about the various ms treatment options that are available, apart from chemotherapy.while ms cannot be cured (and medical researchers are still actively looking into the question of how best to treat it), there are several options available to treat and improve symptoms and, in some cases, to actually slow the progression of ms as well. consider steroid treatment.regardless of which type of ms you have, and how early or late it is in the course of your disease, virtually all ms patients are offered steroids as a form of treatment. opt for 'plasma exchange. ask your doctor about treatments for symptom management.common symptoms of ms include fatigue, trouble with bladder control, muscle stiffness and/or spasms, sensations of numbness and/or tingling, vision problems, trouble walking, problems with balance and/or coordination, and decreased cognitive function (problems with thinking, learning, and planning). try specific 'disease-modifying' therapies.as previously mentioned, the only way to actually alter (i.e. "
"First, press a lump of red clay flat. Then use your hands or even a rolling pin to roll the clay out until it’s very thin. For each poppy that you want to make, punch out ten circles with a circular cookie cutter. Once you’re done, press your finger along the edges of each one to soften and thin them.Pressing the edges down may cause the circles to stick to your worktable. Use any thin tool that you have handy to scrape them off as needed.;  , For each circle, choose one edge to be your top and its opposite to be your bottom. Run the ball end of a medium-size stylus from the center of the bottom toward the top to create a slightly depressed line running straight up the middle. Repeat several times on both sides of the first line, with each line fanning outward from the bottom of the center line toward the circle’s edges.You don’t need to start each line in the exact center of the circle’s bottom edge, but the bottoms of your lines should be grouped close together toward the center and then spread outward from there.  Ball up the clay left over from punching out your petals and roll it out again, as thin as before. Your base should be thicker than your petals, however, so either fold the sheet in half to create a double layer, or trim two squares from it and press them together. Punch out a circle for your base with a cookie cutter.Of course, if your original sheet of rolled clay has enough left for two squares, don’t worry about balling it up and rolling it out again.  First, press the ball of a fatter stylus into the center of your base to create a bowl effect. Apply gentle pressure to avoid flattening the whole thing. Use your fingers to smooth and fix the edges afterward if they appear uneven.Repeat if desired for an even deeper bowl. Just be sure not to break through the bottom of the bowl. You want to keep that intact.  Lay a headpin flat across one rim of your bowl. Line up the head of the pin with the center of the bowl. Once the pin’s head is centered, gently press the body of the pin through the rim. Work slowly so the pin remains perfectly horizontal as it goes down. Stop once the pin’s head comes to a rest at the bottom of your bowl, about halfway down the base, depending on how deep you made your bowl.As before, be careful not to push the pin all the way through your base. You want to keep the bottom of your bowl intact for the next step.  Take a strip of clay from your flattened sheet. Lay it over the rim of your bowl where the body of the pin cut through it. Use your stylus to lightly press the strip into the clay and reshape the rim as needed.Then, once the body of the pin has been secured in the rim, dab some clear liquid clay into the bowl to keep the head in place.  Set five of them aside for later. With the remaining five, place the bottom of one petal along the inner rim of your base’s bowl. Use your stylus to smooth the petal’s bottom into the rim itself until the two clays join. Then add a second petal in the same fashion. With this one, however, line the bottom up so half of it is covering where you just attached the first petal.Repeat with each petal, using each one to cover about half of the previous petal.  By the time you’re done layering all the petals over each other, the bowl and hairpin should be covered and hidden from view.  Notice how your petals are still relatively flat. Give them some more life by reshaping them. Gently place the ball of one stylus on the upper side of a petal. Now do the same underneath the petal, a little farther along its edge. Gently manipulate your styluses to slightly twist the petal’s edge as you please.Use the same technique with each petal. At the same time, try not to shape each one exactly the same. You want to suggest natural growth and movement, so try to avoid a uniform look.  Go over all five petals as many times as it takes until you’re satisfied with your sculpted flower.  A flower’s “peduncle” is the base from which the petals grow. Use your fingers to shape a ball of green clay that’s small enough to fit in the very center of your flower where the bottoms of your petals overlap. Then flatten the peduncle’s bottom on your worktable so it’s dome-shaped. Press your thinnest stylus into the center of the dome’s top. Now use your stylus to draw lines from the center, down its sides, to the bottom, all the way around the dome, so it resembles a buncake.Once you’ve drawn your lines, roughen the texture by lightly brushing a toothbrush over the surface.  If your toothbrush smooths out one of your lines by accident, just go over it again with your stylus to correct it.  Dab some liquid clay in the center of your flower. Set the peduncle in place. Apply just the slightest pressure to help it set into the liquid.Once it’s in place, use the same stylus as before to reshape any lines that might have smoothed out while being handled.  If necessary, go over it again with your toothbrush as well.  First, trace a thin line around the edges of the peduncle. Secure it that much more to your flower. Then add lines of liquid clay from the peduncles’ edges straight up along the petals.Remember: you’re trying to replicate nature, so try not to be too orderly about drawing lines.  Avoid patterns (like one short, one long, one short, one long, etc.) or drawing two side-by-side lines that look exactly the same.  When it’s finished, there shouldn’t be any open space between the lines radiating out from the peduncle.  Harden what you have so you can move on to the flower’s back without wrecking its front. Heat your oven to 130 degrees Celsius (266 Fahrenheit). Once it’s ready, set your flower on a baking sheet and bake for ten minutes. However, always check the directions of your particular brand of clay first. If the manufacturer advises a lower temperature, follow their instructions.Polymer clay is safe to bake in a home oven, as long as you don’t burn it. If it burns, it may start to release toxic fumes.To be extra safe, use an oven thermometer to confirm that your oven doesn’t heat higher than the temperature you set it to.  A baking sheet is probably very easy to clean, but to be extra safe, devote one exclusively for clay. Don’t reuse it for cooking.  After your clay is done baking, let your flower cool off before handling it again. Once it’s cool enough to touch, brush liquid clay along the back of the base. Use fresh red clay to form a thin disk that’s a little smaller than the flower’s base. Press this into the liquid clay.Once your disk is attached to the back of the base, add your remaining five petals to the fresh clay. Use the same technique as before. Smooth the bottom of each petal into the clay. Use each petal to cover half of the previous one. Then use your styluses to twist your petals’ edges for a more natural, random effect.  A flower's sepal is a leaf-like growth that cups the back of the flower. Roll out a thin sheet of green clay. Use your stylus to trace outline for a sepal to add to the back of your flower (these resemble a bikini shape), and then cut it out with a sculpting knife. Run your stylus down the center of each one of its three offshoots. Then use your thinnest stylus to draw veins from the center line out to the edges of each side.Once you’re done, place one sepal over the back’s center, using your fingers or stylus to gently press it into the new petals so their clays join.  Go over your sepal’s lines with your thin stylus again to sharpen them if they smoothed out while you pressed.  Return the clay to the oven to bake for another 15 to 20 minutes. Remove it and let it cool off again. To add even more detail in and around the peduncle, apply brown or black acrylic paint with a fine brush along its lines, as well as the surrounding lines of dried liquid clay.Once the paint dries, brush the whole thing with sculptor’s glaze for a shiny finish, if you like.

"Although illness is relatively uncommon, crabs can get sick. This is usually related to problems with their habitat, or “crabitat,” but may be a result of other issues such as mites., Hermit crabs need access to water to keep their skin moist and healthy. Examining your crab for signs of dry skin can keep your crab from drying out and ensure it can breathe properly.Signs of dry skin in hermit crabs can include:  Lack of water in the tank or on a sponge  Matte appearance to the skin  Excessive burrowing to get at moist spots in the tank  , The environment in the tank is vital to a hermit crab’s health and promotes its movement, too. If your hermit crab isn’t moving around much, the water in its habitat or even toxic paint on its shell could be killing it.Lethargy can also be a sign of stress.Recognize that most hermit crabs like to play and will move around their habitats a lot if they are not molting or sick.  Make sure your hermit crab is moving regularly and not hanging out of its shell, which can be a signal that it is dying.  Remember that lack of movement can also signal molting., Foul odor coming from the tank can signal illnesses related to problems with the habitat. Check on your crabs every day, which can quickly signal you to any bad smells that might be coming from the animals or parts of the tank.  Be aware that there may be a broad range of odors that can signal problems. These include: stinky feet, fish or shrimp, mildew or must, rotting food.  Mites are arguably the most common cause of health issues for hermit crabs and you should be especially vigilant in checking for these.Be aware that there are “good” and harmless mites that inhabit crab’s spaces and bodies but that there are also “bad” and harmful mites.Watch out for the following types of harmful mites:  Gill mites, which are light pink or red and bury into the gills of hermit crabs. These mites are often not visible until after a hermit crab’s death because a flap of skin protects the gills of live animals.  Crab mites, which glue themselves to soft parts of hermit crabs’ bodies including the eyes, mouth, or joints. Crab mites range in color from white to cream, grey, pink, or red., In addition to the physical symptoms of illness, hermit crabs may also exhibit unusual behaviors.Checking on your crabs daily will help you see each animals typical behavior—hermit crabs do have distinct personalities-- and can alert you to potential problems.Some behavioral problems to watch out for are:  Digging down into the habitat sand or coconut fiber to “de-stress”  Consuming large amounts of food or water  Soaking in the water dish  Being very lethargic.Hiding in its shell for long periods, especially if it usually enjoys attention.Molting in the open.Hanging out of its shell in a limp or lifeless manner., Sickness is rare among hermit and other types of crabs.However, there can be some confusion when trying to tell if your hermit crab is sick because many of the symptoms of illness parallel the signs of molting such as missing limbs and burrowing for days or months.Some additional signs that your hermit crab may be molting and not sick, especially if the crab exhibits several of these symptoms, are:  Digging  Drinking large amounts of water or soaking in the dish  Spilling water from the dish to dampen the sand or coconut fiber in the tank  Cloudy eyes  Ashy-looking skin, which is also called the exoskeleton  Lethargy., Crabs must molt their skin to grow and this process can take weeks or months.If you realize your hermit crab is molting, leave it alone because she may be very fragile and any type of contact can cause her undue stress.Be aware that healthy crabs will molt “in private” by burrowing or hiding in a dark spot of the tank.The crab may not eat during molting, either.  Leave the molting or molted skin on the crab. She will eat the skin for calcium once she’s done molting., In most cases, you should avoid touching your hermit crab in any way. This can cause them undue stress and may kill it, especially if the crab is molting.Stay away from blowing on or poking your crab, which can also stress your pet.Be aware that there is varying information on touching crabs, but that not handling them with care can result in bites., If you suspect one of your crabs is sick, especially with mites, you’ll need to separate it from its crab friends. Prepare a large bucket or other container in which to isolate and treat your hermit crab.  Make sure that the isolation tank is similar to your crab’s normal habitat. Add some dechlorinated water, sand or coconut fiber, toys, and food in the crabitat.  Observe your sick crab to make sure it is healing. Once it appears healthy again, move it back to the regular tank.  Avoid isolating molting crabs as this can kill them. Remember to leave them alone in their usual habitat.Move a crab that is hanging out of its shell limply to an isolation tank. This is a sign that the crab may be dying., Many illnesses that crabs develop are a result of problems with the water or its habitat. Changing the water regularly key to healing and maintaining your hermit crab’s health.Add new water to the tank as you see it evaporating.  Change the water if you notice an ammonia smell or murky water. Remember to use dechlorinated and brackish water.Never use table salt to make brackish water.  Place new sand and toys in the habitat. You can also clean toys with a mild soap and water and rinse it thoroughly.  Although there are differing viewpoints on the treatment of bad mites on your hermit crab, there are a couple of different ways to kill them.You can either bathe your hermit crab or introduce a mite species that will eat the bad mites from your pet.bath with care if you choose to use this method. Use dechlorinated, tepid water and lower him into a container you’re using as a bath. Your crab may go into the water alone, too.Don’t leave your crab unattended and remove it from the water after about a minute.Drain any excess water from the shell and allow your crab to dry out in a box or on a paper towel.Put the crab back in its usual habitat once it is dry.Introduce the predatory mite Hypoaspis miles into a habitat infested with bad mites. The Hypoaspis miles will eat all of the other mites, larvae, and eggs without bothering your crabs. As the number of bad mites disappears, so will the number of Hypoaspis miles., Consider taking your hermit crab to the vet if no other treatments are working or you don’t feel comfortable. However, you should be aware that there is little a vet can do for a very sick or dying hermit crab and nature may need to simply take its course.Call your vet’s office to make sure they will see hermit crabs.  Consider your crab’s health. If it really is dying, moving it to go to the vet can cause it unnecessary stress.

"Do your shoulders get tense? Do you start to breathe rapidly, or notice a sour taste in your mouth? If your stomach feels tight, or your palms start to shake or sweat, you're likely feeling stress.By learning to recognize the signs of becoming stressed, you can more easily connect the feeling with its source.  The sooner you start to notice signs of stress or tension, the more rapidly you can take steps to remove yourself from the situation or calm down.;  , Is there a certain person, situation, or environment that's causing you to feel stressed out? An important tool in learning to handle your stress is to find out more about what's causing it. Sometimes it will be easy to identify one cause, and other times you might find that your stress is the result of a combination of stressors.Common sources of stress at school include homework, grades, sleep deprivation, packed schedules, peer pressure, and bullying.If you are being bullied, talk to your parents, your teachers, or a school counselor to get help.Identifying your stressors is the first step in defining your situation as manageable. If you feel like you can find a solution, this in itself should decrease your feelings of stress.  Try to avoid judging yourself as wrong or bad for feeling stressed. When you locate the source of the stress, keep an objective attitude. Tell yourself, 'I'm feeling stressed right now. That's a natural response. I am not my stress.'  , Taking deep breaths from the diaphragm triggers the relaxation response in your body, which comes from the parasympathetic nervous system. Taking in air through the nose, breathing all the way down to the belly, and allowing breath to escape slowly through the mouth will help you calm down in a stressful situation.It might help to raise, lower and roll your shoulders, or gently turn your neck. Your body often holds these muscles tense when you're feeling stressed. By relaxing these muscles you're also decreasing your feelings of stress.  Taking deep breaths before entering a stressful situation can help you stay relaxed and focused.  If you don't know how to respond to a stressful situation, find someone to help you. If you're at school, you might ask a teacher, a counselor, or a peer for help. If it's a problem that you need help with right away, talk to someone in your classroom or ask for permission to talk to someone in another part of the building. If it's a long-term problem, consider asking your parent, your teacher, or a counselor for help.Everyone has to ask for help at times. Asking for help doesn't mean you're not independent or intelligent. In fact, it's a sign of genuine intelligence to recognize your limitations.  When you ask for help, include as much information as you can about how you've identified the problem, and things you've tried to make the problem better.  Sometimes feeling overwhelmed in a stressful situation results in rapid, or 'racing', thoughts. If this happens to you, try a strategy called 'thought-stopping.' This means what it sounds like: interrupt your thoughts, stop, or 'park' them out of your immediate attention, and temporarily turn your attention to something else for a while.  You might try saying (either out loud or to yourself): 'That's enough of those thoughts for now. I will get busy (doing something else) and come back to this after lunch.'  This strategy is also known as 'adaptive distancing'.  If you're unable to cope with a particular situation, person, or place, one method of handling it is to leave. Physically removing yourself from a situation provides relief from stress and worry.  You can take a break by taking a walk outside, going to the bathroom (always an option for taking a private moment), or something else. You might invent a story about forgetting something in your car, which will give you a reason to leave the immediate situation and walk outside.  Having favorite, safe, places in your school setting will be helpful. For example, if you feel better in quiet spaces, go visit the library when you're feeling stressed.  There are times when this is not appropriate. For example, you should not leave an exam or presentation in the middle of it. However, you could decide to leave the situation if, for example, you are having a conversation with someone that is stressing you out. Try saying something like, 'I'm feeling a little overwhelmed right now. I'm going to take a little break, okay?'  ","get to know the way your body experiences stress. identify the source of your stress. take 3 deep breaths. ask for help. practice thought-stopping. move away from the situation if you can. "
"It’s very important that you not rub, scrub or scrape too hard or you might scratch the car exterior. However, you should still do some prepping of the car.  Pull as much of the gum off as you can before applying any products to it.Move the car into a shaded area so that the gum doesn’t melt while you’re working on it.;  , It might be a good idea to wipe the area of the car where the gum is stuck to remove any obvious dirt.  All you need is a bucket full of hot water and dish soap. You just need a squirt of dish soap in two cups of water. Dip a cloth into the bucket, and wet it. Then, gently wipe away any easily removable residue from the car’s exterior.You want to avoid using anything too abrasive. It’s best to use a soft cloth when rubbing on a car exterior.  You will want to repeat this process after you remove the gum too to get rid of any lingering residue. After removing the gum, you may need to apply a new coat of protective wax.  If the water is hot enough, it may be possible to remove the gum using only soap and water.  Take a cotton ball, soak it in body solvent, and let it sit on the gum for about a minute to soften it up. Then, take a soft cloth with body solvent on it. Wipe it off.  You may need to repeat the process a second time if it doesn’t all come off.Body solvents are specifically designed to be used on paint, so they are a good choice for cleaning a car exterior without damage.  You can also try this with rubbing alcohol.  If you wet the gum with bug remover and tar remover, it should come right off the car. You might need to wax the car after you use this, though, as it can remove some of the wax.  The good thing about bug and tar remover is that it’s designed specifically not to harm a car exterior because people usually use it to get rid of bugs that have flown into the car’s outside or tar that’s ended up on the vehicle. You could also apply the bug and tar remover to the gum by using a soft cloth. Rub the remover into the gum, until it starts to come off.  Goo Gone is one product that is widely used to remove gum from car exteriors. Goof Off also has a product that can be used on car paint.Goo Gone advertises that its product is safe for use on a car exterior if you follow the instructions for hard surfaces.To use either product, apply the product and wait three to five minutes. Pull the gum off. Use a clean cloth to wipe off excess gum.Wear safety goggles and solvent-resistant gloves when working with chemicals.  Believe it or not, there is a product designed to remove gum. It’s often used by industrial cleaners, so look for it in such a store.  Spray the remover on the gum, and then remove the gum from the car.  Some people also use WD-40 oil to remove gum, bugs, and other grime from a car exterior., Spraying compressed air on the gum ma harden it enough for you to remove the wad. This method is usually very effective.  You can find these cans in most hardware stores.  Usually, people use compressed air to clean other things, such as removing residue caught inside a computer keyboard. However, they work on a car exterior too.  You might be able to peel the gum off the car exterior if you harden it. You can do this with ice cubes.  Take a small towel and wrap the ice cubes in it. Hold it on the gum for about five minutes. Once you remove it, the gum should be hard.  Try to gently peel off the hard gum. You may need to repeat the process. You could also put the ice cube in a Ziploc bag. Wrapping it will keep it from dripping too much once it starts to melt.  The oil in the peanut butter can help remove the gum from your car. It’s not designed to clean your car, but some people still use it, and they say it can work.Smear the peanut butter on the gum. Let it sit for three minutes, and then wipe it off with a damp rag. Peanut butter causes the chewing gum to lose its stickiness, and it becomes easier to pick out.  You could also try putting body oil on the gum with the same principle in mind. Some people have also tried using eucalyptus oil with some success.  ","prepare your car before trying to remove the gum. clean the spot around the gum. try body solvent. spray the gum with bug and tar remover. purchase a commercial product designed to remove grime. purchase gum remover. try a can of compressed air. use ice to harden the gum. use peanut butter.

"Practice is very important in order to improve your batting. Make sure to practice regularly, even if it is for a short interval, even half an hour. The more you practice, better your play will be.  An unplanned practice session helps in nothing but tiredness. Keep everything preplanned to help you out while practice session.  You can get a coach to help you on improving your batting skills. But remember, no one can teach you anything before you put your own efforts in your game. ;  , You should know your weaknesses and strengths and try to bat as much as possible to turn them into a strength. It is always better to have no weak points instead of having a few strengths. Work on balls which you feel hard to face or part of the ground where you mostly get out., It is vital to believe that you can bat well. For this, you need to be passionate about cricket. Confidence comes with practice. The more you practice, better you will know about your game. Keep yourself motivated during games. Congratulate yourself on every single run.  Don't stick to a particular shot. Different balls need to be angled differently. You can practice a shot to master it, but should not make the same response on every ball. If you play a particular shot on a couple of balls, the bowler may realize that it is your strong zone and would avoid you bowling there.  Try to set your goals such as 'Scoring 25 runs; playing yorkers'. Through this, you will increase your potential and more accurately come to know your capability. Start from small targets and then increase your levels step by step.  Play unofficial games. Play some pick-up games among friends that involve batting, but not necessarily in a true game. This would help you to increase your enthusiasm for batting and improve your skills at the same time.  You will come to know about handling pressure and play under tense circumstances.  Know your role. Find out what team wants from you and what position do you play in. Sometimes your team expects very much from you, but you do not know what you have to do when you go in.  Interact with your teammates. Attend team meetings and discuss strategies. An effective communication will help your teammates play well as a unit.  Guess what could be the next ball from the bowler. If you know the tricks and the bowling speed of the bowler, you can decide your shots and adjust your timing.  Nothing can be done once the ball is delivered. You have to guess right from the run-up.  Place yourself in the bowler's position. Guess what you would have done if you were at the other end. This will help you guess and respond accordingly.  Learn different tricks like playing the hook shots and playing drives. Always try to play from the middle of the bat, called the sweet spot.  Try to watch more and more matches and observe the strategies, then apply them in your own game.  Follow one of your favorite cricketers. Notice their style of playing and adapt those styles in your own game.  If you can't achieve your goal, don't lose confidence. Every player has variations in capabilities and talent; some players don't achieve their goal even after many tries. The key is to not give up and keep practicing.  Most importantly, you should love and enjoy the game. Play with a cool mind ;accept defeats and take them as a challenge and move on. Be fair and respect other players and your teammates, too. No one wants his/her team to lose the game.  ","practice. focus on your weak points. believe in yourself. play a variety of shots and strokes. set goals. guess bowling strategies. become well-versed in the tricks. watch matches played all the way out. avoid being disappointed. enjoy your game.

"Use this phrase if someone does something nice for you. Also say it if you’re given something. Add the word большое (bal-SHO-ye) if you want to say “thank you very much.” The full phrase is спасибо большое (spAH-see-ba bal-SHO-ye)., Respond to спасибо with пожалуйста. This word is always appropriate and appreciated. Note that пожалуйста also means “please” if you’re asking someone to do something. For example, use it as “please” if you’re asking someone to give you something or tell you directions., Run it together so it sounds like one word. Use this instead of пожалуйста in informal situations. Only use it with people you know., For example, you’ll only use “I’m sorry” if you’re really broken up about wronging someone. Note that both of these phrases have formal and informal forms.Use the polite form извините (eez-vee-nEEt-ye) or the informal извини (eez-vee-nEE) for “excuse me.”  Tell someone “I’m sorry” using простите (pra-stEEt-ye) for the formal or прости (pra-stEE) for the informal.  Never ask it with someone in authority. This can be considered rude.  Expect a response like хорошо (kha-ra-shOH) for “good.”  Both нормально (nor-mAHl-na) and так себя (tahk sib-YA) mean “okay.”  Ask “how are you?” formally with the phrase как живете (kahk zhee-vyOHt-ye)?.

"Open and honest communication is the most important aspect of a healthy relationship, and is the key to building trust. Without proper communication, simple misunderstandings can turn into full-fledged fights. Keep your relationship strong and avoid excessive arguing by simply expressing yourself on a regular basis.  Discuss issues as they come up rather than bottling them up and growing resentful over time.  Learn how to be diplomatic during arguments. Try not to get overly defensive if your wife is being critical of you. Similarly, try not to sound accusatory or angry when bringing up issues with her.  Listen to her. Being a good communicator isn’t just about knowing how to talk. It’s important to give your wife your undivided attention when she is speaking. Look her in the eyes, ask her questions, and don’t look at your telephone or computer screen if she’s speaking about something important.  If you are in a bad mood for any reason, then tell her explicitly rather than ignoring her or being short with her. This way, she can give you the space you need without taking your attitude personally.  A healthy relationship is a two-way street. Over the course of your marriage, you will inevitably have to give up certain things to make her happy, and vice versa. If one of you is constantly giving in to the other’s demands without any reciprocation, there will likely be some resentment down the road.  In any long-term relationship, it’s natural for one or both parties to need some alone time to unwind and focus on themselves. There’s nothing wrong with needing time away, but it’s important to be vocal about it and assure her that she shouldn't take it personally.  Designate one 'free' day out of the week or month during which you can do your own thing, and let her do the same. If you have children, take turns watching them while the other one is out.  Never lie to your wife to avoid having to spend time with her. If she really loves you, she will understand if you need to be alone or spend a night out with the guys.  Studies have shown that the average woman spends 10 more hours each week doing housework than her husband does!Excessive housework and other stress-inducing activities can attribute to decreased sexual desire in both men and women. Help balance out the workload by doing dishes, vacuuming, cleaning the bathrooms, doing yard work, handling repairs, and so on.  The key is to help out around the house even when you have not explicitly been asked to do so. Remember that it is as much your obligation as it is your wife’s to keep the house clean and in shape.  If you have children, help your wife by offering to pick the kids up from school, watch them when she is busy, etc.  Some people are more comfortable living in a messy environment than others. To insure that you both feel comfortable in your own home, make sure that your house meets the standards of whoever is most nit-picky about cleanliness.  Just because you’re okay with extra dishes sitting in the sink overnight, your wife may not be, and you should respect that. If your wife is the messy one, then gently remind her every once in a while to clean up her surroundings.  Even your schedule doesn’t leave extra time to do chores around the house, there’s no excuse to not clean up your own messes. The least you can do is wash your own dishes, put your clothes away, and take care of your own laundry.  If you are too busy during the week, then devote an hour or two each weekend to cooking, cleaning, and/or doing yard work.  Living with another person means letting down your guard and seeing each other’s less attractive sides. While this level of comfort is a true sign of intimacy, it can also damage the level of sexual attraction you feel for each other in the long run.  Maintain your personal hygiene, be respectful when it comes to bathroom etiquette, and make an effort to stay in shape.  Getting regular skin-on-skin contact releases a chemical called oxytocin, which reduces stress and increases feelings of intimacy in the long-run.Physical contact doesn’t necessarily mean sex. Kiss her goodbye every time you part ways, hug her when you see each other again, and cozy up in front of a good movie.  Every marriage has its ups and downs, and the only way to make it through difficult times is to maintain a sense of humor and be silly every once in a while. You don’t have to be a stand-up comedian, but you should make an effort to put a smile on her (and your) face every day.  Get tickets to a live comedy show, host game nights with friends, or play sports together; anything to get the laughter going!  Getting regular laughter will not only improve your marriage, it can actually improve your health by lowering your blood pressure, increasing oxygen flow to the brain, and reducing stress levels., Just because you’ve put a ring in her finger, doesn’t mean you should stop trying to win her affection. Every once in a while, make the same sweet romantic gestures that you did in the beginning of the relationship. Bring her flowers, get tickets to her favorite show, or plan a surprise romantic evening.  ","learn how to communicate. be willing to compromise. take time apart when necessary. help out around the house. respect her standards for cleanliness. pick up after yourself. keep some mystery intact. get daily physical contact. laugh together. surprise her.

"This illness affects each area of the gastrointestinal tract. Its symptoms can include nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, and general malaise. Keep in mind that these symptoms can occur from a low grade fever instead, such as one caused by the influenza virus (the 'actual flu,' unrelated to the stomach flu).  The stomach flu is self-limited, meaning the symptoms usually end in 2-3 days, but can last up to 10 days.There is no cure, so focus on preventing it from spreading and making yourself as comfortable as possible while the virus runs its course.;  , The virus is spread by coming in contact with contaminated food, water, utensils, and other objects such as doorknobs that an infected person has touched.  Have you come into contact with someone who has the stomach flu? Do you have any of the symptoms of the stomach flu? If your symptoms are mild-moderate nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, you most likely have a garden variety stomach flu caused by the three most common viral pathogens: norovirus, rotavirus, or adenovirus.  In most cases, you do not need medical care to recover from these viruses.  This is especially important if your symptoms don't lessen over time. Call a doctor or visit a clinic if you're experiencing the following symptoms:  Increased or constant vomiting for more than a day  Fever over 101 °F (38 °C)  Diarrhea for more than two days  Weight loss  Decreased urine production  Confusion  Weakness, If you experience any of the following symptoms, you may have severe dehydration or another serious medical condition. Visit an emergency room or call for emergency services immediately:  Fever higher than 103 °F (39 °C)  Confusion  Sluggishness (lethargy)  Seizures  Difficulty breathing  Chest or abdominal pains  Fainting  Blood in vomit or stool  No urine in the last 12 hoursFeeling faint or lightheaded, especially upon standing  A racing pulse  Severe or localized abdominal pain (this could indicate appendicitis or pancreatitis)  , Infants and toddlers are at an increased risk complications such as of dehydration as are diabetics, the elderly or those with HIV.Babies and children are at a higher risk of severe dehydration than adults. If you suspect that your child is suffering from dehydration, seek help immediately. Some common symptoms include:  No wet diapers for 5 or 6 hours  Sunken spot at the top of the skull (fontanel)  Dark urine  Drier-than-usual mouth and eyes  A lack of tears during cryingSkin tenting (if you pinch the skin, it holds the shape)  , Wash your hands a lot. Prevent the flu from spreading through your household by washing your hands repeatedly. Studies show that you should use regular soap (there is no need for antibacterial soap) and warm water for between 15-30 seconds to wash your hands in order to be highly effective.Don't touch people if you don't have to. Avoid unnecessary hugs, kisses, or handshakes.  Try not to handle frequently-touched surfaces such as doorknobs, toilet handles, faucet handles, or kitchen cabinet handles. Cover your hand with the sleeve of your shirt, or put a tissue over your hand first.  Sneeze or cough into your elbow. Bend your arm at the elbow and bring it up to your face so that your nose and mouth are in the crook of your arm. This will prevent germs from getting on your hand, where they're more likely to be spread around.  Wash your hands or use hand sanitizer frequently. If you've recently thrown up, sneezed, or handled any other bodily fluid, sanitize your hands.  Children should be kept out of school and childcare to prevent the spread of infection. Those affected with Acute gastroenteritis (AGE) are shedding bacteria in their feces for as long as they have diarrhea, so until that stops, they should be kept away from others. When diarrhea stops the child is free to return to school, as he or she is no longer contagious to others. Your school, however, may require a doctor's note to return, but that is specific to school policy.  ","understand the symptoms of the stomach flu. understand how the illness is spread. assess whether you have a stomach flu. contact your doctor if your illness is very extreme or persists for a long period of time. know when to get emergency care. be aware that dehydration can be more life-threatening in certain people. try to avoid infecting others. keep infected children isolated.

You don't want it to be too tight.  Also, this step makes the length of your toga, so make sure it is long enough. The next step will partly cover your torso.  Come around your right side a second time, again under your right arm. Let it drape down your right side, a little higher than the first time. Throw the end over your shoulder again.  The point should be a bit higher in back than it is in front.  Look in the mirror, and adjust the drape. You may need to pull it in places so it covers more. Lengthen or shorten the ends as needed. You can also pin it to help in stay in place.  A good place to pin it is on the left shoulder.  Though the Romans usually didn't pin their togas, pinning it will give you more freedom to move, as the toga was fairly restrictive.  You can also use a belt to help hold it in place.  You can use plastic swords and shields that can be purchased at a dollar store, toy store, or costume store. You may also look for fake gold chains, jewelry, or amulets to accessorize your toga. Wear sandals to complete the look.  Another option is to create a fake laurel wreath. Unfurl a wire coat hanger, and reshape it into a wreath around your head.

"If the item is made from wool, silk, or cotton, you may gently wash it by hand.  Avoid washing suede, leather, fur, feathers, and other extremely fragile fabrics by hand. These should be taken to the dry cleaner for a professional cleaning.;  , Use soap flakes or a mild detergent, and agitate the water a bit so that it produces some foam.  Never use hot water on items that are meant to be dry cleaned. It will damage the fibers and cause the fabric to shrink.  Woolite is an acceptable detergent to use when hand washing wool.  Submerge it completely, then lift it from the water and dip it again.  Rub any areas that are soiled, such as the armpits and collars, using your finger tips.  Don't use an abrasive scrubber on the clothing, since this may damage the fibers.  Drain the basin of soapy water and fill it with fresh cold water.

"You can find Schedule A at the IRS’s website at http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040sa.pdf or by visiting your local library or Post Office where income tax forms are available.;  , Add together the total amount of all qualified medical and dental expenses as shown on your receipts and report on line 1 of Schedule A. Some expenses that are considered qualified are prescription medications, medical examinations, diagnostic tests, x-rays, and laboratory expenses. To determine which expenses are qualified expenses and may be included, see IRS Schedule A Instructions (“Schedule A Instructions”): http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i1040sca.pdf.  Only those expenses, which exceed 7.5% of your gross adjusted income, may be itemized. To calculate the amount you may itemize:  Take your adjusted gross income, as reported on line 38 of IRS form 1040, and multiply it by .075.  Subtract that number from your total qualified medical and dental expenses.  This is the amount your may claim as a deduction on line 4 of Schedule A.  You should choose the one that gives you the greater deduction and report the amount on line 5 of Schedule A. To calculate the taxes:  State and local income taxes can be determined by adding state and local taxes withheld, as listed on your W2 or 1099, estimated state or local tax payments you made, and mandatory contributions to qualified state programs in certain states. For a complete listing of qualified state programs, see Schedule A Instructions on page 3, at http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i1040sca.pdf.  General sales tax can be determined by adding the actual amount of sales tax you paid, according to your receipts, or by using the tax tables located in the Schedule A Instructions on pages A-12 through A-14 at http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i1040sca.pdf. If you lived in more than one county or state during the year, see the Schedule A Instructions, pages 4 and 5, at http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i1040sca.pdf for information on how to calculate your tax.  The amount can be determined from your tax bills and should be reported on line 6 of Schedule A. Check your tax bill to ensure that no amounts, which are non-deductible, have been included. Non-deductible items include:  Itemized charges for services such as trash collection, lawn mowing, or flat charges for water usage.  Charges for improvements that tend to increase the value of property, such as assessment fees for building a new sidewalk.  Enter each total tax on the appropriate line of Schedule A. Depending on the year of the tax return; you may be able to deduct taxes paid on new vehicles, personal property, or income tax paid to a foreign country or U.S. possession. See the line-by-line instructions for Schedule A at http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i1040sca.pdf for more information on taxes that may be deducted.  If you took out your mortgage after October 13, 1987, and it totaled more than $100,000, see the Schedule A Instructions at http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i1040sca.pdf, to determine if you may deduct all of the interest you paid, or only a part of it. Interest and points are reported on different lines of Schedule A, based on whether it is reported to you on form 1098 or not. Report interest and points according to these guidelines:  Interest and points reported to you on form 1098 should be included on line 10 of Schedule A.  Interest you paid, which was not reported on form 1098, should be included on line 11 of Schedule A, along with the name and address of the person to whom you paid the interest.  Points you paid, which were not reported on form 1098, should be included on 12 of Schedule A.  You may deduct contributions to religious, educational, scientific, charitable, and literary organizations. You may also deduct gifts given to organizations that work to prevent child or animal cruelty. Follow these steps when including any gift in this deduction:  Verify the organization’s charitable status by checking IRS Publication 526 at http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p526.pdf for a list of charitable organizations, calling the IRS at 1-877-829-5500, or asking the organization to provide you with verification.  Determine whether the gift was $250 or more. When calculating the amount of a gift, treat each separate donation as a separate gift. For example, if you gave your church $5 a week for 52 weeks, for a total of $260, you should treat each $5 payment as a separate gift.  For all gifts of $250 or more, obtain a statement from the organization, which lists the amount of the contribution, a description of the property donated, whether you received goods or services in exchange for the gift, and if so, the value of the goods or services you received. Do not send the statement to the IRS with your taxes; simply keep it for your records.  If you gave gifts of more than 30% of your adjusted gross income, as reported on line 38 of IRS form 1040, your gifts of capital gain property were more than 20% of your adjusted gross income, you gave gifts of property that increased in value, or you gave gifts of the use of property, see Schedule A Instructions at http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i1040sca.pdf, for information on the amount which you can deduct.  Include gifts made by check or cash on line 16 of Schedule A, gifts made other than by check or cash on line 17, and gifts made in the previous year, but not reported, on line 18.  You may take a deduction for losses due to theft, fire, vandalism, storm, accidents, or the insolvency or bankruptcy of a financial institution, so long as:  Each separate loss is a loss of more than $100.  The total of all losses, minus the $100 limit, is more than 10% of your adjusted gross income, as reported on form 1040, line 38.  These items are reported and the deduction calculated on Schedule A, lines 21-27 as follows:  Job related expenses for which you were not reimbursed, such as union dues, and work related travel and education should be added up and reported on line 21.  Tax preparation fees, such as those paid to a Certified Public Accountant (“CPA”) or tax preparer, should be tallied, and reported on line 22.  Other expenses should be reported on line 23 and include amounts you paid to produce or collect taxable income and manage income-earning property. For example, your costs to collect rent, make repairs to rental property, and secure the property from vandalism or theft.  Calculate the amount of job related and other expenses that are deductible. To do this, take your adjusted gross income, as reported on line 38 of form 1040, and multiple it by .02, this will give you 2% of your adjusted gross income. Subtract the 2% of your adjusted gross income from the total of your job related expenses, tax preparation fees, and other expenses. The difference is the amount you can deduct, and should be reported on line 27 of Schedule A.

"Your portion needs will depend on age, sex, activity level, and weight goals. Online interactive dietary planners and calorie calculators can help more closely estimate your necessary daily calorie intake and precise portion sizes.  For instance, women whose goal is weight loss can typically succeed with about 1600 calories per day. If weight loss is your goal, your portions will be moderate and will consist mainly of foods that are low calorie and high in nutrients.  For women trying to maintain weight, calorie needs may reach up to 2000 per day. Those who regularly exercise may need additional calories to avoid losing weight. Portion sizes can allow for some higher calorie foods, although it is often healthier to simply consume slightly larger portions of low calorie, nutrient-dense foods.  Men attempting to lose weight should typically aim for 2200 calories a day or a bit more, depending on activity level. Men trying to maintain weight should opt for approximately 2500 calories per day, and very active men may need 3000 calories per day.  Metabolism typically slows down with age. If you are older and typically inactive, slightly smaller than recommended portion sizes may still provide sufficient calories and nutrients for a healthy diet, particularly in combination with a multi-vitamin. Consult a dietitian if you have difficulty losing or maintaining weight for longer than a few months to receive assistance in creating an individualized calorie and portion size dietary plan.;  , Memorize the appropriate serving sizes for each type of food.  In general, the recommended serving size for meat, poultry, or fish is about the size of the palm of your hand or a deck of cards.  A single portion of grain products like rice or pasta would be comparable to the size of your fist. One cup (or an amount like that of your fist) is also the standard serving size for a portion of fruit or vegetables. In terms of everyday objects, this portion size can be compared to the size of a baseball.  The standard portion size for nut butters or other healthy fats are comparable to the size of a golf ball or your thumb. Pancakes should be the size of a CD, a portion of nuts or dried fruit would amount to a small handful, and raw leafy greens or popcorn would be two handfuls.  Drinks such as low-fat milk or milk alternatives and 100% fruit juice are also 1 cup per portion size, comparable to the size of a fist. Because sugary drinks like soda, energy drinks, sports drinks, and flavored coffees are typically of little nutritional value, any portion of these drinks should be limited.  Dozens of charts and tutorials offering simple tips for estimating appropriate portion sizes can be found for free on government, medical, nutrition, and even health-oriented magazine websites. Printing a chart or two and keeping it on the refrigerator for a few weeks can help reinforce the standard portion sizes for different types of food and gradually teach you about portion size.  First, categorize each food by its food group. Consulting a sample chart or using the tips found above, plan the serving size for each food in the meal. This may help in the planning stage of preparing food as well, since understanding appropriate portion sizes can help you figure out exactly how much food to buy and use in a recipe.  A meal should be built based on how many servings you need of each food group per day, which varies by age, sex, height, weight, and physical activity level. The United States Department of Agriculture can create customized daily and weekly serving amounts on their Daily Food Plan: Choose My Plate website found in the Sources section below.  Depending on calorie needs and your goals for losing, maintaining, or gaining weight, measure out portion size at each meal by the above sample portion size comparisons. Using standard portion sizes, you can help balance the meal and keep serving size in check.  Using smaller plates, utensils, and cups can make it easier to measure portion sizes appropriately.  A 9' dinner plate divided into 4 parts makes portion sizing easy and accurate; 1 quarter of the plate should typically be lean protein, 1 quarter should consist of grain products, and the remaining half should be vegetables (and fruit if you like). Those with higher calorie needs may need additional portions; opt for extra servings of vegetables or grains instead of proteins, fats, or dairy.  If one group takes more than its share of the plate, eat only what would classify as the appropriate portion of the plate. For instance, if a steak takes up half of the plate, eat only as much steak as fits in a quarter of the plate, and finish filling up on vegetables and whole grains. Even if your portion sizes are slightly off, filling the plate with healthy foods and avoiding foods high in fat, sodium, or sugar can help you keep calories and serving sizes in check.  Keep in mind that if you have large plates, the suggested portion size estimators will be essential to portion control. Monitoring portion size requires understanding the quantity to put on the plate in each quarter, not just what proportion of the plate to fill with which food group.  Apply sample portion tips to take-out and restaurant foods as well. Request regular or lunch-size portions in place of large or super-size portions (including drinks). If a restaurant does not offer portion size options, request that they put half of the meal in a take-home container before even serving it, so that you do not go overboard on portion sizes.  Foods with high fat, salt, and sugar content may be best in smaller portions than provided in packages or restaurants.  For instance, a burger smothered in cheese sauce, onion rings, and a buttered bun may be best in a half-portion instead of the full burger. Similarly, salads from vendors and restaurants often contain multiple portions of protein, fat, vegetables, and dairy, so restrict the quantity of proteins and fats if you will have other protein and fat portions throughout the day.  ","determine your dietary goals and recommended daily caloric intake. compare sample portion sizes to common items for estimating purposes. apply the tips on individual food portion sizes to determine appropriate portion sizes for the components of each meal. use dinner plate divisions to portion out servings for meals at home. know how to identify foods that throw off calorie counts and portion sizes.

"The wider you cut the strip the larger your rose will be. The same reasoning goes for how long you cut the strip. Use burlap ribbon or cut material around two inches wide and 45 inches long, or about two and a half centimeters by 11 and a half decimeters. Don’t follow the grain of the fabric for a slightly frayed look.  ;  , Take one end of your burlap strip and wrap the entire two inches around a craft wire. You can find wire that is used to make flowers at your local craft store or order it online.  Place a line of hot glue on the burlap next to the wire that is not yet rolled between it. Fold the wire and rolled piece of burlap over once to lay it over the line of hot glue. Press down lightly and let the glue cool down.  Repeat the previous step about three more times, until the roll is about a half inch thick, or one and a quarter centimeters. This will be the middle of your rose.  Hold the burlap strip about two inches from the wire roll. Fold the two inches, or 2.54 centimeters, of fabric over and away from the roll. Make sure you pinch the fold at the bottom of the flower base. This is your first rose petal.  As you pinch the first fold with one hand, slightly turn the stem as you make another fold about a half inch, or one and a quarter centimeters, from the first with your opposite hand. Gather this second petal at the base, along with the other one.  Place a drop or two of hot glue between the folds towards the flower base to secure them together. Be sure to hold the folds together as the glue dries and cools down.  Repeat steps five, six and seven several more times. Remember to hold the fabric at the base of the flower, until you secure it with glue. Continue to turn the wire as you work around the entire stem.  This length is also about one and a half to two decimeters. You should have what looks like a rose at this point, but keep some fabric loose in order to finish it. Make sure you secure the last folds with hot glue.  To really make your rose stem look finished, wrap the rest of it around the base of the rose so that it’s just cupping it. You can wrap all the way around the base and secure it with glue, or use the end to create one last petal.

Are you able to handle the physical demands? Do you like your weekends free? Can you be available for your clients at all times, in some cases even when you’re on vacation?  , Client and vendor management is a significant part of the job.  Can you handle the emotional demands? Are you able to deal positively with all sorts of people? Are you shy or extroverted? You’ll need to be able to interact constructively with almost anyone. , The range in income for wedding planners is anywhere from $15,000 a year to more than $100,000 a year, depending your reputation, how you advertise, where your business is located, and the types of services you offer. , Once you’ve weighed the pros and cons of the very rewarding and demanding landscape of being a wedding planner, you can make a decision about continuing on this career path.  As you slowly start to establish your business, consider the professional and personal experiences you can apply to your new career path.  Do you have experience in event planning? Maybe you excel at throwing birthday and dinner parties. This is experience you can apply to being a wedding planner. If you don’t have any real experience in planning events, you’ll likely want to get some education and experience under your belt before you start planning weddings full-time.  Although there is no formal certification required to be a wedding planner, having some practical knowledge of the business can improve your chances of success. There are many options for education as a wedding planner. You can take online courses or classes at a local college. Wedding conferences and expos may also offer some form of training that could provide you with certification.  Having a certificate showing that you’ve completed a course in wedding planning or joined an association of professional wedding planners will help legitimize you and your business in the eyes of potential clients.  Both the American Association of Certified Wedding Planners and The Association of Bridal Consultants offer certifications. , Reading wedding industry publications like Brides magazine as well as popular books and magazines such as Martha Stewart Weddings will give you good pointers on wedding trends, successful wedding plans, and etiquette conventions.  It’s a good idea to read business publications, too. These will help you think about your own business structure and how to make it successful.  These events will further your knowledge of wedding trends as well as successful business models.  They’ll also give you the chance to network with other wedding planners.  Observing the weddings of family members and friends will give you ideas on what -- and what not -- to do in planning a successful wedding.  Use such occasions to network casually with potential clients and vendors. Just don't let networking diminish the occasion: you're there mainly to celebrate the newly married couple.  Having hands-on experience with wedding planning will give you practical knowledge that you can use for your business. You’re likely to get references from colleagues and suggestions for clients as well.  This will supplement any formal knowledge you have and give you practical experience working in the field.  Your boss can also act as a reference for you with potential clients.  Internships are often unpaid. The experience you gain will be more valuable than a paycheck.  Your boss could wind up a long-term mentor as you rise through the profession.  It might be useful to take a job with a smaller company at first. This will give you the chance to work in all aspects of wedding planning and greatly increase your knowledge.  This will give you the valuable hands-on experience you need -- to say nothing of the chance to prospect for clients at the same time. Use these friends and family members as references.  Be sure to take photos of any event you work on for your portfolio and future marketing efforts. Use these images on your website or in brochures. , Having a list of people whom you can ask questions, draw upon for services, or who are interested in hiring you will put your business on the path to success even in its infancy.  You can meet appropriate people almost anywhere, especially at industry conferences, wedding expos, vendor shops, and, of course, at weddings.  Never stop practicing interpersonal skills as you develop your network.  You’ll need to be a legal entity to legitimize your business. Formalizing a business structure, developing a marketing strategy, and establishing a billing structure will show potential clients that you are a serious businessperson.  If you have any questions, consult the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA), which was set up to help smaller companies. , The SBA and local authorities can help you if you have any questions. Setting up your business with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is also important. , This is an important step as you develop your business. Make these plans flexible to accommodate any contingency (such as illness or a lawsuit).  Having an experienced mentor who knows the ins and outs of the wedding and wedding-planning industries will help you grow your business.  This person can offer invaluable advice on pricing, dealing with difficult clients or vendors, and how to hire staff.  Wedding planners often offer services beyond overseeing the details of weddings. Perhaps you would like to help plan the bride’s shower or the newly married couple’s honeymoon.  If you decide to offer additional services, you’ll need to make sure you’re aware of the latest trends in those areas. You can find this kind of information in the same trade publications mentioned above.  Think about how much you want to charge for your services. Knowing this information in advance will make you appear more professional when you meet with potential clients.  Asking other wedding planners or inquiring what other companies charge will give you a point of reference.  Make sure your prices are commensurate with your experience and your location. Weddings in Buffalo don’t cost as much as they do in New York City.  Once you know your price structure, you can think about how to invoice your customers and the types of payment you will accept.  Have a separate bank account for your business from the one you use for personal finances.  Have separate credit lines, too.  Maintaining fair business practices is vital to your success.  This will be one of many calling cards you can show potential and actual clients. It will also help vendors better meet your needs.  Having something that distinguishes you from other planners will attract clients to your business.  Take pictures of any wedding-planning activities you do, and consistently update them.  Offer different styles of weddings for the wide array of tastes and budgets people will have.  Successful advertising will help you attract clients and build your professional network.Using print media -- brochures, a website, or ads in publications -- is one way to market yourself.  Appearing at wedding conventions is another way to market your services.  Getting involved in community activities is a type of free marketing. Donating a service or making a contribution to charity sends a message to the public you want to serve.  In the early stages you may be the only person on staff. You simply may not be able to afford to hire anyone.  If you decide to hire help, you’ll look for someone who's professional, experienced with weddings, and can help you grow your business.  They will grow as you gather experience. It’s important to continue making new contacts. Your success depends on it.  Consider partnering with other businesses to benefit each other.  Use several different vendors for a given service. If you run into an emergency or have a bad experience with one company, you can turn to others.  Weddings are a very trendy business. Being aware of current trends and continuously accumulating all types of pertinent knowledge is important to your continued success.  The best ways to continue your education are the same as when you first started out: read trade publications, attend weddings, and network with other wedding planners.  You’ve taken the steps to be a wedding planner. Remember to enjoy the chance to be part of a couple's special day.

"It needs to be one that buyers will remember with ease, can type out easily to forward to others, and has a catchy sound to it. Make it easy to spell too.  Consider combining your name with the type of craft or an element of your craft when finding a suitable name for the domain. Sometimes your name alone may suffice.  When coming up with an idea for the domain name, say it out loud. Sometimes what looks good on paper sounds strange when spoken.;  , Customers will be curious to know more about the person behind the crafts and it is also a good way to build online rapport. Don't embellish and make it too long but do point out key motivations, your training/background, and your previous experience.  You need to be able to manipulate and update the site with great ease, all the more important if you're not fully conversant with HTML and other markup language or with programming.  Use high quality photos (learn how to take good product photos) and if it's possible, include the ability for the viewer to turn the product around and see more than one perspective of it. If the product comes in several colors, consider adding a tool that allows the customer to change the shade to see the final look.  Keep photos to a good size but one that can cope with slower download times. Also, don't embellish the site with too many distractions. While it is nice to provide information related to the products and links, these can distract the consumer and you might even lose them by following another link. Stick with information pertinent to the craft products and don't put barriers in the customer's way.  This way you can keep customers informed about new stock, send them information about the craft you're making and even ebooks if that is something you're keen on putting together. A regular newsletter can be a great way to keep clients interested and involved.  Remove broken links, old stock photos, outdated information on a regular basis so that the customer is assured that the information is current and reliable. Make new products really obvious with special designation on the homepage of their category.  Keep a page where your craft has been noted by others in the press, at shows, and where you have won awards. All of this adds to your reputation and credibility and encourages the customers to see you as a popular craftsperson.  If you sell in stores, explain where and use Google Maps to help them locate a store near them. Ask your web designer to help you with this is you don't know how.  Be sure to actively maintain your Twitter and Facebook accounts so that customers feel engaged with you.

"Compound interest is the combination of interest earned on the principal during the current period and  all previous interest earned but not paid for previous periods. In other words, you earn 'interest on interest'. With simple interest, the lender only earns interest on the principal amount per annum. For periods of less than year, the lender will receive a pro rata share of the annual interest. For compound interest, all prior interest is added to the principal amount, effectively increases the annual rate earned by the lender. The use of compound interest and the compounding frequency are established in the loan documents.  The formula to calculate compound interest in a year is: compoundinterest=(P(1+i)n−P){\displaystyle compoundinterest=(P(1+i)^{n}-P)}. In the formula, the variables stand for the following:  P: Principal, the initial amount borrowed or deposited.  i: Interest rate in percentage. The interest rate must be adjusted for the number of compounding periods in a year by dividing the interest rate by the number of periods. For example, a 12 percent interest rate compounded monthly would be adjusted to 1 percent (12/12).  n: Number of Compounding periods in a year multiplied by the loan period in years. Semi-annual compounding is 2, quarterly is 4, monthly is 12, and daily is 360 or 365 depending upon the financial institution.  Solve for i in the equation. This is the interest rate adjusted for the compounding periods per year. For example, a 10 percent loan compounded monthly would have an interest rate of 10/12 or 0.00833. (1 + i) in the formula above would be (1 + .00833), or 1.00833.  Multiply the number of periods per year by the duration of the loan. For example, a 10 year year loan would have 120 periods (10*12).  This is represented by the figure P(1+i)n{\displaystyle P(1+i)^{n}}  in the formula. Raise the figure is parentheses to the power of n (the number of periods), then multiply by the principal. This will give you the future value of the account.  For example, the future value of a $10,000 loan compounded monthly at 10% interest would be $27,059.  Subtract the present value of the loan (the principal) from the future value to arrive at the interest paid over the full ten year period: $27,059 - $10,000 = $17,059.Note that the actual amount may vary depending upon the number of decimal places in the interest rate.  Calculating the compound interest rate for a single year uses the same formula adjusting for the principal amount each year. For example, the first year’s interest on a $10,000 loan compounded monthly at 10% would be $1,047. To calculate the second year’s interest, add the previous year’s interest ($1,047) to the principal amount ($10,000) and recalculate. Interest for the second year would be $1,156.  There are a number of free compound interest calculators on the Internet.  ","understand compound interest. learn the compound interest formula. find the interest rate. solve for the number of compound periods over the term of the loan. solve for the future value of the loan. subtract the principal to get interest expense.

"Getting close to your partner is important for any engagement photos, including beach photos. While being photographed, cuddle, kiss, hold hands, and otherwise get close.Make use of your beach surrounding while cuddling for your photographs. You can, for example, hold hands while walking in the water barefoot or share a kiss while swimming.  Go for some deliberate poses, especially if you have rings. You want to have some photos where your ring or rings are clearly visible. However, candid photos can be great as well. This may lead to unexpected poses or facial expressions that showcase your personalities and the nature of your relationship.Make use of the beach for candid poses. You can, for example, splash in the waves or play beach-related games like volleyball.  Talk to your photographer about how to use the sand and water to inform your pictures. You can take pictures of the two of you, say, seated on a towel in the sand. Try to get some shots walking through the water or even swimming., Kissing on a deck can make for a romantic pose.

"Straight up, starting a new life doesn't happen overnight. It could take years. You'll probably be making such constant small progress that you won't even notice. Imagine losing 1/16th of a pound a day. You're not going to be able to tell for a long time -- but one day your clothes will be far, far too big.  By the time you do notice, you'll probably be so awesome, happy, and content that rock bottom seems like it barely ever existed. Until the moment comes when you wake up and realize, 'Crap. That used to be me, didn't it?' take your time. It'll come. It always does. It's always darkest before the dawn, remember?  , This is another way of saying, 'Slow down before the speed bumps.' There are going to be times when you're about to lose it -- when you feel on the cusp of falling back to where you used to be, only worse (is there a worse than rock bottom?). It's these times when focusing, staying positive, and realizing this is totally normal are absolutely mandatory.  You're striking a serious balancing act between your old life and your new life right now, and that can get pretty daunting. No one expects you to do it with your hands tied behind your back and one eye closed. In fact, we expect you to lean on us for support. That's what we're here for. Though the transitions will be messy, know that they're only temporary. Focus and you'll get through them.  You're on the up and up. Fan-fricking-tastic. Now it's time to find something new. Something fulfilling. Something to drive you. Something to keep those demons at bay. What does your mind immediately jump to? Any passion will do as long as you're passionate about it. It'll take up your time, use your creativity, and give you purpose. All wonderful, wonderful things.  Being truly good at something is so rewarding. Being truly good at something you really, really enjoy is even more rewarding. Cultivating a passion, regardless of what it is, can do great things for your sense of self. You'll get so well-established that rock bottom isn't a place on your map anymore. It got erased.  Now that you have all these new ideas that are fresh and exciting, you've gotta stabilize and make them just part of your everyday world. It might take a few weeks, but balancing work, a social life, your passions, and free time will eventually all fall into place. There's no reason it shouldn't.

"Country style utilizes a lot of reds and blues. Lighter colors are usually better in a sunnier climate. Brown leather is often better than black. Match, but create contrast. If necessary, use a color wheel to determine what works best.  Darker shades are less suited for warm climates but hide dirt well. Plan accordingly.  A plain colored tee or a well-fitting button-down top are simple and effective. Sleeve length, neckline, and material are all factors to consider. Women's tops are highly variable, and you can show off as much or as little skin as necessary to suit your individual style.  For the tried-and-true cowgirl, nothing beats a snap-button plaid or red-and-white checkered shirt. Graphic tees can be stylish, but choose a design carefully, and don't make the mistake of assuming that a beer logo or a Confederate flag automatically makes the wearer country.  Nothing says country quite like blue denim. Straight or boot cut jeans work best. Levi's and Wrangler are classic western brands that won't break the bank. Gold or white threading complements a good pair nicely. Avoid elaborate, flashy designs. Jeans with lower rises are a safe choice. High rises are more traditional and difficult to pull off in a non-work setting.  For an especially hot summer day, opt for a pair of short jean shorts.  Thin cotton or cotton blends will be the most versatile, but denim works here as well, and can be very traditional. Light, tan, or pale colors are safe. Floral patterns also work well. Skirts should stop an inch or two short of the knee, but can occasionally go longer. Long summer dresses can be useful on a windy day.  There's no replacement for cowboy boots. Heels are simply too burdensome for trying to navigate through fields of dried dung. It's difficult to go wrong with the color and style: tall, short, buckle, no buckle, ornate or minimal embroidery all work exceptionally well. (Short boots are best worn with shorts or skirts, however). Have at least several pairs to swap out in different colors and styles. Leather is essential, and plastic should be reserved for nights out on the town.  You can find boots in just about every price range, but expect to pay at least $200 for a quality, lasting pair.  ","choose a color scheme. wear a simple, casual top. put on a good pair of jeans. try on a dress or skirt. wear the boots. "
"No matter what the cause of your vaginal itching, you may be able to get temporary relief from the discomfort by applying a cool compress, like a washcloth, to your labia.To use a cold compress, take a clean washcloth and hold it under cold, running water until it is saturated. Then, wring out the excess water and apply the cloth to your vaginal area for about five to 10 minutes.  Make sure that you wash the washcloth after using. If you want to repeat the treatment, use a new washcloth.  You can also use an ice pack. Just make sure that you wrap the ice pack in a clean paper towel and do not leave it on your vaginal area for more than 20 minutes at a time.;  , Irritants from your laundry detergent, soap, or other products may be causing your vaginal itching.Switching to unscented laundry detergent and skipping fabric softener may help to relieve vaginal itching caused by allergies. You may also want to switch to a gentle cleanser to eliminate potential irritants from your shower gel.  For example, you could try using Dove bar soap or Cetaphil gentle skin cleanser.  Avoid scented cleansers, wipes, powders, and other products that might irritate your vaginal area.  You can purchase aqueous creams and emulsifying ointments that will help relieve feminine itch at most pharmacies. Be sure to follow all of the instructions for application, and be aware that these products will not treat the underlying cause of your itching., Scratching will likely only worsen the irritation and cause even more itching. It may even lead to an infection if you cause a lesion, so avoid scratching at all costs., Some women may experience occasional vaginal itching that does not require any kind of treatment, but if you have severe or persistent itching, there’s a good chance that there is some underlying cause.

"Losing your hair can be emotionally challenging. Accepting hair loss from chemo won’t happen overnight, in part because hair loss is often devastating for women and men. Keeping in mind that it is only temporary and a part of making you healthy again can help you embrace it more easily., For example, don’t wear a wig, hat, or scarf at night or one day a week. You can build up to never using an aid or only on occasions when it’s absolutely necessary.Give yourself daily positive affirmations such as “I am strong and beautiful and will beat this cancer—hair or no hair!” This can boost your confidence and may make it easier to accept your hair loss., Most people are kind, especially if they know you’re battling cancer. However, there are still some social stigmas attached to hair loss and cancer, such as robbing the person of privacy about their illness and lowering of status.These may cause you stress, anxiety, or embarrassment. Confronting negativity and your own feelings may help you get your feelings and focus on promoting your health.See a counselor or doctor to help you actively manage your feelings. Friends and loved ones can also provide you with support.  It may be stressful thinking about how people will react to your hair loss. Letting friends, family members, and co-workers know about potential hair loss can help avoid uncomfortable questions or looks. This may help you be more at ease and able to focus on your health.Be open about your condition. Saying, “I’m undergoing chemo and it’s caused me to lose my hair” can dissolve tension or minimize unwelcome glances from other people.  Let people know if shaving their own heads to support you is a welcome gesture or not., Meeting and discussing your chemo-related hair loss with a support group can offer you unconditional support from others who understand what you’re experiencing. It may also help you get past your feelings about your hair loss.Sign up for online or local support groups and even courses about hair loss and how to manage it.For example, the American Cancer Society has courses on coping with self-esteem issues related to cancer.

"Set aside a book or journal to write down all information you found, its sources and when you obtained it. This will help you keep track of all data so it can be organized better. A journal will help you to ensure that nothing is lost, as you may come across quite a lot of information, ensuring as well that you don't forget anything.  Once you have the information neatly sorted in a journal, you will know where to go to get verification.  Talk to as many family members as you can, especially older members of the family, such as grandparents, who would be happy to give you any information or family history that they know of.  Consider recording your talks with family members, especially older family members. These oral records can be kept on your computer for ease of reference and verification of exactly what was said.;  , Ask them about their great-grandparents and about what they know and remember of your family's history on that side of the family.  Ask about how they got to America, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, etc., if you live in such places. Or, ask them how they got to wherever they are now anyway––all the facts are relevant in piecing together your history.  Ask questions about who your ancestors were, what they were like, where they were native to, etc.  Ask for anything your eldest family member didn't know or hasn't made clear. It's also good to ask as many people as possible, to allow you to cross check the information gained.  If your family keeps such a record, it would be useful to construct a family tree from this information. You can also contact family members through these records to get more information.  This is very useful if the pictures have descriptions behind it, if not, you would want to find an older family member to go through the pictures with you. If you have constructed a general family tree already, this would be a good way to put a face on those people. Pictures can also be very good clues about the personalities and occupations of your relatives.  This would include christmas cards, holiday greetings and letters. If you are researching beyond your grandparents, any kept letters from their time should provide a little insight into the generation older than them.  There are websites online dedicated to tracking down family history and ancestry. These include such sites as Cyndi's List - www.cyndislist.com and LDS - www.FamilySearch.org.  Libraries have very many old newspapers and might have diary-like books from a long time ago. Look for stories, awards, work histories, etc., with your ancestors in it.  If any of your ancestors were writers, you may be able to find written work of theirs, anything from advertising blurb and stories to letters to the editor and articles.  Once you have all your data and a good enough collection to finalize it, put it together in a professional data base. Examples of free and commercial databases are: Brother's Keeper (Windows, Free Trial once downloaded), RootsMagic Essentials (Windows, free), Gramps (Linux, Free open source), Family Tree Maker (Windows, fee-based) and MyHeritage Family Tree Builder (Windows, Free).

"A real hero knows that their actions might go unnoticed and that’s okay. Make sure you are trying to be a hero for the right reasons. You’ll need to be willing to help people who might not even know you have intervened in their lives. You’ll have to be focused more on the feeling you get from doing the good deed than the praise. Find the joy in seeing the smiles on other people’s faces.  Think about how you would feel having a good deed done for you. That will help you connect to the joy or change you’ve created in another person’s life.;  , A true hero isn’t all talk. They are constantly thinking about how they can take action and help. You may be inspired to be a hero for a certain cause or issue, or you may try to be a hero to someone in need.For example, if you are passionate about the environment, don’t just preach to people that they should recycle. Try to start an environmental club at your school or get your friends together to help you build a compost bin in your backyard.  Maybe you are passionate about helping the homeless in your area. Rather than giving one homeless person money, you may get involved at your local homeless shelter and hand out food and basic supplies to the homeless in your area instead.  Think about what other people might need before you consider your own needs. When you are making decisions at work or at home, take some time to think about how your actions will affect someone else. If you take the day off of work, what kind of workload will that put on your coworkers?  Remember that people think differently. What seems comfortable or easy for you might not seem that way to other people. You might feel really confident going to a karaoke night with a bunch of strangers, but your friend or date might not. Consider what other’s want in addition to what makes you happy.  People lead busy lives. Often a typical person is so focused on themselves, they don’t notice or care to act when something is wrong. But a hero will be willing to take action and confront injustice straight on. Stick up for a friend, classmate, or coworker you feel is being treated unfairly. Buy a meal for the homeless person everyone keeps walking by on the street. Notice someone who is the underdog or who is less fortunate and give them a helping hand.  You can also focus on creating safe spaces for individuals who suffer from injustice or prejudice. This could be advocating for a space on your campus for queer-identifying students, or a club for women of color to network and connect.  A hero doesn’t just intervene when they see wrong being done. A true hero is out to do good at any time. This might mean taking some extra time out of your day to look for a good deed. You can do anything from paying for the coffee of the person behind you in line at the coffee shop to helping some lost tourists find their way around the city. Other random acts of kindness you can do include:  Raking your neighbor's leaves for them.  Helping to pay a student's tuition.  Buying lunch for the office.  Washing a friends car for them.  Buying groceries for someone in need.  There are many charities and nonprofit organizations across the country that simply need people to volunteer a few hours each week to help them reach their goals. Offer to work for a local 5k marathon that is raising money for breast cancer or another cause you feel passionate about. You can also volunteer your time in other ways:Help build houses for low-income families.  Join a community garden.  Get involved with your neighborhood watch.  You don’t always have to volunteer in such an official way. You can offer to help a friend move or give up some time to listen when a family member is in need of emotional support.  First think about the things you are good at or skills that have come in useful in the past. You can ask your friends and family what they think you are good at. They may already have a good idea about your strengths and how you can best utilize them to be a hero.  Think about how you can use your talents to help others.  Perhaps you are a great public speaker, or maybe you have a talent for making things with your hands like craft projects or furniture. Maybe you are a great listener and are good at being empathetic to the needs of others.  You can also use your professional skills and knowledge to help others. If you are a teacher, you might volunteer some time to help tutor students who are having trouble in school. If you are an artist, you might volunteer your time and skills to help teach senior citizens how to paint or sketch.  Sometimes people need help but don’t know how to ask for it. Become the type of person who isn’t just waiting around for opportunities to be a hero. Make your own by asking others if there is anything you can do for them.  Think about what you had a hard time with when you started your job. Offer to assist new employees with working the copy machine, getting to know certain procedures, or setting up their email.  A hero understands that the little things in life can add up to big things. You can do small gestures like holding open the door for people or offering to take a friend out to lunch. You could give someone a ride to the airport or pay for someone's laundry at the laundromat.  Even offering someone kind words can help you grow as a hero. Say thank you to service workers. Tell a friend you appreciate them.  Give a friend a hug.  Write your teacher a thank you note.  Send a family member a surprise email or text telling them you love them.  Speaking out against injustice is important, but speaking out in favor of peace is just as valuable.  Think about things in terms of “Pro” instead of “Anti”. Be pro-peace instead of antiwar. Be pro-environment instead of just antipollution.Be a good leader. If you are a teacher or in charge of a team at work, know that you have people that look up to you. Lead them by example. If they see you thanking people for their hard work, highlighting the achievements of others, and going out of your way to do favors, they are more likely to do the same.  A good hero is vigilant. They are aware of their surroundings and constantly on the lookout for situations where they may be of help to others. Start small. Think about the people you come across regularly in your daily life. The coworker in the cubicle next to you or the student who sits behind you in English class. What do you know about them? When might there have been an opportunity to be a hero to them in the past? How can you be ready for a similar opportunity in the future? If you are in line at the grocery store and the person behind you seems like they are in a hurry, let them cut in front of you.  If you recognize that a fellow classmate is struggling in a class you excel at, offer to study with them after school.  Watch for people on the subway who may need your seat. The elderly, a pregnant woman, someone on crutches.  Think about the people in your life who have acted like heroes. What were times when you felt lost or scared only to have another person come along and help you through a tough time? Maybe they were strangers. Perhaps a teacher or relative was there for you when you really needed someone. Think about what they did and how it made you feel.You can ask some of your own heroes for advice. Ask them how they are able to put others before themselves.  Don’t be afraid to imitate..Chances are that the way someone helped you will work for other people as well. If a friend helped you by being a good listener, you can do the same for someone else.  ","let go of your ego. be the change you want to see. put others before yourself. be ready to act when others are passive. perform random acts of kindness. volunteer your time. volunteer your talents. ask if you can help someone. use small gestures. promote the good.being a hero is not just about working to put down the bad things in life like poverty, inequality, and oppression, it is also about working to promote and advance the good things in life like charity, kindness, gratitude and love. be on the lookout for opportunities. learn from your own heroes.no one becomes a hero all on their own.

"While you're planning your trip, research the infectious diseases endemic to the area you want to visit. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) offers a useful webpage that allows you to easily identify illnesses by country. Knowing the diseases you may encounter will allow you to prepare properly!;  , Visit your doctor 4-6 weeks before you leave for your trip. Ensure you are up-to-date on general vaccinations like Measles, Mumps, Pertussis, and Tetanus, and receive any vaccinations you need to for your trip. Some vaccines are recommended, but in other cases, you will not be allowed to enter a country without proof of vaccination.  Vaccination: If you're traveling to an area where Diphtheria, Hepatitis A, B, C, or E, Influenza, Viral Meningitis, Japanese Encephalitis, Polio, Rabies, Rubella, Typhoid, or Yellow Fever rates are high, consider vaccination to protect yourself.  Medication: If you are traveling to an area where malaria is present, talk to your doctor about anti-malaria medication.  Insect Repellant: Many infections are caused by bug bites including malaria, dengue, trypanosomaisis, chikungunya, yellow fever, and West Nile virus. There are no known cures to these ailments, so protect yourself from exposure by using insect repellent. Look for strong active ingredients like DEET, Picaridin, oil of lemon, eucalyptus, and IR3535, and wear permithrin-treated clothing.  In some instances, you may choose to cancel, reschedule, or postpone your trip. For example, the CDC strongly recommends that pregnant women avoid locations endemic with malaria. If you are pregnant and must travel to a country where malaria is present, talk to your doctor about your anti-malaria medication options.  The CDC offers valuable infectious disease travel information by country, and updates the travel warning regularly.  You can contract various types of infection by drinking contaminated water or eating contaminated food. Areas with poor water sanitation or inadequate sewage systems can lead to infection.  In these locations, avoid contaminated water by only drinking unopened canned or bottled drinks and avoiding ice. Beverages involving boiled water like coffee and tea are okay.  Avoid possible contaminated foods like meat that has been allowed to cool (street vendors), raw vegetables including salads, raw fruit unless it is washed with clean water and peeled, and unpasteurized dairy.  Travelers commonly experience diarrhea which can often be cured with rest and hydration.  If diarrhea persists, contact your doctor.  If you experience fever at all, inform your doctor upon your return.  If you become very ill, contact the nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulate.They can help you find a doctor near your current travel location.  For more information regarding illness abroad, look to the CDC's research on Obtaining Health Care Abroad.

"Read the organization's mission statement and spend some time learning about them through their website. If the client is an individual, learn more about them from whomever or wherever you discovered they might be a potential client.  Once you know more about the potential client, you should come up with a plan for attracting their business. Mention problems you can fix or services you provide, specifically choosing subjects that are most relevant to the client's work or problem.  If someone is hiring a freelancer, read the description of the job thoroughly. Alter your resume or statement to appeal precisely to what the client is looking for. If they are looking for a specific skill you have, even if it seems minor or included in other resume items, mention that qualification.  Your potential client might receive requests like yours regularly, or they might never have considered hiring someone for your service. Here are several ideas for how to attract someone's attention:Describe a specialized skill rare among your competitors. Knowledge of an obscure programming language, art form, or other niche qualification related to your work could grab a client's attention and impress them even if they don't end up using that skill.  Mention a famous client of yours, or briefly describe one or two of your most impressive accomplishments.  If you can't compete using fame or specialization, hook a client by offering cheap or even free work on a temporary basis. This is a good strategy when you are starting out and need clients to recommend you.  Your statement or sales pitch should only take 2 or 3 minutes to read or listen to, at most. Cut it down to 30 seconds if possible. Extra information such as a curriculum vitae or sample work can go in separate documents to be presented after the pitch.  Stay focused on specific skills you have and specific proposals you have for working with the company. Avoid vague or rambling wording.  If you are responding to an advertisement, you should follow the contact instructions included. If you are contacting an organization, ask the receptionist or the general purpose phone line who best to contact for your type of proposal, and how he or she prefers to be contacted.  If you live nearby and are good with in-person statements, try to schedule a personal meeting. If you can't, arrange to drop off a proposal in person, and include a shorthand written note to demonstrate personal effort.  Simple details such as promptness, listening to the other party, appropriate language, and staying positive can go a long way towards signing your next deal. Dress nicely and be on your best behavior during every interaction. Unprofessional interactions with a secretary or a stranger in the company lobby have the potential to destroy your chances just as they do in an executive office.  Make sure to include all contact information and any additional information the client needs to make their decision. Provide a business card and/or a brochure if you see the potential client in person or mail them a package.  Describing yourself with the wrong title may hurt your business. Only call yourself the CEO or president of your company if you are in a roomful of people with similar titles. Otherwise, call yourself a representative, a manager (if you have employees), or a specific title that describes the work you do.  ","research the potential client before you contact them. begin to write a statement customized to the client's needs. begin with a hook that makes you stand out. edit your statement until it is concise and clear. once you have a statement prepared, find out who to contact and how to go about it. be professional. provide information to the potential client as you make your pitch.

"The size of a first aid kit depends on how it is being used, and how many people will use it. In general, if your fist aid is coming with you on a camping excursion it should be big enough to stock adequate supplies for everyone in attendance but also lightweight and portable.If you're backpacking alone or with one or two other people, keep it on the smaller side as the less items in your backpack the better. Added weight can cause back strain and fatigue that can interfere with your journey.  If you're camping with a big group, family sized first aid kits are available online and at camping and department stores.  If you're using an RV or a car camper, you should consider investing in a car emergency kit, sold online or in camping stores, that includes car essentials like cable ties, bungee cords, and spark plugs in the event of an automobile emergency.;  , First aid kits come in all shapes and sizes, and are built from a variety of materials. While some people use their backpacks/totebags or cardboard boxes as first-aid kits, for camping you will need a waterproof container that seals shut. Go for materials like plastic, metal, and tin. Remember, size matters. Base what you use as a container on the number of fellow travelers and the length of your trip. If you're comfortable crafting a kit yourself, possible containers include:  Lunch boxes, food tins, tackle boxes, and other food storage containers, reusable or disposable. Very helpful are First Aid boxes from Stock of the Army Medical Corps. Newer versions are plastic-made and have a tightening gasket plus the Red Cross badge outside.  A zipper top clear plastic bag.  Clean plastic food containers., If you're not into DIY creations, purchase a first aid kit. Costs vary depending on size, whether the kit is stocked, and its material.  You can find first aid kits as many mass merchandise retailers, such as drug stores, grocery stores, discount stores, and convenience stores.  Speciality retailers, such as outdoor and camping stores, can provide first aid kits that are camping specific. The employees should also be able to answer any questions you have, so this would be a great option if you're new to camping.  First-aid kits are available online. However, you should avoid purchasing a first-aid kit online if you're unfamiliar with camping and do not know exactly what you're looking for., You need to be prepared for accidents while camping, and having supplies ready in the event of a wound or a burn is important. Get these items together for your kit:  Bandages, in assorted sizes and shapes. Make sure to include butterfly bandages, which will hold the edge of a deep cut together, and triangular bandages to create slings or hold dressings.  Blister pads  Gauze pads  Elastic bandages for wrapping sprains  Moleskin  Q-tips  Antiseptic wipes  Antibiotic cream , e.g. PVP Iodine solution and / or ointment.  Burn ointment  Rubbing alcohol, to clean tools such as tweezers in the event they are needed for an injury  Hydrogen Peroxide about 3 % as solution.  Some plastic vials with sterile NaCl 0,9% solution may be very helpful to rinse dirt away from the eyes or for cleaning a dirty wound as 1st step care.  While on the trail, anything you need for your personal medical care should be packed in a first aid kit.Any prescription medications you or your fellow travelers use.  Over-the-counter pain management medication, like aspirin and ibuprofen.  Gastrointestinal meds, such as antacids and anti-diarrheal medication.  Antihistamines in the event of allergic reactions, e.g. Hydrocortisone Cream as OTC.  Topical antibiotic cream to treat small, shallow wounds.  While camping, you will need a variety of tools to get through snares and wounds on the trail. In your fist aid kid, you should store:  Tweezers  Scissors  Magnifying glass  Safety pins  Duct tape  Needle with thread, in the event repairs are needed  Medical gloves, which are needed for handling unsanitary materials  Waterproof matches and fire starter  Water purification tablets, in the event you run out of water and need to use stream or lake water  Small-edge razor blade  Fingernail clippers  Flashlight  A variety of batteries  Emergency blanket, which is an aluminum style reflective blanket to have on hand if temperatures drop dangerously low or if you get wet, Depending on weather and other conditions, you may need some of the following creams and sprays on your trip:.  Anti-itch creams or sprays, particularly those that help relieve itching and pain from bug bites and contact with poisonous plants  Burn relief sprays  Petroleum jelly for chafing  Lip balm  Sunscreen  , These additions are optional, and depend whether you need them for your personal care.:  Epi-pen, if you suffer from severe allergic reactions.  Multivitamins, if you have a special diet plan.  Snake-bite kit if you're hiking in an area where snakes are present.  Dog boots, if you're hiking with a dog. These can protect their feet on harsh terrain.  Baby wipes, if you have a small child.  Anti-chafing of ant-friction cream, if you're hiking in humid environments.  Depending on what the weather will be during your camping trip, special supplies might be needed. Make sure to check the forecast before setting out.  If you're camping in hot or humid conditions, bring waterproof sunscreen and lip balm that is at least SPF 15, coolers for drinks and food, and clothing made from light fabrics like nylon and polyester.If you're camping somewhere cold, bring chapstick and moisturizer as winter can lead to dry, irritated skin., Group items together based on their usability. That is, keep your medical supplies in one section, your burn wound and care supplies in another, and so on. If you bought your first aid kit online or from a retailer, they should have separate sections built in. If not, you can glue in cardboard or plastic as a barrier or keep items in small plastic bags together. Organization is important as, in the event of an emergency, you should be able to locate needed items fast.  Some times in your first aid kit need to be sealed in plastic bags before being stored. Make sure you know what to bag.  Anything with a strong scent, like lotion and some antifungal creams, should be bagged to mask the smell and deter predators.  If you're camping at a faraway location and taking your first aid kit on a plane, you'll need travel sized versions of liquids, gels, and creams. For carry-on, all liquids must be in containers of 3.4 ounces or less and these bottles must all be placed together in a ziplock plastic bag. This bag can be no more than one quart in size., The night before you leave for your camping trip, make sure all items in the fist aid kit are stores and ready. Make sure medications are not expired, batteries are in working order, tweezers and other tools are sharp and ready.  ","make a decision about size. decide what to use as the container. know where to purchase a first aid kid. collect wound and burn care. gather medical essentials. include tools. take a variety of sprays and creams. pack any miscellaneous items specific to your circumstances. consider weather conditions. organize your supplies. figure out what needs to go in a plastic bag. give your kit a check up before you leave.

"Guppy fry will grow fast when their water quality is good. To keep it pristine conditions use a test kit and test for ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate. Keep ammonia at 0 ppm., nitrite at 0 ppm., and nitrate at less than 10 ppm. Keep doing weekly water exchanges, but exercise caution not to suck up any fry.;  , Do not let the water temperature get outside this range.  Make sure the filter has some kind of protective sponge over the intake to prevent small fry from being sucked in.  Guppy fry are an excellent food source for most types of fish (even their parents). Separate fry from all adult fish if possible. Placing them in their own separate tank is best, but if you do not have an extra aquarium you'll need to get a mesh 'breeding tank'. These devices go inside your existing aquarium, and serve as a holding pen for the fry or the adults. If you are going to keep the fry in this container, make sure it is mesh, otherwise they might swim out.  When the female gets a dark gravid spot and then becomes very puffed up and blocky and starts to get an uneven look around the torso, she's full of fry and about to give birth. Place her in a breeding box, which has a divider with slots in it. The breeding box floats in the aquarium. Have it floating before you catch the female. After the female has given birth, which takes up to six hours, and she is no longer producing young, remove her from the breeding box. She can go back with the other adult fish.  If you have a separate tank for the fry, you can release them into it. (That's where they should be floating.) If not, you can remove the female and the divider from the breeding box and keep the fry in it for some time.  If you do not remove the female, she will eat any fry that find their way back up into the top part of the box.  Baby guppies need high quality foods to grow and be healthy. When they are first born use fry food or finely crushed flake food. As they get bigger keep using flake food.  Diseased fry have a very low chance of surviving. Remove any sick fry immediately. Do not medicate a tank with fry in it, as it is too difficult for a regular fish keeper to use the right dosage.  Monitor their growth, and place them back into the main aquarium once they are big enough not to be eaten. This is about a fourth of an inch or more. Make sure they are all growing fairly uniformly. Once they are all big enough, release them and watch them interact with their expanded world.  ","check the water quality. keep the water temperature at 75-80f. use a sponge filter or a very low power mechanical filter to keep water clean. survey the tank setup. remove the female from the breeding box promptly. be sure you feed them well. check for illnesses. watch the fry grow.

"Make a plan to give up one kind of non-vegan food per week. Not only will this make for an easier lifestyle adjustment, but it will also help your body make the transition as smoothly as possible. Any sudden, drastic change in your diet would likely wreak havoc on your body, especially if you go from being an omnivore to being a vegan.  Listen to your body and be easy on yourself. Don't force yourself to completely change everything at once without guidance. You need to know how to properly substitute for certain elements such as protein and fats before thinking that a head of lettuce is all you need for the rest of your life. Start by removing meat, then eggs and cheese, then all dairy products, and then worry about diligence when it comes to ingredients lists (some get pretty sneaky).  It's much trickier for vegans than for vegetarians. You already know that you can't eat cheese because cows are exploited in order to generate the milk to make cheese, but did you know that even most cheese alternatives contain casein, a milk protein? Do your homework and read ingredient labels to prevent accidental consumption of non-vegan food.  You'll soon find that vegan websites will endorse certain brand name products. Knowing what to look for in the aisles will cut down on turning grocery shopping into a tedious chore.  It's a good source of both protein and calcium, and you can prepare it in a variety of ways. It takes a little getting used to, especially if you've never eaten much tofu before, but give it a chance.  Tofu, along with soy or rice milk and other non-meat alternatives, can be your best friends in the vegan world. Name a product, there's a tofu version of it. And it doesn't taste bad either!  , Most prepared foods are going to be off-limits, so whether you like it or not, you're going to have to learn to cook. It'll give you a greater connection with your food, as it can be exciting and very rewarding (your friends and family will dig it, too). Recognize that the taste and experience of your food is just as important as the practicality of implementing it into your lifestyle. Be creative and choose a variety of produce and products to avoid monotony and boredom.  There are many vegan cookbooks and free online recipes nowadays to provide you with inspiration. Investing of your best energies and mental capabilities to the daily task of cooking vegan meals can enhance your enjoyment and satisfaction of re-training your taste buds to savor new, even strange flavors. Who knew this path was going to be so exciting?  ","ease into it. know the difference between live foods and life-less products consumed as food. learn about tofu (and soy products in general). make time to cook. "
"Do they maybe have a crush on you, and vice versa? Depending on the romantic intentions either of you has, they may hesitate to text back immediately. This way they avoid seeming over eager.  They may be working, in the middle of a conversation, still sleeping, or even at a movie. Many people choose to leave their phones at home or keep them out of sight as a way to disconnect from electronics. When you start to use your imagination, many reasons appear for why people don't text back. Oftentimes we take it personally that other people don't respond to us when it's just a matter of circumstance.  Texting someone in the middle of the night, or while they are on vacation will likely not get a response. It's important that people have the right to choose how accessible they are. Although it can be frustrating and often we can be impatient with text messaging specifically, it's important to simply acknowledge that people do not owe us an immediate response.  Since most of us are using phones and laptops with rechargeable batteries, it's always possible that the battery is just dead. Or that someone dropped their phone in a liquid or cracked the screen beyond use. Or, if you're asking someone you don't know well to text you, like someone who has something for sale, remember not everyone has a cell phone and that some people only keep one for emergencies.  Depending on the nature of your relationship to this person, their could be any number of social reasons you haven't gotten a response. If it's a potential lover, maybe they're nervous, or maybe they're not interested. If it's your friend, maybe they are focused on their creative endeavors and figure you'll understand. If it's family, maybe they're angry at you for something undiscussed and just don't want to talk to you.  If you're texting an older person, it's common they are unschooled in the ways of smart phones and texting. Maybe they need help getting comfortable with the medium before they can meet your response expectations.  One way to get people texting that are unfamiliar, is to include them in group texts with other people who are more comfortable and respond regularly. For example you could have a group chat with your parents and siblings, so they can learn by example how most people text.  Oftentimes if we let go of focusing on whether someone is responding to us or not, we end up doing something more purposeful. And then sooner or later you get the text back you were waiting on.  ","think about your relationship with this person. consider other people's lives. know that texting decreases privacy and social boundaries. consider technical issues. consider who the person is. consider their skill level with technology. be patient.

"It is suggested that margin sizes be 1-1.5 inches (3-3.5 cm).;  , Do not make indentations unless you are using bullets to clarify a point.  Avoid 'justifying' or 'align righting' your letter. These alignments make letters difficult to read. Your right margins should be ragged, not uniform.  This allows for the correct amount of white space and ease of reading.  Most readers find starting letters or paragraphs near the end of a page challenging. It tends to interrupt a reader's concentration.  Having these gaps tell the reader you are moving on to the next point or topic of the letter.  This break between blocks of text is also a way to give the person's eyes a break while he or she is reading.  This can also give the reader an illusion of more white space.  ","set uniform margins on the left and right sides of the document. keep all your paragraphs lined up on the left side throughout your letter. start the body of your letter no lower than midway down your page. leave 2 lines of space between paragraphs. organize your letter so it does not appear repetitive by mixing up your use of paragraph lengths.

"You will learn best and have the easiest time in school if your body is ready to learn! There are lots of things that you can do to get your body ready. Try:  Get lots of sleep. You’ll need to get the right amount of sleep for your body if you want your brain to work at its best. You should feel alert through most of the day. If you find yourself needing to shut your eyes by lunch, you’re not sleeping enough. For most people, you’ll need about 8 hours of sleep.  Your body can’t work right if all you eat is junk like chips, candy, and hamburgers. If you want to be the best student you can be, eat your vegetables (like broccoli), some fruit, and lean proteins (like chicken and fish).  Drink plenty of water. Your brain needs water in order to work right. In fact, your whole body needs water in order to work right. Drink several glasses of water a day but keep in mind that some people need more water than others. If your pee is coming out dark colored, you need more water, whereas if it's clear, that's typically excess water.;  , Everyone learns best in different ways; this is called a learning style.Find a way that works for you and try to learn that way as much as you can. You’ll have more control over this when you study at home, but you can also talk to your teacher about adjusting how the lessons are taught to include more variety for different style learners.  For example, have you noticed that it’s really easy for you to remember charts or pictures? This means you might be a visual learner, which means you should use more images and pictures in order to learn. An example of this would be if you drew yourself a chart to memorize the parts of speech.  Maybe you've noticed that you have an easier time studying when you listen to music quietly or that you can't remember what your teacher wrote on the board but you can 'hear' what they said in your head as if they were in the room now. This means you might be an auditory learner, which means you learn better with sound. An example of this would be if you record your teacher when they're talking so that you can listen to it while you do your homework or study.  Maybe you've noticed that, during a lesson, you feel like you still want to pay attention but you really need to stand up or move around. Maybe you pace around your room while you study. This might mean that you are a kinesthetic learner, which means you learn better when you're doing things with your body. Try playing with a piece of clay in your hand while your teacher talks.  The best thing that you can do to become the best student in any class is pay attention when your teacher is talking. If you get distracted you might miss important information and you'll have a harder time understanding what to do or when you have to study later.  If you're having trouble staying focused when your teacher is talking, try sitting in the front and participating more in the class. Raise your hand and ask questions when you don't understand something or when your teacher says something interesting and you want to know more about it.  Taking notes (and taking notes well) can be tricky, but it will make it much easier for you to learn and study, which means your grades will get better and your test scores will improve so you're the best student in your class. Just remember, you don't have to write down everything your teacher says. Just write down the most important things and the things you know you'll have a hard time remembering.  Even if you don't get very good grades on your homework, just doing it on time will help keep your grade up as much as possible. You should aim to make your homework marks the highest in the class or you're not really trying to be the best in your class. Beyond that, do as well on your homework as you can. When you don't understand it, ask someone for help! Your teacher might be able to set you up with a tutor or even help you themselves.  Schedule enough time to actually get your homework done. This might mean watching less TV or spending less time with your friends but it will be worth it in the end.  Getting a good environment to do homework will really help you to get it done. Go somewhere quiet where you don't have any distractions. If you can go to a library, that's a good spot. If you can't leave your house and the people you live with are noisy, try your bathroom.  Learning stuff that isn't included in your classes can help you understand the information you do cover a lot better and it can also really impress your teacher. Pursuing information in a way that follows your interests can also help you stay focused in class. Look for more ways to learn about all of the subjects you study and you'll find that all of school is more interesting and that you're more and more successful.  For example, if you're studying American history, you can watch documentaries online to learn even more about the era you're learning about.  You can learn by studying books from your local library and you can also learn a lot online. While Wikipedia isn't always accurate, it's usually pretty good. You can also find documentaries and educational videos on YouTube, like the popular shows Crash Course and TedTalks. These have a lot information that your teacher or professor didn't explain it well enough for you.  Learn when school is out of session too. Keep learning during the summer, on the weekends, and start preparing for your next year of school as early as you can by finding out what kind of stuff you'll study. As for the summers, just reviewing the information you already learned for just two or three hours three or four times over the course of the whole summer can help make sure that you're ready when the school year starts.  One of the most effective ways to get better scores on tests is to start studying and preparing for the test as early as possible. Definitely don't leave it until the night before. The harder the test will be, the earlier you should start studying. Two or three weeks is usually a good starting point.  ","get your brain and body ready to learn. learn in a way that works for you. pay attention. learn how to take notes. do your homework on time and well. look for extra ways to learn. study earlier. "

"This bait is widely used in many types of fishing. Use earthworms or manure worms in freshwater and bloodworms or sandworms in saltwater. Mealworms and other live grubs are usually used for trout or bass.  Pierce through several smaller worms or cut up worm halves to hide the hook in a mass of wriggling worms. Some hooks come with smaller hooks attached to the side for this purpose.  For large worms, thread a single worm along the hook until the hook is mostly or completely hidden.  For very large worms, pierce the hook through several points of the body. Leave a length at the end to wriggle and attract fish.;  , Many fish feed on minnow, but make sure you pick a size appropriate for your target fish to eat. Ask at the bait shop what kind of local fish your target eats, too.  If you are dragging the bait behind you in a moving boat (trolling), hook the fish under its jaw and exit through the top, or just through its upper jaw for especially large bait fish. Alternatively, you can hook it through both nostrils. Any of these hook methods will maximize the fish's ability to swim with a natural motion to attract predator fish.For fishing while still or moving slowly, hook the bait fish on its back just in front of the dorsal fin. Hook it underneath the spine to avoid paralyzing it. This forces the fish to swim more frantically and head-downwards, attracting attention. You can fine tune the depth by placing it further ahead of the dorsal fin; this causes it to swim at a shallower downward angle.  If you are freelining (fishing while stationary, using no floats or weights), you can hook the bait near the tail to make it swim forward. To force it to swim downward instead, hook into the mouth and exit through the gills., Fish that are attracted to crayfish bait include smallmouth bass, catfish, and walleye.  Thread the hook shallowly through the back or front of the crayfish, pushing it out again on the same side. Don't go any deeper than necessary to get under the main shell segment, or you may kill the crayfish.  Alternatively, thread the hook through the meaty tail. This can hide most of the hook and will not hit any of the crayfish's vital organs. Start at the end of the tail and push the hook out just before the body.  Shrimp are a common, cheap bait that many inshore fish varieties feed on, including redfish, jacks, and grouper.These are similar in anatomy to crayfish, but you may need to use a thinner hook for small varieties.  Hook shallowly through the body or through the meat of the tail.  Remove a few segments of shell so the shrimp scent is stronger.  During the summer when insects are plentiful, fishermen can simply catch adults from the ground or young nymphs from under the water surface to guarantee bait that's part of the local fish diet. Trout are especially attracted to insects.Insects should be handled carefully, as they area easily killed while baiting.  Tie a flexible thin wire to the shank of the hook, then wrap it carefully around the insect to affix it to the hooked section.  If you can't affix it with wire, hook through the rear section of the body. The vital organs are mostly in the front and should be avoided. It doesn't matter which direction the insect is facing.  ","use worms and mealworms when in doubt. use minnow as a general purpose bait fish or specialize with another variety. hook certain species with crayfish. use shrimp when saltwater fishing near the shore. bait freshwater fish with insects.

"Observe other brainy girls carefully. What do you like about them? What do you dislike about them? Make a list of the pros and cons before you consider the change.;  , Studies have shown that medium length hair is perceived as intelligent. If your hair is medium length, you can neatly braid it, wear it down and natural or put it in a neat looking bun. If you would prefer to keep it long, that is okay, but, you should make sure it's clean and neat. Whatever your style, make sure it doesn't take too long to manage. You will want to spend more time learning and less time standing in front of the mirror. Keep it natural looking and avoid excessive hair product (including dye, except in a natural colour). A small leather headband is good too.  Cotton polo shirts, T-shirts with the names of museums or with university logos on them, plain and tailored looking pants, knee-length and above the knee skirts and clean, neat, clean-cut and sensible leather shoes/sandals are all nice. Navy blue, plaids and brown also look nice, but don't do it every day. Avoid trends and flashy clothes. Dress modestly. Don't show too much skin.  No glitter or shine. Imitate the makeup of women of stature. Look for inspiration from fashion websites that address makeup for working women, and only use makeup in that section. You don't have to wear any makeup if you don't want to. Avoid excessive piercings.  Sometimes it makes people seem more intelligent, especially rectangle and rounded frames. Keep them clean. Thick frames are especially good. However, if you don't need them, don't be pretentious.  , Start to study very hard and keep trying to raise your grades. Ask your teachers what you can do for extra credit. Your teachers in high school will write recommendations for you for college. Keep that in mind! Become a 'do-er' at school which means win the science fair, run for office or organize the school dance. Write good articles for the school newspaper.  Many teens show, or pretend to have, a very negative or bored attitude about high school and working hard. They think it is 'cool' to be indifferent. Be the opposite. If you don't take delight in school, why waste your time? You are there to learn.  Keep all your work/books/supplies in one place, along with a desk and a strong desk light. Insist on peace and quiet from other family members. If it is too loud at home, study at the public library. Organising your schoolwork and making lists helps you, not just in school, but in life.  Try to raise money and awareness for worthy causes such as 'Stop Hunger in Africa' or 'Cure Childhood Cancer'. You will also feel like a better person for it.  It will give you much-needed focus and make you more relaxed. Eat protein sources: egg white, tuna fish, chicken, power bars, etc. Try out for a good team sport like soccer or something you enjoy. Get good at it and enjoy it. Attend sports camps in the summer for at least 2 weeks. Try to jog, slowly building up to 5 kilometres (3 miles) a day to help your endurance. Also run stairs if you can to build up your leg muscles. A great side benefit is how thin you will stay or become and you will feel great about yourself. Also working out at a gym can build strength and confidence.  Ask if she will 'mentor' you during school.  It's much easier to get things done if you clearly outline to yourself exactly what it is that you need to do.  College admissions look at the High School you went to, your transcripts (grades and SAT scores), your teacher/counselor recommendations and what you tell them in your essays about yourself. Finish college applications early when you are a Senior.  Discover interesting things to do with your close friends and when you are by yourself. Try to pick a music, a sport, a craft, and anything else you love.  It will leave you more room for fun. Figure out where you are losing too much time in your day and fix it.  Work at becoming steady and confident. Try to some have composure at all times. Giggling, gossiping and insecurity make you look silly. Practice staying calm under pressure and being comfortable in a variety of settings.  Have your planner out, then put your pencil case on top in front of you.

"Theatre kids are known for being themselves and not caring about the judgment of others.  While that is certainly not true of everyone, acceptance of themselves is a goal that theatre kids work towards. You can be any height, weight, do your hair however you’d like- diversity is key. Because theatre kids strive to be themselves, they do not feel pressured to wear designer clothes or popular mall labels. It is the art that matters, so when it comes to clothes they are like any other kids. While preppy certainly isn’t the norm, you won’t be judged if you dress like it as long as you don’t have the stereotypical prep attitude that many attribute to that style.  Comfort, in a presentable and laid back way, is key because much of the time you will be in rehearsal or in a class perfecting your craft. T shirts, jeans, converse, dance pants, flats- things like this. It’s not to say theatre girls don’t love heels, they do, but it’s just not convenient for rehearsal. Outside of the theater though, they are just like every other kid.  Also, it is unappreciated by true theatre kids when others try to be accepted into the group just because they dress in a stereotypical manner. Theatre kids don’t all wear cartoon or comic tees or shirts with “witty” sayings, in fact, few do. These ideas only came about because the negative stereotype is “weird.” Also, you will not be accepted as a theatre kid just because you wear the shirt from your favorite musical. They don’t care how much you like “Wicked,” it is the dedication they want to see.;  , Well, not literally. But hey, if you feel like it, do it. Like I said in the step above, theatre kids work at being themselves. If you feel like being a bit crazy, be crazy, and if you feel like sitting by yourself with your iPod or reading a book- you can do that too. As far as literally singing, theatre kids do that =) Feel free, be loud, sound pretty, sound awful; it’s great stress relief. While it’s true that many theatre kids do love musicals and classic music like the Beatles, everyone is different. So while you may find some who shun the mainstream radio, you’ll find just as many who love it and many in-between. Just be prepared that theatre kids love diversity in their music, do not judge their tastes. If you don’t like it, don’t listen.  It is extremely apparent when you are not committed. Many kids who do theatre, in your school for instance, may have other interests; maybe some terms they do sports after school instead of the play. It's perfectly fine to do that, but the amount you are committed to either activity is what will distinguish you as a 'theatre kid' or as a really good friend' of the theatre kids.  For many, it does not come easily and it takes many failures to find a success. You need to learn to see the value in small successes so you don't feel discouraged because rejection will happen. You need to have a sense of 'This is what I love and I will not give up.' Many theatre kids struggle with self worth because it is such a demanding and competitive activity. Just do your best, be happy, and you will find friends and things to be proud of.  It's hypocritical. Just because someone does sports and not theatre does not make them a bad person or unworthy of your time. Accept other's passion as you wish they would accept yours.  If you're in a show, talk about it! Don't be shy!  ","look the part: one of the best things about being a theatre kid is that you can look the way you want. sing everywhere you go!, find your dedication to the arts: the core group of theatre kids are those who have found their passion in the art and are tirelessly devoting themselves to it. be willing to try to fail...and try to fail again: theatre, as an art, is difficult. don't judge others: theatre kids often feel judged by other groups, so don't turn around and do it too. ''talk about what you're doing!'' "
"Your body generally needs more protein when you are psychologically stressed. Stress can cause the death of cells and tissues, so your body needs an increased amount of protein to repair this damage. In addition to this, tryptophan, another protein, is needed to make serotonin, which is a chemical your body releases that makes you feel happy.  Protein-rich foods include poultry, fish, meats like beef and pork, nuts, eggs, beans, peas, and soy products like tofu.The amount of protein you should eat is roughly 0.8 to 1.0 gram (0.03 to 0.04 oz) per kilogram of healthy body weight per day.  Serotonin is a chemical that acts as a neurotransmitter and is a hormone that can help you to feel relaxed. Carbohydrates prompt your brain to produce serotonin. There are two types of carbohydrates—the simple and the complex. Simple carbohydrates are digested quickly and contain refined sugars and few vitamins and minerals. Complex carbs and help you to feel full for longer, which means you will feel less inclined to snack (which many people do when they are stressed).  Sources of complex carbohydrates include whole grain breads and pasta, beans and legumes, and starchy vegetables like sweet potatoes., Stress may weaken the immune system and increases the body’s antioxidant requirement. The commonly known antioxidants are Vitamin C, E and beta carotene. These antioxidants fight free radicals that can form in your body when you are stressed.  Good sources of vitamin C are citrus fruits, kiwi, papaya, green peppers, cabbage, spinach, broccoli, kale, cantaloupe and strawberries.  Vitamin E on the other hand is found mainly in germ oils of wheat, corn, cottonseed and soybean and fish oils, nuts and apricots.  Beta carotene, which is a precursor of vitamin A, is present in milk, butter, egg yolk, liver, spinach, grains and yellow and orange fruits and vegetables.  Caffeine has a half life of four to six hours which means that it will take its full effect after six hours have passed. Because of this, it is important to avoid drinking caffeine after 2 PM, or else you could have a hard time falling asleep, which in turn could make you more stressed the next day. Caffeine can also take an effect on the following hormones, which in turn can make you feel stressed:  Adenosine: Caffeine can inhibit your body’s absorption of adenosine, which calms the body. While this may make you feel alert in the short run, it can cause problems with your sleep cycle later.  Adrenaline: Caffeine pumps adrenaline into your system, giving you a temporary boost, but making you fatigued and depressed later. If you take more caffeine to counteract these effects, you end up spending the day in an agitated state, and might find yourself jumpy and edgy by the time night comes around.  Cortisol: Caffeine can increase the body’s levels of cortisol. Cortisol is the “stress hormone”, which, as the name suggests, can make you feel very stressed.  Dopamine: Caffeine increases dopamine levels in your system, acting in a way similar to amphetamines, which can make you feel good for a short period of time. However, after the caffeine wears off, you may feel “low”.  ","eat more protein. consume complex carbohydrates. up your intake of fresh fruits and vegetables. limit your caffeine intake. "

"The goal of the game is for players to use math in order to capture their opponent's dice - whoever captures all of their opponent's dice first is the winner of the game. In order to capture dice, there are two mathematical 'attacks' that can be used:  Mind Attack: To use the Mind Attack, players must make a mathematical calculation using the numbers on the dice that have been rolled. For example, if they want to steal their opponent's die with an 8 on it, they must use their own dice to make a calculation that will add up to 8, such as 1 + 2 + 5. Depending on the math abilities of the players, subtraction, multiplication, and/or division can be used as well.  Strength Attack: No mathematical calculations are required to use Strength Attack; instead, players simply need to play a dice with the same or higher value as the one they want to capture. For example, if they want to steal their opponent's die with an 8 on it, they must play one of their own dice with either an 8 or a higher number.;  , Maths Warrior is played with 12 dice of different sides (6 dice per player), as well as a flat game board. A small red chip is also used. The dice that will be needed include:  Two 4-sided dice  Two 6-sided dice  Two 8-sided dice  Two 10-sided dice  Two 12-sided dice  Two 20-sided dice  , On the 6, 8, 10, 12, and 20-sided dice, there is only one number on each face, so when those dice are rolled, the number facing the top is the number used. However, on the 4-sided dice, there are 3 numbers on each face, and each number is facing a different direction. When this dice is rolled, the number that is on the bottom of the face is used (this will be the only number in the correct direction - the other numbers will be upside-down)., This chip is known as the 'Penalty Chip', meaning that the owner of the chip can have their Strength Attack blocked by the other player. This chip is typically used in the last round of play when each player only has one die left (and therefore Strength Attacks are the only possible move to win). If the Penalty Chip is used, the dice are not re-rolled and the other player can immediately take their turn, use a Strength Attack, and win the game., Basic Maths Warrior strategy is to try to attack your opponent's dice with the most sides first (since these have bigger numbers and have a better chance of winning Strength Attacks against you), and to try and use a bunch of lower numbers to attack rather than using one big number (this way you can re-roll your lower numbers to try and get bigger numbers to use next time)., Have the two players sit across from each other at a table or a desk. Give six dice to each player (one 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 20-sided die each), and place the game board in the middle of the desk between the two players. Place the red chip in the middle of the game board for now., To begin the game, have both players roll all of their dice and arrange them on the game board in descending order (from biggest to smallest). Whichever player has the smallest die will make the first move, and also gets the Penalty Chip, which can now be moved from the game board to beside this player. If both players have the same smallest number, they now have to compare their second-smallest number to see who will start first and get the Penalty Chip., The player who had the smaller number can now capture one of their opponent's dice using a Mind or Strength attack. Once they have captured a dice, they remove that dice from the game board and keep it beside them (this die can no longer be used in game play). They then re-roll any of their own dice that they used to capture the opponent's die and place them back on the game board in order. Once this is done, the next player may take their turn. This process repeats itself until all of the dice have been captured.  ","understand the objective of the game. gather the materials. know how to read the dice. understand the role of the red chip. remember the game strategy. set up the game. roll and arrange the dice. use mind attacks or strength attacks to steal the opponent's dice.

"If you're going to do interval training of any intensity, warming up your muscles and your cardiovascular system is essential if you want to avoid cramps or other injuries.For brief interval training, five to ten minutes is enough time to warm up. Good warm-ups include a brief jog or jumping rope. You also can jog in place or just do jumping jacks for a few minutes.  Dynamic stretching will warm up your body effectively while also stretching all muscle groups so that your whole body is ready for intervals. Follow up your five-minute warm-up with five minutes of dynamic stretching.To organize your dynamic stretching routine, think of going from your head down to your feet. Start by doing head circles, then move down to shoulder circles, then arm circles, and so on.  Do leg circles while standing, being sure to do them with your knees bent as well as straight. You can also do these while lying on your back if you are having problems with balance.  Aerobic exercises are those that engage your cardiovascular system. Anaerobic activities are those in which you remain relatively stationary, such as lifting weights.Make a list of the exercises you want to include in your routine, and label them as aerobic or anaerobic. Then, set up your routine so that you are doing an aerobic exercise followed by an anaerobic exercise followed by another aerobic exercise.  For example, you might start with scissor jumps, then do weight lifting or static stretches, then do burpees.  Especially if weight loss is one of your exercise goals, alternating high intensity and low intensity can increase your metabolism and get your body to burn excess fat, even after you've finished your workout for the day.Your low-intensity periods should be longer than your high-intensity periods. For example, if you're doing low-intensity exercise for one-minute intervals, you should follow up with a high-intensity exercise for 30 seconds.  Since interval training typically does not include rest periods between exercise intervals, working alternate muscle groups allows the muscles you just worked to recover.This can be difficult if you have a lot of whole-body exercises in your routine, but think about what muscles are most targeted by the exercise. For example, if you're doing planks, this is a whole-body exercise that primarily targets the core. Mountain climbers also target the core, so you wouldn't want to follow up a plank interval with an interval of mountain climbers.  To build an effective interval routine yourself, you need to think of what you want to accomplish through your workouts and then look for exercises that will help you achieve those goals.Scissor jumps are an effective whole-body exercise that will help increase your overall fitness, including your cardiovascular fitness. If your goal is simply to become more physically fit, you should incorporate scissor jumps into your routine.  If you want to lose weight around your midsection and build strong abdominal muscles, you want to include core exercises such as planks and mountain climbers as well.  If you're new to exercise, work with a personal trainer to build your routine, or search online for free instructional videos of interval routines.  If you've decided to start doing high-intensity interval training, you need to be aware of the toll it takes on your body. Although this is a quick and efficient way to improve your fitness, you must allow enough time for your body to recover.Typically you don't want (or need) to do more than one or two high-intensity interval sessions each week.  Leave at least 48 hours of recovery time between high-intensity sessions.  ","include an effective warm-up. do some dynamic stretching. alternate aerobic and anaerobic activities. set periods of high intensity and low intensity. avoid working the same muscle groups back-to-back. include a variety of exercises with different goals. limit your high-intensity sessions.

"A person can develop a fear of snakes if he or she has personally been threatened; has witnessed a threatening event; or has 'learned' to fear snakes for any reason. This fear can be learned from popular film and television, books, social media, or even word-of-mouth. Regardless of the reason, this fear is the result of an individual having been 'conditioned' to feel fear in the presence of snakes. That is, this fear is not natural, but instead, 'learned.'Most of these fears generate during an individual's childhood.  A therapist will help you to 'unlearn' these fears.;  , What is it about them that scares you? What do you think about them? Try describing them... It may turn-out that are have some misconceptions about snakes.  Knowing what specifically caused your fear of snakes will help you better overcome your fear. Were you simply misinformed about the behavior of snakes? Do you hate they way they look? Have you been bitten?  A person who has been traumatized by a personal experience may need to undergo counseling before seeking out any type of exposure therapy.  Most cases of 'ophidiophobia' are caused by misinformation and popular media.Knowing exactly why you are afraid of snakes can help you overcome your fear., You should learn as much as you can about whatever scares you.In this case, begin with your list and being researching facts about snakes. Are your assumptions correct? Are your fears justified?  If you have learned to fear snakes from popular media or word of mouth, you will need to unlearn these fears by researching hard facts.

In extreme cases, many hours of conditioning therapy may be required before starting any exposure therapy.  This may be very difficult at first, so be sure to begin with the most non-threateing type of toy snake that you can find. A stuffed animal will more-than-likely present less of a threat to a person with ophidiophobia than a rubber replica that looks like the real thing., Once you feel comfortable with handling a toy snake--and the idea of potentially handling a living one--track down an article of clothing made from an actual snake's skin.Run your fingertips over the texture and pay attention to the scales.  How does the skin feel? Does it feel as you expected?  Try to imagine a living snake moving against your skin.  If you have a friend that keeps a pet as a snake, this will be easy. If not, try visiting your local pet store to see if they have any snakes for sale. No, you will not be buying one; but will instead be watching safely from the other side of the glass. If you have a zoo near you, try visiting their reptile exhibit.  Pay attention to the snake's movements.  If the snake is coiled-up, it may be cold and trying to maintain its body temperature.  You will also be able to watch them interact with one another in conditions that more resemble nature.  The animal handler will be able to answer any questions you may have about snakes.  Be prepared to see a variety of snakes.  Only get as close to the snake as you feel comfortable.

"To fish successfully in ESO, you will need to collect bait. There are various types of bait that can be found around the world of Tamriel. For the best success in fishing, you will need to use the correct bait for each of the four water types. You can also purchase simple bait from merchants that can be used everywhere, but it isn’t perfectly suited for any type of water.;  , Nearly every body of water in ESO has a fishing hole. You can identify a fishing hole by finding a large ripple in the water.  You will automatically begin the game with a fishing rod, but bait must be collected in-game.  There are four different types of water in Elder Scrolls Online: lakes, rivers, foul water, and oceans. The appearance of each water type is self-explanatory, although if you find a fishing hole that you’re unsure of, you can use simple bait to catch a fish first. You can use the details below to identify the body of water you are in:  Lakes include Spadetail, Silverside Perch, and Shad.  Oceans include Dhufish, Longfin, and Minnows.  Rivers include Salmon, River Betty, and Fish Roe.  Foul water includes Slaughterfish, Trodh, and Chub.  To start fishing, simply tap “E” on a fishing hole. Your character will show an idle fishing animation as he fishes.  Whilst you can use simple bait for all four water types, your chance of catching better rewards is improved with the right bait. You can choose between collected bait by holding down the “E” key instead of tapping “E” whilst at a fishing hole.If you are fishing in a lake you can use Guts or Minnows. Guts can be collected by killing and looting small passive mobs such as rats and frogs. Minnows can be fished for in oceans.  If you are fishing in an ocean you can use Worms and Chub. Worms can be looted from undead corpses or from interacting with alchemy plants found throughout Tamriel. Chub can be fished from foul water.  If you are fishing in a river you can use Shad or Insect Parts. Shad can be fished from lakes. Insect Parts can be collected when interacting with torchbugs or butterflies, which are both found flying in the air throughout Tamriel.  If you are fishing in Foul Water you can use Fish Roe or Crawlers. Fish Roe can be fished from rivers. Crawlers can be collected by killing and looting passive spiders or from interacting with alchemy plants found throughout Tamriel.  While fishing, you’ll need to watch for visual cues for when to press the E key to reel in any catches. As soon as you see your character tugging your fishing rod, you can reel in the line to catch a fish. If you reel in before the tugging animation, you will leave the fishing activity without catching anything.  The average waiting time for catching a fish is just a few seconds.  ","collect bait. find a fishing hole. identify the fishing hole. start the fishing process. choose the right bait. reel in the catch! "
"One of the biggest questions people have is when (how long into the relationship) they should tell their significant other that they love them. This, though, varies from men to women. One study has noted that men take 88 days to tell their girlfriends that they love them, while women take significantly longer. As a result of this, you need to make sure that you’re not rushing the relationship:  Make sure she’s sent signals to you that she feels the same, even if she hasn’t told you that she loves you.  Don’t tell her you love her during the first couple of weeks of dating. This is far too soon, and inappropriate. While there may be some couples who are sure of their love so early on, chances are, it’s not you.  If it feels too early, it probably is too early to tell her you love her. Wait a bit longer. If she feels the same way, it can’t hurt to wait a little bit.;  , Perhaps the best time to tell her you love her is when you feel comfortable in your relationship and want to move it to the next level. There is no specific timeline on this, and it varies from relationship to relationship, so you need to gauge your own relationship and your comfort level before telling her you love her., Telling her that you love her is not something you want to rush. You need to wait for an appropriate moment in which you’ll be able to express yourself and she’ll be able to respond. While you want to wait for an appropriate moment, consider:  That there is no “perfect” moment. If you’re waiting for the perfect moment, you might wait forever.  Don’t tell her when her complete attention is not on you.  Don’t tell her when you’re in the process of coming into contact with other people.  Consider a natural pause in the conversation after she’s said something sweet to you. This way, your admission of love will be a reciprocation of her own feelings., Letting her know that you love her should be something you tell her when you’re alone. This doesn’t mean that you have to be completely isolated from everyone when you tell her, but you certainly want to have at least a low level of intimacy between the two. Consider:  Never tell her in front of a group of friends.  Don’t tell her when you are in front of your or her family.  Generally, the less people the better. If you’re alone talking in a crowd, that’s okay. But if you’re the center of attention in the crowd, that might be a bit awkward for one or both of you.  If at all possible, you should let her know about how you feel in a natural way. While you’re going to probably think about doing it ahead of time, try not to script it out word for word and time it to the exact minute. It will come across as more sincere if it seems natural., The best time to say “I love you” is when you’re sober and alert. There are a number of reasons for this. If you’re not sober and alert, you might botch the delivery. If you’re drunk or tired, your girlfriend might question your motives or think that you don’t really mean what you’re saying.  Don’t be drunk and say “I love you.” Of course, a glass of wine or a beer should be alright (if you’re of age).  Don’t say “I love you” after you’ve been partying.  The more alert you are, the chances are the better you’ll be able to convey your true feelings., Some men prefer to give their girlfriend a gift, present it, and then tell their lady how much she means to him. This is certainly an acceptable way of conveying your love. However, consider:  Inexpensive thoughtful gifts that are homemade or represent something in your relationship.  A necklace or bracelet (if you know she’s been interested in something like this).  It might come off as contrived.  Don’t make your gift too grandiose, because it could seem like you are trying to buy her.  Try not to make a spectacle out of presenting the gift, this could be embarrassing.  Only you know your relationship dynamic, so use your best judgement based on both of your comfort levels and expectations.  Telling your girlfriend you love her is something you don’t want to overthink. If you overthink it, it might come off awkward or contrived. Instead, trust your feelings and your intuition. If it feels like the right moment to tell her you love her, then do it., A romantic dinner is a wonderful place to tell your girlfriend that you love her. It’ll set the atmosphere, give you both time to talk and enjoy each other’s company, and give you the opportunity to tell her.  A nice restaurant that you both enjoy will work great.  Consider a home cooked meal.  If cooking at home, try to set the meal apart from everyday meals you might already enjoy together. If appropriate, light a candle and put on some lite music.  Picnics are a nice of way of spending time together with an atmosphere that suggests intimacy but is not too suggestive. Chances are, you’ll both enjoy the picnic, and use it as a time to talk and bond more than you have already. It might create the perfect opportunity to give her your news., Perhaps you want to let her know in the heat of the moment – when you’re kissing or making out. This works for some people, but there are some potential pitfalls you need to be careful about.  Don’t expect sex. She could think that you are saying it in order to butter her up for sex.  Don’t tell her during sex. This could come off as insincere.  Don’t tell her immediately after sex. Instead, wait a few hours at minimum, or even a couple of days.  Make sure it comes out naturally, and not as some grand sexual plan for the evening., There are a number of reasons why you should avoid entertainment venues for this sort of thing. Most importantly, her attention won’t be on you. But there are other reasons as well:  You both might be under the scrutiny of others, which could be awkward.  If she’s a private person, she might be mad that you shared such a big thing with the whole world.  Only you know your relationship and your significant other, so use your best judgement.  If you’re both over-the-top, out-going, and flamboyant personalities, then maybe you can consider a grandiose moment to tell her you love her. While this is not recommended for most people, it might be right for you – but ultimately, only you know your relationship and your significant other. If you are the type of person who wants to do this, consider:  Hiring a plane trailing a sign “I love you <name>” over a sporting event or some other event where you and your girlfriend will be outside.  Sending her dozens of roses with a card that says I love you. If you want to go really over the top, you can send this to her work. It might be inappropriate, though.  There are many other over-the-top ways of conveying your love, just make sure you think it’s right for your relationship., If you think it’s the right time and place, just tell her directly, “I love you.” This is extremely direct, but it’s simple and it will convey what you are feeling. Of course there are a few ways to slightly soften this direct approach:  Say something like “I have a confession to make…” then “I love you.”  Ask her for her hand, and tell her you love her.  Lead into a conversation about how you see the rest of your life, and then tell her you love her.  You can tell her you love her in an indirect approach, if you feel more comfortable doing so. However, be warned. While this might alleviate some of the stress and anxiety for you, it might take some of the magic out of the moment. If you do go with the indirect approach, consider:  Spelling “I love you” on a mirror or another surface.  Sending her flowers with a card that says “I love you.”  Write her a “love letter” and snail mail it to her.  Understand that an indirect approach could be construed as a grandiose admission of love, too. , Sharing your love in a nonverbal way is something many people do. There are pros and cons to this approach. First, a nonverbal signal of love might mean more than just mere words. However, it could also lack the force and emotion of a direct verbal approach. If you’re going to go nonverbal, consider:  Looking into her eyes at the right moment. If you have a true connection, she’ll understand.  Holding her and kissing her on the neck at the right moment and at the right place. Perhaps you’re on a beach watching the sunset. This action might say much more than words could communicate.  Be warned that this approach might be considered a cop-out by some, and might not actually communicate what you want. Only you and your partner can know.  ","time your moment based on how long you’ve been in the relationship. tell her when you feel the relationship is solid, you are connected, and you want to move to the next level. wait for the appropriate (specific) moment. wait until the two of you are alone. let it be natural. make sure you are sober and alert. accompany it with a gift. trust your gut. invite her to a romantic dinner. invite her on a picnic. tell her when you’re engaged in light intimacy at one of your homes. avoid telling her at sports events, parties, or movies. consider a grandiose moment, if you think it’s appropriate. tell her directly, at the right time and the right place. let her know indirectly. communicate your love nonverbally.

"Each shotgun shell consists of five basic components, somewhat less complex than the materials available for reloading brass.To reload empty shot shells, you'll need:  Empty hulls, checked for wear  Plastic wadding of the appropriate gauge  Shot of the desired 'shot number'  Primers  Shotshell powder  , The only reusable component of the shotgun shell is the plastic shell itself, what is ejected from the shotgun after firing a round. To find reusable hulls, look for signs of wear around the mouth of the shell. They should be relatively uniform, rounded and intact plastic casings to reload.  Hold potential reload hulls up to the light and examine the mouth of each for splits and substantial wear along the crimping. If it's too torn up, you won't be able to use it to properly crimp back down, resulting in a faulty shell.  Generally, it's a good idea to throw away shells that have been stepped on or jammed with mud in some way. Shells that come from break-open shotguns that allow you to remove the empty shells directly from the gun are your safest bet. Put them directly into a box or bag to keep them, if you want to reload.  When you fit the empty shell into the slot on your reloader, the first step is relatively simple. Pull the lever, and the uncapping pin will remove the spent cap from the empty shell, also resizing the casing to proper specifications. If the shell has warped some in transport, this step should round it back out some.  The safest way to make sure that you're reloading your shells to the proper specifications is to consult a trusty reload guide like the Alliant Guide. Included will be a rundown of powder weights, shot types, and primers used in all brands and varieties of shells. If you're planning on reloading regularly, it's essential to invest in one of these guides.  Each reloader will work differently, so you might check your owner's manual from your reloading press for a proper guide.  Most reload guides call for Red Dot shotshell powder for use in reloading, of a varying amount.12 ga. shells are usually loaded with between 16 and 25 grains of powder.  Most reloaders have a rotating plate that allows you to keep a load of each necessary 'ingredient' queued up, allowing you to work relatively quickly. To advance between the steps, you simply rotate the plate and pull the handle again. You can go as quickly as you can do that simple action.  Rotate the plate again and use the lever to insert your plastic wadding and the appropriate amount of sized shot for your variety of shell.  You've got some choice in the matter when it comes to what shot you want to load your shells with, depending on your purposes. 12 gauge shells generally use size 7.5, 8, or 9 size shot, sold in big 25 pound bags. The smaller the number, the larger the little lead balls. If you're shooting for sport, 8 or 9 is generally better, while you might want size 7.5 if you're hunting or reloading for some other purpose.  Rotate the reloader again to crimp the shells closed, securing the completed shell. Store them in shotshell trays, widely available at sporting goods stores or other outlets, or just put them back in the old boxes that the shells came in.  If you've altered the shells in any way--using different sizes of shot or made other manual-approved modifications--make note of it on the box so you know what you're shooting.  ","assemble the necessary materials. check your empty shells for reusable hulls. deprime your shells. consult a reload guide for load sizes. rotate the shell plate to load the shell with primer and powder. seat the wadding and the shot. crimp the shell.

"Set the bottom of the cupcake down onto the center of a plate.  This technique works best for un-frosted cupcakes and cupcakes that have very little frosting since the jam can be used to add more flavor. You can also use it for heavily-frosted cupcakes, but be aware of the fact that it can result in an even messier—albeit, tastier—treat.  Note that this method works with standard cupcakes but not with filled cupcakes.  Hold the cupcake steady with your non-dominant hand, grasping the cake portion with your thumb and forefinger near the top of the cupcake. Use a plastic knife or other dull kitchen knife to slice the cupcake in half, separating the top from the bottom.  Set the top half aside as you work with the bottom half. Place the top half on your plate cut-side-down.  You could tear the cupcake in half as you would do with the sandwich method, but cutting it in half is preferable for this method because it creates a smoother, more even division.  Use a dull kitchen knife to smear a thin layer of flavored jam, honey, hazelnut spread, or other similar spread onto the cut-side of the bottom layer.  You can use a thicker layer of spread, but a thicker layer is more likely to squirt out from the sides of the cupcake as you eat it.  Place the top half of the cupcake back onto the lower half, reconnecting the two cut sides. Press down on the top half slightly to secure it in place, relying on the jam to adhere the halves together.  Eat the cupcake by biting into as you would bite a sandwich.

Herbs that grow in the shade tend to have a less bitter taste and a longer growing period, meaning you will have access to these herbs for longer throughout the year., These herbs do well in light to partial shade. You can grow them in pots in the shade and move them to sunny areas periodically if they start to wilt., These herbs can handle the shade. You can also try growing lesser known herbs like angelica, chervil, costmary, lovage, sweet flag, and sweet woodruff.  If you have a cat at home and are looking for a cheap, healthy treat for your cat, try growing catnip in the shade. Catnip is easy to grow and maintain in a backyard garden with light to partial shade.

"Breath in as deeply as you can, hold, and let out the air as slowly as you can; repeat 5 times or until you are calm.;  ,  Now imagine you just finishing your speech and all of your peers or coworkers clapping, impressed by your wise words.

"Summer is the time for light, ephemeral scents, while in winter, you can go for heavier scents. Scents fade faster in colder months (because your skin is so dry), so picking a heavier scent will help it stick with you for longer., The base notes of a fragrance are more important in the winter months. Perfumes consist of top notes, middle notes, and base notes. The base notes are the heaviest part of the fragrance, the part the lingers, while top notes fade quickly. Patchouli, vanilla, and sandalwood are common base notes you'll find more regularly in winter perfumes.To figure out the base notes of colognes, you can talk to the people at the perfume counter, who will be glad to assist you. You can also research perfumes online to find out more.  In the winter months, you may need to move to a slightly denser scent.Eau de cologne is only about 5 percent scent, while eau de parfum is about 15 to 18 percent. Perfume is can go up to 30 percent scent, though it can also be as low as 15. The key is, you want something stronger in the winter, as most scents won't have as much punch as they did in the summer., Winter is filled with cold weather and lots of sweet flavors, such as your favorite Christmas cake. When you're picking a fragrance, picking one that reminds you of those desserts is a sure-fire way to pick something appropriate. Gourmand fragrances fall into this category, as they are quite sweet and are often reminiscent of all things sugary.Some gourmand perfumes to try are Salted Caramel by Shay and Blue, Candy by Prada, or Le Petite Robe Noire by Guerlain.  Spicy scents are ones that fall into the 'warm' category. Think about your favorite winter spices, such as cinnamon, nutmeg, and cardamom. These scents are also known as Orientals, and usually have a rich, exotic smell.Shalimar by Guerlain is a classic example of this type of scent.  Woody and earthy scents are also a good choice for winter because they have a rich, heavy scent, reminiscent of pine trees and burning wood. Bergamot, patchouli, oakmoss, and labdanum are all in this category. You may find they are paired with something citrusy.Hypnose by Lancome is a perfume in this category.  If winter is not your favorite, you can simply use your scent to remind yourself of better days ahead (in the summer). Choose something sweet and floral, or simply pick something that reminds you of summer. That way, every time you spray it, you'll be transported back to warm summer days.To make the scent more wintery, pick a floral with a deeper, more intense scent, that has a base of jasmine or tuberose, for instance.Vera Wang's Princess is a good example of this type of scent., Sometimes, visiting the perfume counter can be overwhelming. To help you narrow down what you might like, try taking an online fragrance-finder quiz. That way, you'll have a place to start when you get to the store.You can find a fragrance quiz by doing a simple search, but many major perfume websites also have them.  You can also test out samples that come in magazines or ask people you know what their scent is if you like it.  When you go to the store, you want a blank canvas, so to speak. Skip putting on any perfume that morning so it won't compete. Also, skip other items you use with strong scents, such as lotions and body washes., The first step to testing a perfume is spraying it on a card. Smell it when you first spray it, but also try smelling it again in about 5 minutes, once it's had time to dry and settle. If you like it both times, you can move on to the next test.Often, perfume counters will have coffee beans on the counter to help you clear out your nostrils. Take a good whiff between scents to help clear your palate, so to speak.  Next, try it out on your skin. You may wonder why you have to smell it both on a card and your skin. However, each perfume interacts with your skin and body chemistry, giving it a unique scent, different from every other person who wears it. Therefore, you want to make sure you like the smell on yourself before you buy it.Consider leaving it on for a few hours before buying it. You may find you don't like it after having it on for a while.  ","go heavy. pay attention to base notes. pick an eau de parfum or perfume instead of cologne. think dessert. consider a spicy scent. try woody. go rogue with a summery scent. try a fragrance quiz. skip applying fragrances before you go shopping. spray it on a card. spray it on your skin.

"An exterior mount is when you hang your roman shades outside of your window frame, typically by attaching them directly to the wall slightly above the window. Select windows that have a sturdy frame that can bear weight.  Place your blinds above the window frame in the location you want them to hang. Use a carpenters pencil to mark this location on the wall; the edge of the brackets should be flush to the edge of the window frame. Typically the location of these brackets is located about 3-inches in from each edge of the shades, but there may be more based on the overall size of your shades. If there are multiple loose brackets, space them evenly over the top of the shade.  Always check to make sure that your shades are level prior to marking the location of the brackets.  If you prefer, you can simply measure the overall size of the shades and use this measurement to estimate the location of the brackets.  Use the brackets and screws that came with your roman shades for installation. Place each bracket on the marked location on the wall, so that the part that sticks out from the wall is at the top. Use the screws to attach the brackets to the wall; you’ll normally need two screws per bracket. Installation of the brackets will differ slightly between brands of roman shades, so follow the specific directions that came with yours.  The top of the roman shades should have flat brackets that click into place with the brackets you’ve attached to the wall. Carefully slip the roman shades in, so that the brackets at the top click together. Pull on the cord that adjusts the shades, to verify that the shades are secure and functional.  ","choose the location for your mount. find the location for the brackets. install the brackets in the wall. slide your shades into place. "

"Genuine openness often comes naturally when you're in an equal, mutually beneficial partnership. However, even in the best relationships, some people have trouble opening up about what makes them tick or what upsets them, so you may still need to work on getting him to open up gradually over time. But a strong foundation will really help.;  , Lead by example in your relationship; be open and honest with him, and share your feelings calmly, without flying off the handle when you're upset. Your boyfriend may feel that opening up about something upsetting will lead to a big fight or upheaval. Show him that you can handle even the curve balls with grace and a cool head, and he may be reassured that he can open up without drama.  This can be hard in any relationship, especially in the early stages. Building trust takes time, but you can help the process along by being loyal and dedicated to him, not sharing any private information you already know about him with others, and letting him get to know your friends/colleagues and see you interact with them. If you betray his trust now or have done before, he probably will not trust you with anything too personal.  It may be tempting to try 'tricking' your boyfriend into sharing his feelings or experiences with you. However, this doesn't do anything to make your relationship stronger; in fact, it generally hurts your long-term trust. Stay genuine with him instead, and you'll see a big impact over time.  Pick a calm time; don't try to get him to open up during a fight or disagreement; even if he does open up in the heat of 'battle,' it'll be tinged by the strength of emotion at the time, and you may not like what he has to say when he's heated. Instead, work on talking about both your feelings and experiences in a calm moment when you're alone together.  Maybe put your arm around him or snuggle with him; physical touch can be a strong reminder of the bond between you. The focus isn't on making it sensual, which can be distracting or, at the extreme, even manipulative. Only use physical closeness to reflect the warmth between you and provide some comfort during what might be a difficult conversation.  If there's something you want your boyfriend to open up about, you can lead the conversation there. However, you want to avoid coming on too strongly or overwhelming him. Gently change the topic or link the topic to a piece of information you would like to know. Try telling him something personal about yourself and ask him to tell you something in return. Say that you trust him, he is likely to tell you that he trusts you (or he might say he is not sure if he trusts you yet, in which case, try to comfort him and let it go for a while and try again soon.). You could say things like:  'I have always wondered why...'  'I would really like to know...'  'I know you find this hard to talk about but maybe if you shared it with me it would help.'  'I hate that you shut me out of your personal life; I love you and want to help you.'  'Please let me help you...'  , If your lead-in to the conversation doesn't get a good reaction from him, or if he clams up or literally tells you that he doesn't want to talk about it, respect his wishes. Don't push the topic further; just accept that this isn't the right time for him.  Be patient with him and let him tell you in time. The key is be supportive, kind, and patient.  If your boyfriend does start opening up, make it a meaningful moment. Your goal is not just to dig into his secrets; the goal is to have an honest and open talk about the topic at hand. Don't stop talking as soon as he reveals the feelings or details you were hoping to know. Allow him to talk to you and show your interest in what he has to say. If he is uncomfortable talking about something, respect that and don't talk to him about it unless he wants to. Talk to him and comfort him about whatever he says (good or bad).  Since opening up can be uncomfortable, you want to avoid a long list of overwhelming 'interview-style' questions. Don't interrogate him. Focus on listening to his answers and showing interest. That being said, it is okay to ask questions about how events turned out or how it made him feel. Keep talking as long as he seems to want to.  The openness doesn't have to stop as soon as this particular conversation is over. If you feel he has more to share or wants to confide in you more, look for more opportunities in future to talk about the topic again. Don't force it, but encourage him to continue being open (about the same topic or others) in the future, and be supportive of what he shares.  Let him know that he was right to trust you. As tempting as it may be, don't tell your best friends anything he has asked you to keep private.  ","build a strong relationship. work on your own honesty and emotional interactions. show your boyfriend that he can trust you. avoid manipulation. choose a quiet and appropriate time to talk. be close to him. guide the conversation but avoid manipulation. don't force anything or make him uncomfortable. engage in a meaningful conversation. ask good questions without prying. make it an ongoing dialogue. do not abuse his trust by telling anyone.

"Empathy helps you understand someone else’s perspective. Being empathetic is vital for authentic relationships, genuine communication, and problem-solving. Because we are social creatures, we constantly find ourselves in situations where we could be more empathetic (or empathic - the words mean the same thing). Consider these situations:Think about being in line at the grocery store. The cashier is taking forever because he is new to his job. While you may be frustrated, you may also understand that when someone is learning something, they do not go as fast. You might picture yourself as the cashier, who is probably very stressed out that people are frustrated and grumbling. Because you are using empathy, you may decide to be patient and understanding.  Imagine your friend just found out her parents are getting divorced. Maybe your parents are still married and you have no experience with this. But you can consider how it would feel to hear this news, and respond how you imagine you’d like someone to respond to you, if you were in your friend’s shoes. You might say, “I’m so sorry to hear this. How are you doing?”;  , You can’t understand what other people are feeling until you learn and label your own emotions.It isn’t always easy to figure out what you are feeling, though. Here are some basic ways to help identify your feelings:  Talk to someone. Sharing feelings out loud with others helps you get feedback, and also helps you sort through them as you talk.Write in a journal. Write down what’s going through your mind and help process and name your feelings.Think about your thoughts. For example, if you are thinking, “I have so much to do! The house is a mess and company is coming!” you might be feeling stressed out.Carry a list of emotions with you. If you are new to identifying your emotions, then carrying a list of different emotions may help you to identify what you are feeling.  Active listening helps you develop empathy because you are fully listening to the person talking (with your eyes and body language as well as your ears). You will also echo back to the person what you are hearing them say.Be focused on the person talking. Put down your phone or other distractions and point your body in the direction of the speaker. Make eye contact with the person.  Paraphrasing is using your own words to describe what you just heard the other person say. This often helps both of you gain greater understanding.  For example, if your coworker says, “I am never going to get this project done! It is never-ending!” you could say, “Wow, you sound really overwhelmed!”  If you are off-base in your paraphrasing or reflecting back, the speaker will generally let you know with simple disagreement. For example, “No, I think I have control of the project. It just seems like it will never get done!”  , Let the person know how what they are sharing with you makes you feel. This helps you move towards further understanding about how the person is feeling.You can say, “I am so frustrated after hearing this story about your boss.” The other person will likely either agree with your statement (“Yes! She’s driving me crazy!”) or point you more toward how they are truly feeling (“I am so angry after our last meeting”). Either way, you further understand what this person is experiencing and feeling, thus building empathy.  Learning other people’s stories helps us develop empathy for others, because we have been given a glimpse of what it is like to be that person. Human beings seem to be hard-wired to retain and learn from stories.Many powerful stories tend to resonate with us long after they are told.  Listen to other people’s stories.Be curious about people and ask them about their lives. Most of the time, people are willing to share about themselves, particularly if you are engaging in empathic behaviors and active listening.  Read more books. Books help us become more empathic because we are often reading the character’s own thoughts and motivations. For the most empathic bang for your buck, read works of literary fiction, where the relationship dynamics and character psychology are often more developed than other types of books. , Look for common interests with another person. This can be a stepping stone toward a deeper understanding.Maybe there is a new kid at your school who is from another country. You don’t know anything about his culture, but you are both on the tennis team. You could use the common sport as a starting point for conversation. From there you could talk about tennis players from his home country, then how his culture is different from yours.  Sharing your own vulnerabilities helps grown connections.Letting your guard down with someone can inspire them to share their own deeper feelings, where you are more likely to make a connection and build empathy.Sharing deeper feelings needs to be done in an appropriate setting and after some initial connection has been made. Don’t run up to a person on the street and announce you want to share what it was like for you when your mom died. Get to know the person, and share deeper conversations in quieter, private settings--like driving in a car or playing a game one-on-one, not in a noisy arcade or while others may be eavesdropping.  Think of a conversation as a spiral. You start at the outer loop with more superficial conversation. As you progress in your conversation and build empathy with the other person, you move closer in toward the center of the spiral and it becomes more appropriate to share those innermost, core feelings.  Make a connection with the other person’s story. For example, you could say, “When you told me about how you feel like nobody understands you, I got where you were coming from. I feel like that a lot, too. Sometimes I feel like I will never meet anybody who really gets me.”  ","put yourself in someone else’s shoes. identify your own emotions. be an active listener. paraphrase the speaker’s statements. reflect back. collect stories. find common ground. share your story.

"Just as there isn't a clear step-by-step process to win everyone over, there's no one way to dress well. This open-endedness isn't a bad thing. Rather, there are endless possibilities through which you can express yourself. Aim to dress to suit the occasion you're taking part of, whether it's a wedding, funeral, or weekend party. For more general circumstances, it's a good idea to take a look at the clothes you currently wear and ask yourself what kind of impression that would give across to someone who saw you on the street.  You don't need to follow current fashion trends, but it does help to check up some of the more recent styles for inspiration in finding your own look.  This includes making sure your clothes are freshly laundered regularly, especially if you're on the brink of a high-priority meeting like a first date or job interview.;  , Improper sleep has a list of bad effects on you and your body. You'll never be in your best mood without proper rest, and your body will look drained and pale. It's recommended you try to get at least 7 hours of sleep each night. Although this may be difficult to accomplish for some, there are lots of things you can do to improve on your sleep. Avoid caffeine and stay away from electronics in the hour before getting to sleep if you can., Remember to attend to basics. This includes trimming your nails, brushing your hair, brushing your teeth at least twice a day, and showering regularly.  Keeping up with hygiene's especially important if you have a physically strenuous lifestyle.  A solid posture and assertive stance make you naturally look more powerful and reliable. On the other hand, being slouched over will have a negative reaction from whomever sees you like that. Positive body language also has a benefit on your self-confidence.  Smiling is a universal tool for sending positive feelings. There are numerous benefits for both smiling and being smiled at.Don't forget to smile whenever you meet someone for the first time.  Strong eye contact is essential. Make sure you're looking directly at whomever you're talking to.  Even if there's a lot of nagging self-doubt, confidence is necessary if you want to maximize your chances at winning people over. Having a firm belief in yourself is something that goes over well with practically everyone. When you have confidence, other things like charm and collectedness fall into place like clockwork.  Try asking some of your friends some good things they like about you. Even if you find yourself clouded in self-doubt, they'll probably see a much better version of you.  If you think it will help, make up a list of ten things you like about yourself or are proud of. Don't be modest on your list and don't underrate the things you've already accomplished in your life. Once you have a full list of things you have to offer other people, you'll be able to look at it and be reminded of everything you have to offer the world.  Gratitude is a reminder that the person thinks highly of whomever they're talking to and sincerely appreciates all they do. If someone does something for you, make sure to thank them for it. You should always thank someone for their time after meeting them for the first time. Time itself is valuable, and the other person will be made to feel special.  Make sure the way you're expressing gratitude is appropriate to what you're being thankful for. For example, if someone has held open a door for you, a simple 'thank you' usually suffices. On the other hand, if you've recently been offered a great raise by your employer, a more in-depth thank you (such as a written letter) may be more appropriate.  They don't try to hide what they're feeling. Emotional expressiveness also allows you to relate to the other person on more than just a mental level. Don't be afraid to let feeling come into whatever you're talking about. So long as it's kept within appropriate boundaries, everyone likes a person who sounds passionate or moved but the thing they're talking about.  Especially if you're meeting someone, you should probably limit your range of emotions to the positive-leaning end of the spectrum. Coming off as an angry or embittered person isn't likely going to win somebody over.  A lot of research shows that people have a hard time being charmed by those they think are out of their league. A lot of the most charming movie actors have traits that are otherwise completely normal, and this is why they are so appealing.If you want to win someone over, you shouldn't try to give the impression that you're somehow completely better than them. Your best bet is to find common ground. Make yourself relatable to the person they're talking to. Even if you're coming from opposite backgrounds, make it sound like the other person is talking to an equal.  Instead, people tend to feel endeared towards people who aren't afraid to show their weak points. There is a difference between this and dwelling on your failures. People don't like a sob story. You want to show these vulnerabilities while all the while expressing confidence and security. This proves to others that you are bigger than any of your weaknesses.  Any character flaw can improve if you put your heart to it. There is a world of differences between someone who likes to relax and someone lazy. Some good weaknesses, per example, would be being clumsy or having a soft heart towards kitten.  Self-deprecating humour is a good way to express vulnerability without making it seem like you're dwelling on the negative. By turning something touchy into an excuse to make other people laugh, you can show people you're stronger than your insecurities.  Once you've won someone over, it's another thing entirely to keep that relationship healthy and afloat.Making connections takes charm, while keeping them healthy takes trust and understanding. Once you have a bond with someone, it's important to let each other in on the details of your lives as if you were still just getting to know each other. In this way, a friendship or relationship will continue to grow.  If you have won someone over, you can do a lot to make your ties stronger by winning at things together. If there's a contest you're going to take part of, it doesn't hurt to bring this person into it as well.  On the other hand, you can set parallel goals and keep one another accountable for their own. For instance, if the two of you have a weight loss goal, you can keep each other motivated by telling the other how much you've lost and what you're doing to get there.  No doubt it makes you feel a lot better when someone gives you affection. The same works both ways. Make sure to return affection when it's given by someone you care about. This may be a difficult thing to do at first if you're a naturally cold person, but the benefits will be apparent for you as much as the other person. Research shows that people are happier when they regularly express gratitude and affection for people they care about.If affection doesn't come naturally to you, you should try to mirror the affection that's been given to you. For example, if someone smiles, it is generally good form to return the smile.  Make sure you feel the affection as sincerely as the other person does. If you're trying to force returned affection, it will seem like you're being condescending.  Patience is a necessary virtue for practically all relationships. If you've developed a meaningful connection with someone, you'll need to acknowledge that there will be times where communication might be slow.Life events can take their toll on a person, and limit the amount you'll get to see them. Don't take the changes personally. Accept the fact that everyone changes over time, and be patient towards the challenges that may create.  ","dress to impress. get enough sleep. maintain good hygiene.even if you're the best looking person in the room, you're not going to get anywhere if someone doesn't think you care about the way you look. assert yourself through positive body language.body language is a key ingredient in getting people to like you without having to open up your mouth. develop a sense of confidence.confidence is a tricky thing for some people to find. show gratitude.the most charming people out there are always happy to show someone how they really feel through the power of gratitude. express yourself emotionally.the most charismatic people are open to express their feelings with sincerity. make yourself relatable. allow yourself to show vulnerability.although it may seem like the most charming individuals would also be the strongest or most perfect, that's the farthest thing from the truth. stay committed. set goals together.regardless whether you're in a romantic relationship or something completely platonic, setting out goals and accomplishing them as a team brings people closer together. return the affection. be patient.

"If you already speak English or any language with a Latinate script, you may think you already have the alphabet down. But language is constantly evolving and while most things are the same, there are a few differences.J, V, and W don't exist. Well, not really at least. There were 23 letters in the classic Latin alphabet.  R is rolled, similar to the trill in Spanish.  Y is known as 'i Graeca' ('Greek i') and Z is 'zeta.'  I can sometimes be pronounced as the english Y sound and Y is pronounced like the French 'u.'  If you know the IPA, that means the letter I is sometimes pronounced as /j/ and the letter Y is sometimes pronounced as /y/. See the reasoning?  U is sometimes similar to a W -- in fact, that's where the letter comes from. It's written as 'v.';  , While pronouncing Latin doesn't offer near as many trip ups as English does (generally, each letter sticks to a sound), there are a couple of things to keep in mind: length and combinations.  An apex (´) or acute accent (like the accent aigu in French) is used to denote long vowels. With one, 'a' becomes like the sound in 'father' instead of the sound in 'hat.' 'E' alone is 'bed,' but with the apex it's more like the sound in 'café.'  Unfortunately, modern Latin spelling has made this very confusing by using the macron (¯) to denote length of vowels, too, when it's normally used to denote long syllables. Now it seems noting syllable and vowel length is a free-for-all and most dictionaries don't do it sufficiently. And to make matters worse, Spanish uses the same symbol to denote accented syllables. But if you find yourself in Italy and you squint a little bit, you should notice the apexes on Roman inscriptions (at least from classical and postclassical times) in all their rightful glory.Different vowel/consonant combinations can change the sound of the letters. 'Ae' becomes the sound in 'kite' (or /ai/); 'ch' makes a 'k' sound; 'ei' makes the sound in 'day' (/ei/); 'eu' sounds like 'ee-ooo'; 'oe' is the same as the sound in 'toy.'  If you know the IPA, this all becomes a lot easier -- there are tons of similarities. Needless to say, the IPA is Latin-derived., English has a lot of Latin roots and therefore shares some of the same emphasis patterns. However, it'd be ridiculous to say anything applies 100% in the current Lingua Franca. For Latin, keep these rules in mind:  For one syllable words, well, emphasis isn't an issue.  For two syllable words, emphasize the first syllable (pos-co: I demand)  For polysyllabic words, emphasis goes on the penultimate syllable if it's heavy or long (mentiuntur: they lie).  For polysyllabic words that have a light or short syllable penultimately, the emphasis goes on the antipenultimate syllable (imperator: commander).  All these rules are similar to this day in English. In fact, English long considered Latin's rules as the 'right' way to speak and changed Germanic roots to fit in this box. It's the same reason your English teacher tells you to not split infinitives (did you catch that?). The reasoning is Latin (and now archaic).  If you don't already have a sense of this, Latin is a very complicated language. You're about to embark upon a long, uphill battle. Here's an example: verbs have to consider a few things, right? Maybe plurality, person, and tense? Nope. Way more. But you can handle it, right? The Latin verbs must take the following things into consideration:Three persons -- first, second, and third  Two aspects -- perfect (finished) and imperfect (unfinished)  Two numbers -- singular and plural  Three moods -- indicative, subjunctive, and imperative  Six tenses -- present, imperfect, future, perfect, pluperfect, and future perfect  Two voices -- active and passive.  Four non-finite forms -- infinitive, gerund, participle, and supine  Have we mentioned yet that there are 7 cases and 3 genders for nouns?  ","familiarize yourself with the alphabet. get the pronunciation down. know where the emphasis goes. know what you're in for. "
"By not slipping up and continuing to perform your job duties as perfectly as you can, you leave the tyrant as little room as possible to complain about your work.Be punctual, work accurately, don’t call in sick, double-check your work and strive for the company’s overall good.  Try to anticipate your supervisor’s needs and comply with all requests.  Also give your boss positive reinforcement when they demonstrate successful communication and management. Say something like, “I appreciate you being so accommodating when I had to push my big project back by a few days to take on some new work.”;  , Make an attempt to discuss your feelings with your boss, in a way that can be constructive rather than critical. Practice your key points ahead of time. During the discussion with your boss, remain calm, stay positive and encourage an improved relationship.Express yourself in a way that is non-threatening, not critical and cannot be construed as whining.  Try saying something like, “Sometimes I feel as though my work doesn’t satisfy you, or it’s consistently inadequate. Is there something I could fix overall, or steps I could take to address this?”  Also bring up points like: “Some of the ways you speak to me and treat me make me feel as though I’m not a valued member of the office. Is there a way we can focus more on the positive aspects of the work I’m doing?”  , It may turn out that tyrannical behavior and office mismanagement simply stem from a breakdown of communication. Listen to your boss to gain insight to their side of the story.When communicating with your boss, ask clarifying questions so that you can both be clear about exactly what they expect you to accomplish.  Reminding your boss of all your current responsibilities may help them to realize that some of their demands are overbearing.  Also consider whether your boss's behavior is a product of their cultural background. In some cultures, an overbearing or authoritative posture is considered desirable.  ","perform as a model employee. communicate with your boss. see things from your boss’s perspective. "

"Trigonometry is based on the mathematical concept of the unit circle. This is a circle drawn on the x-y coordinate plane, with its center at (0,0), with a radius of 1. By setting the radius equal to 1, the trigonometric functions can be measured directly.If you envision a unit circle, any point on that circle establishes a right triangle. From a selected point on the circle, draw a vertical line directly to the x-axis. Then from that point on the x-axis, draw a horizontal line connecting to the origin. These two lines, the vertical and the horizontal, serve as the legs of a right triangle. The radius of the circle that connects the point on the circle to the center at the origin is the hypotenuse of the right triangle.  Trigonometric functions still apply to triangles and lengths other than 1, but setting the radius equal to 1 makes calculating the ratios more direct.  The sine function is the ratio of the leg opposite a chosen angle to the hypotenuse of the right triangle. On the unit circle, the sine is a way of measuring the vertical distance from the x-axis to the designated point. This is another way of saying that it is the y-coordinate of the chosen point.The sine of an angle is commonly abbreviated as “sin.” The angle of measurement is often labeled θ{\displaystyle \theta }, by convention, so you say you are measuring sin⁡θ{\displaystyle \sin \theta } or sin(θ){\displaystyle sin(\theta )}.  For example, if you select an angle, called θ{\displaystyle \theta }, of 30 degrees at the center of the unit circle, this would mark a point on the circle with coordinates (32,12){\displaystyle ({\frac {\sqrt {3}}{2}},{\frac {1}{2}})}. You can then say that sin⁡θ=12{\displaystyle \sin \theta ={\frac {1}{2}}}., The cosine function is the ratio of the leg adjacent to the chosen angle divided by the hypotenuse of the right triangle. On the unit circle, the cosine is the length of the horizontal leg, which is also the x-axis coordinate of the point on the circle.The cosine of an angle is commonly abbreviated as “cos.” You say you are measuring cos⁡θ{\displaystyle \cos \theta } or cos⁡(θ){\displaystyle \cos(\theta )}.  For example, if you select an angle θ{\displaystyle \theta } of 30 degrees at the center of the unit circle, this would mark a point on the circle with coordinates (32,12){\displaystyle ({\frac {\sqrt {3}}{2}},{\frac {1}{2}})}. You can then say that cos⁡θ=32{\displaystyle \cos \theta ={\frac {\sqrt {3}}{2}}}., The third common trigonometric function is the tangent. The tangent is the ratio of the two legs of the right triangle to each other, without reference to they hypotenuse. Specifically, for a chosen angle of a right triangle, the tangent is found by dividing the length of the leg opposite to the chosen angle over the leg adjacent to the chosen angle. On the unit circle, the tangent is equal to the y-coordinate divided by the x-coordinate.The tangent function is often abbreviated as “tan.” For a selected angle θ{\displaystyle \theta }, you say you are measuring tan⁡θ{\displaystyle \tan \theta } or tan⁡(θ){\displaystyle \tan(\theta )}.  For the example of an angle θ{\displaystyle \theta } of 30 degrees at the center of the unit circle, recall that the coordinates are (32,12){\displaystyle ({\frac {\sqrt {3}}{2}},{\frac {1}{2}})}. You can find the tangent by dividing the sine (y-coordinate) by the cosine (x-coordinate) as follows:  tan⁡θ=1232=33=0.577{\displaystyle \tan \theta ={\frac {\frac {1}{2}}{\frac {\sqrt {3}}{2}}}={\frac {\sqrt {3}}{3}}=0.577}.Note that reporting the result in terms of a fraction with the square root, such as 33{\displaystyle {\frac {\sqrt {3}}{3}}} is generally considered more precise and more accurate than rounding to a decimal like 0.577. For practically purposes, a three-place decimal may be acceptable.  Occasionally, you may need alternate ratios than the cosine, sine and tangent. These alternative functions are inverses of the first three. They are less commonly used in basic calculations. However, in more advanced trigonometric work, they become essential. These functions are:Secant. This is abbreviated as “sec” and is equal to 1cos{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{cos}}}.  Cosecant. The cosecant is abbreviated as “csc” and is equal to 1sin{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{sin}}}.  Cotangent. The cotangent is abbreviated as “cot” and is equal to 1tan{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{tan}}}.  When trying to remember the ratios of the primary functions sin, cos and tan, many students use the memory tool “SOHCAHTOA.” When broken into its parts, it provides the ratios as follows:  SOH stands for the initials of sin, opposite, hypotenuse, and calls to mind the ratio:  sin=oppositehypotenuse{\displaystyle \sin ={\frac {\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}}}  CAH stands for the initials of cos, adjacent, hypotenuse, as follows:  cos=adjacenthypotenuse{\displaystyle \cos ={\frac {\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}}}  TOA stands for the initials of tan, opposite, adjacent, and represents the ratio:  tan=oppositeadjacent{\displaystyle \tan ={\frac {\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}}}  ","understand the unit circle. learn the sine relationship. review the cosine function. understand the tangent function. review the other ratios. learn the mnemonic device sohcahtoa.

"Some pumps don't give you what you pay for. If you want to get free gas, it's important to make sure that the gas you are paying for matches up with what is advertised. Sometimes the pumps can be miscalibrated, and if they are, you can get some extra gas for free.Try filling up a container you're sure of the dimensions of, like a gas can, instead of your tank. Use a calculator quickly to make sure that the price that you're paying matches the amount that went in. If it doesn't, go in and ask for a refund, or for extra gas.  If you find a pump in your town that's reliably wonky, keep going back to it and complaining every time it messes up. Print your receipts every time and double-check.;  , At some pumps, even newer multi-pump dispensers, you can take the nozzle out of the dispenser with one hand and grip the hose 2-3 feet above the nozzle with your other hand, and shake firmly downward, as if you were cracking a whip. A small amount of gas will squirt from the nozzle every time you do this, and it won't show up on the counter.  Warning: This can be extremely dangerous, resulting in damage to the dispenser or personal injury. It's also a good way to get you into trouble and a super-inefficient way to fill your tank.  Often, a little gas will keep coming after you cut off the flow. Shake the hose gently and get the rest of the gas out of it and into the tank. It won't be like getting a full tank for free, but you'll be getting a little extra than what you paid for.  ","print out your receipts and check the pumps. shake the hose. keep the dispenser in your tank for as long as possible. "
"Do not automatically perceive anything that is different to be 'wrong'. Withholding judgment will allow you to be an objective observer and will facilitate the process of cross-cultural understanding. Also, if you are going to a country with which you know close to nothing about, do a little background information. As you learn about the country in which you are going to, keeping an open mind is necessary, and, who knows, you may find the reason for something you may not understand.;  , This increases your communication skills and it helps you to integrate with the local community. It also demonstrates your interest in the new country.  Do not assume or interpret behavior from your own cultural perspective or 'filter'. Behavior is not data. For example, Americans often use the phrase 'How are you?' to mean 'hello' or 'I acknowledge your presence as I pass you in the hall.' A foreigner may wonder why Americans don't respond in detail to this question about one's well-being. Thus they may interpret the behavior of walking away before one has a chance to respond to the question to be 'uncaring', 'superficial' or even 'rude'. An American knows otherwise and would probably not be offended that someone did not take the time to respond to this question. Remember: If in doubt, check it out!  , Even as you become more savvy about rituals, customs and protocol in your new environment, be careful not to attribute an explanation or rationale to what you now believe you know. A little bit of knowledge can be misleading. Psychologist Geert Hofstede wrote that 'culture' is like an onion that can be peeled, layer by layer, to reveal the content. It takes a long time to really understand a culture in its social and historical context.  Respectfully ask questions, read newspapers, and attend a variety of festivals and events.  Establishing a routine will give you a feeling of safety.  Don't be too hard on yourself if you make a cultural gaffe or don't know what to do in a social situation. Laugh at yourself and others will laugh with you. Most individuals will admire your tenacity and effort to understand their ways, especially if you are devoid of judgment and cultural comparisons that subtly and perhaps unconsciously convey a veil of superiority.  ","keep an open mind. make an effort to learn the local language. get acquainted with the social conduct of your new environment. do not take cultural familiarity or knowledge at face-value. make sure you get to know people in your new environment. try to achieve a sense of stability in your life. most importantly, maintain a sense of humor!

"Be sure to address exactly what it is that your teacher wants out of this report. That is the key step to getting good marks.;  , There is a lot of information out there on dinosaurs. The key to preparing a good report is to choose a distinctive topic within the subject of dinosaurs and to investigate deeply within the narrow confines of that topic. For example, ideas that might be suitable for exacting research include:  Methods of finding dinosaur fossils or methods for preserving them  A study of the eating habits of herbivore dinosaurs or carnivore dinosaurs  Examination of the changes in thinking of paleontologists about the coloring and textures of dinosaurs  A study of how dinosaurs are displayed in museums  Research into the perils of being a young dinosaur  , Good research takes account of competing ideas. This means that you can discuss both arguments while still preferring one side over the other, but you must provide reasons for why you think your ideas are preferable. For example, you might write something like:  Dinosaur display methods are generally able to convey to the public what dinosaurs looked like. However, Hobson says that some museums are not doing a very good job at displaying the larger dinosaur exhibits because they don't have high enough roofs. I disagree with this because I have visited 8 museums and only one of the eight had a roof problem and even then I would propose the following solution to fix that.  Explain what you looked at, the issues you are raising and your conclusion. Write clearly in the report and avoid making sweeping statements. Try to keep your theme flowing throughout the report and make a sensible conclusion based on the things written in your report.  A good report will show that you have done the research and not just made up everything off the top of your head. Acknowledge quotes and ideas properly and create a bibliography detailing the books, online resources, museum visits, interviews, etc., that you have used to inform your report.  With modern printing methods and computing, there is little excuse for not producing wonderful illustrations of dinosaurs to spruce up your report. You can still draw your own illustrations, of course, just be sure to scan them in and include them in your printed report.  Use hard card, images and fancy fonts to make the front cover. Join the report together with staples, binding, or twine. You might even like to consider making the cover in the shape of a dinosaur.  ","read the question or request from your teacher. research. balance your research. have a strong introduction that sets the scene about the research in your report. leave references for your teacher to follow. use pictures. consider presenting your report as something different by giving it a cover design.

"If you are only mildly potassium deficient, eating potassium-rich foods should balance out your potassium levels. Once you have purchased potassium supplements, only take the prescribed amount--over compensating and taking more than the prescribed amount could lead to diarrhea, stomach irritation, and nausea and may cause muscle weakness, slowed heart rate, and abnormal heart rhythm.  Extended-release form tablets are designed so that it will not dissolve in the stomach, but in the intestines. This extended release will help prevent the irritation of gastric lining. Potassium tablets should be taken with one full glass of water.Do not crush or chew potassium tablet as this will affect their extended-release feature.  You can purchase potassium powder or liquid that can be mixed with water and then drunk. For the correct dosage, you should follow the instructions provided by your doctor. Generally, powdered and liquid potassium must be completely dissolved in a ½ glass of water. If too much of this powder or liquid is consumed, it could cause gastric irritation., Taking potassium intravenously is strictly intended for extreme cases of potassium depletion and used under strict physician supervision. If you think your potassium levels are dangerously low, talk to your doctor about intravenous potassium. Do not try this on your own.

"Since you need to use your hands to stop the bleeding, it’s best if you can clean your hands first. Obviously this will be more difficult if you’re attempting treatment where you were injured.Alternatively, use protective medical gloves if you happened to have some, or they’re accessible nearby.  Avoid using your bare hands directly on your tongue to stop the bleeding, if possible.  You do not want to swallow any blood if possible, as this will just cause you to get nauseous and vomit. Instead, sit up with your head tilted forwards and downwards so the blood will drain out of your mouth.If you had anything in your mouth at the time of the injury, remove it now (e.g. gum).  If you have a piercing in or around your mouth, and you can safely remove it, do so.  Use a clean cloth, or the cleanest cloth you have available, to apply pressure to your tongue. Only use your bare hands to apply pressure if you have nothing else to use, especially if you weren’t able to wash your hands first.Because it’s winter and you’re likely outside, a scarf or hat might be useful. But try to avoid using gloves or mitts as they’re most likely filthy.  Any cut or laceration of your tongue is going to bleed a lot because your tongue (and the rest of your mouth) contain a lot of blood vessels. This, however, can also be beneficial as the increased number of blood vessels also speeds up healing of the area., Do not let go of whatever material you’ve put on your wound for a minimum of 15 minutes. Use your watch or a clock to make sure you’ve keep constant pressure for a full 15 minutes. Do not be tempted to lift the material up to check if the wound is still bleeding.If blood soaks completely through the material you’re using, apply another piece of material on top of the existing one without removing it (or decreasing pressure).  Most mild bleeding will slow down significantly after 15 minutes, but the wound may still continue to bleed lightly for another 45 minutes.  If the wound is still bleeding profusely after 15 minutes, call 911 or go to the emergency room.  Avoid exercising for several days after your accident. Exercising, or exerting yourself, raises your blood pressure and can cause the wound to start bleeding again.  Granted, under the circumstances, the last thing you may want to do is put ice in your mouth, but it does help. Instead of ice, you can also use a cold compress (e.g. a clean face cloth run under cold water).For ice, you can use it two different ways. One way is to simply suck on an ice cube or ice chips. Another way is to wrap the ice in a thin (clean) cloth and apply the cloth to the wound on your tongue.  Use the ice or cold compress method for one to three minutes at a time, six to ten times per day, for at least the first day.  Ice, or cold, will not only reduce swelling and stop any additional bleeding, it will help reduce the amount of pain you feel.You can also use a popsicle or something similar in lieu of ice if you prefer.  Mix up a solution of salt water using 1 teaspoon of salt for every cup of water. Use the salt water solution to rinse out your mouth by swishing the water around inside your mouth, then spitting it out. Don’t swallow the salt water.Don’t start the salt water rinse until the day after your injury.  Use the salt water solution at least after each time you eat, but up to four to six times a day.  While your tongue (or lips) are healing, you may be more susceptible to frostbite or chilblains (skin sores or bumps) in those areas. Protect yourself from the cold with a scarf, gloves, or balaclava to cover your face while you heal.  Your tongue and mouth will not only be sore, but most likely quite sensitive. Try to eat only soft foods that are gentle on your mouth at first. Avoid any foods that are salty, spicy or have a high level of acid, as these may be painful to eat.Foods to consider eating are: milk shakes, yogurt, ice cream, cottage cheese, eggs, tuna, smooth peanut butter, and well-cooked or canned vegetables and fruits.  Do NOT smoke or drink alcohol while your tongue is healing.  You may wish to avoid mouthwash that contains alcohol while you’re tongue is healing, as that may sting quite a bit.  If you have gone to see a doctor, they will advise what medications you should or can take. Follow their instructions explicitly. If the injury wasn’t serious enough to see a doctor, you can consider taking over-the-counter pain medications to help reduce any discomfort.Over-the-counter pain medications that may work would include acetaminophen (i.e. Tylenol), ibuprofen (i.e. Advil) or naproxen (i.e. Aleve). The generic and brand name versions of all these medications are readily available in any pharmacy and most grocery stores.  Always follow the instructions on the package for over-the-counter medication, and speak to your pharmacist if you have any questions.  If you are pregnant, or might be pregnant, do not take ibuprofen or naproxen.  If one or more of the following things occur, consider going to your doctor as soon as possible to have your wound checked:  If the pain from your wound increases over time, instead of getting better  If your tongue, or other parts of your mouth, start to swell  If you develop a fever  If you have trouble breathing  If the wound won’t stop bleeding, or opens up and starts bleeding profusely again  ","wash your hands. sit up with your head tilted forward. stop the bleeding. keep steady pressure on your tongue for 15 minutes. reduce pain and swelling with ice. rinse regularly with salt water. protect yourself from the cold. be careful of what you eat. take medications if needed. know when to see a doctor.

"Diversification is not only the key to building wealth, it's also the key to sustaining the wealth that you have. Ensure that your money is well diversified across a broad spectrum of investment classes including stocks, bonds, mutual funds, real estate, and cash.Different areas of the market will respond differently to the same event,so if you have invested in both stocks and bonds, for instance, your stocks may take a hit in a market swing, but you may compensate for the loss by a positive movement in the bond market.Keep in mind that your risk objective may be different than when you were building wealth. You may now find capital preservation (keeping what you have) becoming more important than the risk that comes along with more aggressive (risky) investments.  Understand the risk-return tradeoff.This principle states that the higher the risk you take with an investment, the higher the potential return.Determine your risk tolerance (how much you can safely afford to lose if the investment fails, how much time you have to recover from a potential loss) and talk to your financial adviser about how to balance your investments so that you get some return, but you don't risk financial ruin in the process.  Keep liquidity in mind. Liquidity refers to how quickly and easily an asset or security can be turned into another asset.Cash is extremely liquid, while something like real estate is not.Although you can build a great deal of wealth 'on paper' using real estate, you'll also find that it takes time to sell your real estate properties and convert them to cash. If you think you'll ever need cash from your assets in a hurry, it's best not to park too much of that cash into real estate.  Learn more about diversification by reading How to Reduce Financial Risk.;  , You shouldn't stop trying to build wealth just because you're rich. Some of the richest people in the world are still making investments (check out any episode of Shark Tank for evidence of that). Now that you're rich, it's time to make money work for you instead of you working for money. Find business opportunities that you can invest in to build on the wealth that you have.  Become an angel investor.When you're an angel investor, you'll have the opportunity to invest in startups. You could become a part of the next Uber or Amazon.  This is also a way to 'invest with your values' by investing in particular companies you believe in and supporting them in a more direct way.  Live on your income, not your liquidation of assets, or keep your spending within what is considered a safe zone. Many experts suggest keeping your spending under 4–6% of your liquid net worth each year.  Avoid liquidating your assets just to buy luxury items, otherwise you'll be a consumer who loses money and not an investor who earns money. Spending money on things that do not retain value or have no sentimental value is not a good way to make your money last.  Yes, even if you're rich, you're going to need to live on a budget. This is for two reasons.  For starters, a budget is just as important for you if you're rich as it is for someone of lesser means, because it's easy to fall victim to the 'bottomless pit' mindset. That's when you perceive that you have an infinite supply of money. As a result, you're more likely to burn through it and lose it. If you maintain a budget, you'll be in a better position to preserve your wealth.  A budget is a good idea for everybody. A budget forces you to itemize your spending and practice discipline with your hard-earned wealth.  If you are showing off your wealth by purchasing a variety of luxury goods, it might be a good idea to think about whether you are doing this for genuine reasons or if you are doing so to prove something to others. You are more likely to preserve your wealth and feel fulfilled by not spending in this way.  If you'd like to preserve your wealth for future generations, consider establishing a financial trust that will prevent spendthrift descendants from squandering away the money that you'd like to pass on to them.  Anthony Fittizzi, managing director and wealth strategist at U.S. Trust, tells his clients that a trust places safeguards around how beneficiaries can access and spend the money that's been left to them.You can also dictate how your money is spent in the future when you set up a trust. That's a great way to ensure that your wealth preservation strategies continue throughout future generations. You may set up a stipulation that the money in the trust can only be used for educational purposes, for instance, or that it will be dispensed in set a yearly or monthly sum.Be aware that once you place your assets in a trust, they are no longer considered to be your assets., This is especially important if it has been recently or rapidly acquired, as such as shift typically means new challenges and concerns, rather than the elimination of stress around finances. Speak with the above experts and you'll be on the right track.  Financial advisers help you create a financial plan as well as manage your investments.

Proper estate planning can result in your wishes being carried out beyond your lifetime as well as save taxes on your estate.  Many people who have wealth suddenly become terrified that they're going to lose it all due to an economic setback or some other unfortunate occurrence. Remember when you evaluate alternative investment options to not get caught up in the hype but to always look at the opportunity from a financial standpoint.  Avoid following the 'herd.' Just because everybody else is investing in gold or the stock of XYZ Corporation doesn't mean that those are good investments.  When you're evaluating a business deal, look beyond the personality of the person who's proposing the deal and strictly evaluate the merits of the deal on the financials. It's easy to fall in love with a personality, but it won't necessarily make you any money.  Focus on what's important in life. If you're able to spend additional time with your family or give back to the community — doing so may help bring perspective and peace of mind.

"Your first impulse might be to say, 'I need them all.' However, you'd be surprised how much energy you can save by reducing your use of appliances, and how much satisfaction comes from being self-reliant.Consider changing your habits regarding the following energy-sapping appliances:  The dryer. If you have access to outside space, hang a clothesline and start drying your clothes outside. You can also get a drying rack to use indoors - just place it in your bedroom or bathroom near a window. If you must continue using the dryer, reduce your usage to once a week or so, rather than throwing in small loads every other day.  The dishwasher. Make sure each load you do is completely full. If you have time to wash dishes by hand using the water conservation method, that's even better.  The oven. Heating an electric oven requires a lot of energy. Plan to do all of your baking on one day of the week, while the oven is hot, instead of heating it every few days for various purposes.  The vacuum. Sweep whenever you can instead of using a vacuum. Even a carpet can be swept between vacuuming sessions to remove larger pieces of debris.  Make a habit of unplugging everything that's not in use, especially computers, TVs and sound systems, which use up the most energy.  Don't forget small appliances like coffee makers, hair dryers and phone chargers.  Determine whether it's really necessary to keep plug-in air fresheners and night lights.  Older appliances weren't always designed with energy conservation in mind. If you have an older refrigerator, dishwasher, oven, or dryer, you may be using more energy (and paying more money) than strictly necessary for the chores you need to do. Conduct research to find newer models that are more energy efficient.  ","decide which appliances you really need to use. unplug everything.electronics and appliances continue sapping energy while they're plugged in, even when they're switched to 'off.', replace old appliances with newer models.

"Fats come to us from many sources - animal and plant - and thus can have very different properties. Luckily, when cooking, only a few are important:  Flavor. Though the fats themselves are generally odorless, they carry with them a variety of chemicals (or lack of them) that can vary between the strong flavor of unrefined palm oil to the bland flavor of canola oil, or from the subtly sweet flavor of coconut oil to the grassy richness of a good quality tallow. Unfortunately, flavor is a terribly subjective (and complicated) beast, and so it is impossible to properly discuss it here.  Viscosity. A measure of how 'thick', or liquid, the fat is when melted, it is important to the ability of fats to prevent foods from sticking to pans, and changes how the food feels in the mouth. It is primarily affected by how big each molecule of fat is, expressed as the chain length: long chain lengths mean high viscosity oils which flow slowly and coat surfaces thickly.  Melting Point. The temperature that the fat melts at. This is important if the dish is to be served (or prepared) cold, or if the melting point is higher than the temperature of the mouth: if the fat solidifies, the food feels greasy, and many sauces and dressings break. Melting point is influenced by the percentage of saturated fat and how big the average chain length is: saturated fats and long chain lengths give us fats with high melting points.  Smoke Point. Different oils will begin to smoke at different temperatures.  Chemical Reactivity. Fats can be oxidized by the air, especially at high temperatures, which damages flavor and is bad for health. For these reasons, this article suggests not cooking with (poly)unsaturated oils, which are more reactive than other fats, at high temperatures or for long periods of time.;  , In different foods and cooking methods, the role of any included fat varies, and thus your selection criteria will be different:  Pan-Frying, Stir-Fry, Sauteing. Other than flavor, the most important considerations are viscosity and reactivity; ideally, you will choose a viscous fat (to prevent the food from sticking and burning) which is highly saturated (so that it doesn't oxidize). It is also important to pick a fat which will not smoke at the high temperatures involved.  Deep Frying is rather forgiving, but prefers a nonreactive oil (so that it doesn't oxidize). Depending on preference, you may want to use a viscous oil (which will coat the fried food thickly), or a thin oil, to minimize the fat content of the cooked food.  Hot Soups and mixed into Baked goods, only the flavor matters.  Applied to the outside of baked goods, flavor still usually dominates, but reactivity is a potential consideration, due to the high surface temperatures.  Salad Dressings, Mayonnaise. It is vital that the food stay warmer than the melting point of the fat, or the emulsion will break, leaving you with two nasty layers rather than a creamy sauce.  An incomplete list is provided above, but feel free to apply these basic criteria:  If your food sticks, use a more viscous fat.  If your oil smokes, use a fat with a higher smoke point.  If you are cooking at a high temperature and/or for a long time, use a nonreactive (saturated) fat.  Often, you'll need to make a compromise, in which case there are a few options:  Mix different fats together to average their properties. For instance, mix some tallow into your coconut oil to increase the viscosity while still keeping the fat mixture liquid in the mouth.  Add your flavorful, but delicate or reactive, fats after most of the cooking is done.  ","learn the characteristics of fats. know the cooking method you are going to use and select the fat accordingly. determine the important characteristics for your cooking method. find a fat with the properties you need.

"Cleanse your skin thoroughly, wiping off any excess moisturizer. Dab your brows with translucent powder. The powder will give your makeup something to grip on to, allowing it to keep its definition and stay on longer.  Use a small, angled brush dipped in brow powder or eyeshadow to very lightly sketch the shape of an eyebrow. You can use the pencil trick from method one to determine precisely where your brow should begin, arch, and end, or you can eyeball it.  Drawing very lightly will allow you to easily erase the shape of the brow if you've made a mistake.  You don't need it to be perfect--too precise an eyebrow won't look as natural., This is essential for drawing natural-looking hair. Keep a sharp point throughout the process, and make sure you sharpen when switching to your other brow.  Don't try this with an eyeliner pencil instead of a brow pencil--it will smear and rub off.  Use light, upward strokes to draw little fake hairs on top of the shaded brow you already drew. This layering will help create a 3-D effect and make your brows look more realistic.  Use a cotton swab to soften the edges a little, giving your brows a more natural look., Dab a little more powder over your drawn-on eyebrows and finish with a makeup or brow sealing solution. The powder and sealer will ensure your brows don't smudge or get rubbed or sweated off during the day.  If the sealer is too shiny, use a brush to lightly dust translucent powder over the area, dulling the shine., As an alternative to using a pencil everyday, you can get your brows temporary tattooed on in a process called microblading. Hairlike strokes will be tattooed on to look like additional eyebrow hair. Consult a professional to ask about trying this process.  ","prepare your skin and brows. sketch the shape of your eyebrow. sharpen your pencil to an extra fine point. draw in hair. add makeup or brow sealing solution. try microblading. "

"Fill three medium size mixing bowls or shallow dishes each with a moderate amount of flour, eggs, and breadcrumbs. Bowls should only have one ingredient apiece. Whisk or beat the eggs with a fork until they are well blended.  Make the breading process easier by lining up the bowls so the first one contains flour, the second beaten eggs, and the third bread crumbs.  If you end up running out of an ingredient while making fried purslane, you can always add more. Leftover ingredients should be used immediately in another dish or thrown away., With your clean hands or tongs, pick up a clean stalk of purslane. Coat the stalk thoroughly in flour. Once coated, submerge the stalk completely in the eggs. Allow excess egg to drip into the egg bowl, then roll the purslane in breadcrumbs so it is completely covered.  Repeat this process until you have no purslane left. Breaded purslane can be fried one at a time or set off to the side and fried all at once., Place a sauté pan over medium heat and coat its bottom with a layer of olive oil. Transfer the purslane to the pan when it is heated. Cook the purslane for roughly five minutes or until the breading is golden brown. Flip the purslane while cooking so both sides fry evenly., Remove the purslane from the pan and lay it on paper towel to absorb excess oil. When it has cooled, it’s ready to eat. Lightly salt and pepper the purslane to taste.

"Train your cat immediately, whether you've brought home a new cat or just noticed your cat jumping on the furniture. Don't assume that the cat will simply stop jumping or will grow bored with it. Instead, show your displeasure and let your cat know that she's not allowed to jump on the furniture.  Avoid punishing your cat since she will not understand why you're yelling, hitting, or spraying with water.;  , When you see your cat jump on the furniture, look at her and say 'no' in a firm voice. Do not yell at her, but let her know you're unhappy. Pick her up and remove her from the furniture while saying 'no.' Set her down in a spot she's allowed to be (like her cat bed, a cat tower, or some other comfy place that she enjoys).  Don't punish your cat once you've removed her from the furniture. Let her go find somewhere else to explore.  If your cat returns to the furniture and jumps on it, say 'no' again and remove her. You need to do this every time you see your cat jump up on the furniture. Over time, she'll associate jumping on the furniture with being removed from it.  Your cat will be confused if you only remove her some of the times she jumps on the furniture. Send a consistent message that jumping on the furniture is not allowed.  Startle your cat by placing something like aluminum foil on the furniture. Your cat will be surprised by the noise when she jumps up on the furniture. You can also fill a can with rocks and shake it when you notice her jumping, although she shouldn't see you shaking it. Instead, she should associate jumping on the furniture with a surprising noise.  Consider using something that will make noise when you're not home (like the aluminum foil).  Cats don't like the feeling of being stuck, so place double-sided tape along all parts of the furniture. Your cat will probably jump up, feel uncomfortable, and then jump off. You may want to leave the adhesive on for a day or two, so that she understands not to jump on the furniture.  Some pet stores carry a double-sided adhesive that doesn't leave a residue when it's removed., Surprise your cat by spraying her with water or an unpleasant-tasting spray. You can buy bitter apple spray from pet stores. When you see your cat jump on the furniture, immediately spray her. This will startle her and she should begin to associate the furniture with an unpleasant surprise.  Spraying your cat with water might prevent her from jumping on the furniture, but some argue that it destroys your bond with your cat and can increase her stress level., This may be a hassle for you, but you may want to fill the furniture so that you cat can no longer jump on the furniture and rest comfortably. You might place books, large boxes, or just make it difficult for the cat to even get close to the furniture.  It may take a few days for your cat to move on.

There may be a good view from the couch. Or, she may like cuddling on a big armchair. Your cat may be determined to keep jumping on the furniture and she might be doing it out of boredom.Remember that your cat isn't jumping on the furniture to bother you. Don't take the behavior personally, just work to prevent it.  Your cat might be jumping on the furniture to get a good view. Help her look outside by hanging a cat shelf. This shelf can be hung low enough for your cat to jump up on and get to a window. Or, place several cat shelves so she can jump around.You can also place a cat tower near a window. This way, she can climb up and still get a good view.  Teach your cat to respond to commands by using a clicking device. Make your cat associate the clicking sound of the device with reward. For example, click the device and give your cat a cuddle or treat. Do this a few times until she understands that she gets a reward after the click.Once your cat understands the clicker, use it to encourage her when she jumps onto places she's allowed, like her bed, cat tower, or designated space., Your cat may be jumping up on the furniture because she's bored. Offer her new toys to help her use up energy. Get several toys that you can scatter along the floor. This might also redirect her interest back to the floor and away from the furniture.

"As mentioned above, your hook can pretty much be whatever you want it to — especially in a personal essay — as long as it sets the scene and touches on what the essay is going to be about. You might find some of the following hooks to be profitable starting points or examples to you in your introduction:  'I was walking down our driveway when disaster struck.'  'Though she wouldn't know it at the time, my mother was poised to make a far-reaching political statement on the morning of June 4th, 1976, without even saying a word.'  'I've made a few mistakes in my young life, but none of them ended up teaching me as much as when I first disobeyed the law.'  , Personal essays are powerful because we share information in them that often isn't shared.

"Have this conversation with your child at a time when you won't be rushed. Also, hold the discussion in a place where he or she feels comfortable.  Never ask your child about sexual abuse in front of the abuser.  Note that asking your child if someone is 'hurting' him or her may not lead to the information you are looking for. Because sexual abuse can feel good to the victim, a child may not understand how to answer this question.  Reassure him or her that he or she will not get in trouble for anything told to you.  Remain calm, even if your child comes forward with allegations of sexual abuse. A child may misinterpret your anger toward the abuser as anger toward him or her.  Many abusers rely on a child's willingness to remain silent by telling their victim that what has happened between them is a secret.  If necessary, consult with a trusted professional (i.e. a pediatrician, therapist, or law enforcement officer) who is experienced in handling sexual abuse allegations.  Remind your child that you are always available to talk about his or her safety and that you will do whatever it takes to ensure his or her safety.  If your child tells you that he or she has been abused, immediately contact local authorities. Do not directly contact the abuser or the institution where the abuse occurred (i.e. school or church).  ","choose a time and location carefully. ask your child if anyone has been touching him or her in an unsafe manner or in a way that makes him or her feel uncomfortable. use a nonjudgmental tone when discussing sexual abuse with your child. explain to your child that it is okay to disclose a secret, even if an adult has made him or her promise not to do so. believe your child - children rarely make false allegations of sexual abuse. follow-up with your child, especially if your suspicions persist but he or she does not reveal sexual abuse. take sexual abuse allegations seriously. "
"First things first, grief is good. Emotion is good. Crying is good. Anger is good. Whatever it is, it's probably normal and needs to be let out. Once the hiding-under-the-covers phase is over, the process can start. But there's a definite linear process to letting go, and the hiding-under-the-covers phase (also known as the crying-over-a-tub-of-ice-cream phase or the less work-friendly dying-your-hair-a-strange-color phase) has to come first. Let it.  The first thing you'll probably feel is denial, followed by anger. It won't sink in as real and then when it does, the words that were exchanged and the exchanges that were had will evoke frustration and pain. Instead of tormenting yourself not only for the break up but for how you're handling the break up, know that this is how it works. These emotions you're feeling are a part of you. You're not crazy and you're not worthless. You're just human.;  , You may find yourself reliving all the great moments you had together. In bed, you'll be scanning them like a broken record. But if you had the person back, 10 minutes later you'd be thinking, 'That's right. That's why it wasn't working.' It's just hard to remember all the crap when you're caught up in such intense emotion. Know that if you do find yourself pining over great memories, you're not seeing it realistically.  If you need some science to back it up, know that emotion is proved to affect memory. So when you're searching desperately for the good, your mind may even formulate new twists to meet your current expectations.Basically, your memory is putting on rose-colored glasses to meet your current thought process.  'Letting go' is basically a euphemism for forgetting. For not giving a care, anymore. This sounds a little harsh, so that's why it's given the friendlier term. That being said, distancing yourself from the person is the only way you can get on the fast-track to forgetting. You know that shirt you found in the back of your closet that made you say, 'Oh my god, I loved this shirt! How in the world did I not realize it was missing?' Yep. Out of sight, out of mind.  This is much, much, much easier said than done for a lot of people, sure. But you can take efforts to limit how much time you have to spend in this person's general vicinity. Use it as an excuse to dive into a new passion, find a new hotspot to hang out in, or a new group of people to occasionally go out with. Do not revamp your life to accommodate this person, but do keep your best interests in mind.  After you're angry and sad and making bets with the devil that you'll never be this dumb again, you'll probably spend a few days/weeks/what will seem like an eternity wondering where it all went wrong, feeling like you're wandering through a fog. It'll be tempting to stop functioning, but you can't. You mustn't. For you. For the betterment of your world, you have to keep going.  This is where you do whatever you need to do. 'You' comes first right now. Whatever will make you happy, do it (as long as it's not harmful, of course). So go paint the town red. If you can't talk your friend through the fact that someone stole her ham sandwich at work, so be it. You get some time to be selfish. Your mantra should be 'me, me, me.' Why? Because you rock.  You're going to come out of this shortly (at which point the 'me, me, me' phase should be replaced by 'me, you, me, you'), and the last thing you want is to hold a global grudge. Being jaded and cynical does not equate to 'learning from an experience' -- it's more akin to giving up. Try hard to see the best in people. It's out there. It's just hiding sometimes.  Not all men are scum and not all women are conniving. Maybe you have a penchant for the conniving scum, but that's an issue in and of itself. Take a thorough look at the types of people out there -- how much diversity can you find? Bet there's a ton. That's why they call it diversity.  The beauty of your mind is that it's a part of you and that it can be controlled. If the negative thoughts start, you have the power to stop them. The train of thought you get on is one you can hop right off. Sometimes it takes a few tricks, but it's doable.  Put your negative thoughts into a cartoon character voice. Donald Duck is a good one. Try saying, 'I hate myself for being such an idiot' in his voice. A little hard to take seriously, huh?  Consciously hold your head up. Keeping it up cues your body that you're present and prideful. Keeping it down resonates in your shame centers and can actually make you feel worse. This little movement can determine so much.  Your absolute best resource right now will be your support network. They'll keep your mind off things and just keep you going. Don't be afraid to ask them for their help -- they've probably all been there too!  Ask them to help you not dwell. You need to talk about your feelings, definitely, but a time limit on. Ask them if you can have 15 minutes of their time to talk but after that, you're not interested in pointless analysis and regret. They'll keep you from drowning in your woes.  Fact of the matter is you're probably awesome and this is just a minor setback. Chances are you've felt this way before and overcame it, so why won't you this time? If you've bounced back once, you can bounce back twice. You're resilient, you've just forgotten that you're resilient. Keep on living, and the letting go will come.  It's when you stop living that you can't let go. When you live (seeking opportunities, enjoying life, surrounding yourself with the things and people you love), the letting go happens on its own and you'll barely even notice. Think back to who you were prior to this. What did you love? What made you you? How fantastic were you?  ","let yourself feel. don't glorify the past. distance yourself as much as possible. don't put you second. don't blame all of (wo)mankind. keep the negative thoughts at bay. lean on your friends. find who you were and love it.

"You'll need to bring the check, a valid ID, and your account number with you to make the deposit.;  , These should be readily available at your bank, usually in a stack on a table with pens and other slips. You can also request one from the teller, but the process will move more quickly if you do this ahead of time.  You'll need to fill in your account number, the amount of the check, how much (if any) you want in cash, savings, and checking, and the total amount of the check.  First, go through the elements written on the front and back of the check to ensure the check’s validity. Check that the following items are written and completed in a legible manner, and are true and correct: name and address of the person or entity issuing the check, date of issue, your name, amount of money being given written in both numeric and alphabetic form.

"Depression manifests physically, mentally, and emotionally. Mental health professionals use a system to diagnose depression that includes experiencing a majority of of the following symptoms across environments (home, school, work, social) for 2 or more weeks:Depressed mood for most of the day (feeling sad, down)  Feeling hopeless or helpless (nothing you can do will make things better)  Loss of pleasure or interest in most activities (things that used to be enjoyable no longer are)  Problems concentrating (at home, work, or school; easy tasks are now difficult)  Feelings of guilt (feeling like you messed up and can never recover)  Feelings of worthlessness (nothing you do seems to matter)  Thoughts of death or taking your life;  , Although suicidal thoughts are not necessary for a diagnosis of depression, they can be a symptom of the disorder.If you experience thoughts of suicide or wanting to take your life, do not wait. Reach out to a friend or family member for help or seek professional help.  If you are in danger of taking your life, Call Emergency Services.  You may go directly to the Emergency Department at your local hospital. Mental health professionals will work with you to create a plan to talk yourself down and also help you find ways to cope with thoughts of suicide.  If you have a therapist, let your therapist know you are having thoughts of suicide.  Call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, which is available 24 hours each day, 7 days a week at 1-800-273-TALK (8255). Operators are trained to talk about ways to back down from committing suicide.  Depression results in a number of changes to your body and behavior. When diagnosing depression, mental health professionals look at physical symptoms to help guide diagnosis. Much like emotional/mental symptoms, a diagnosis of depression most often includes experiencing the majority of the following symptoms for 2 or more weeks:Changes in sleeping (excessive sleeping or not sleeping enough)  Changes in eating (overeating or loss of appetite)  Slowing of motions (feeling like movement takes all of your energy)  Loss of energy, fatigue (no energy for daily tasks, not being able to get out of bed)  , Recent stressful events can trigger the onset of depression. Even positive events can trigger depression, such as moving, starting a new job, getting married, or having a baby. Your body and your mind take time to adjust to new experiences, and sometimes recent changes can trigger a depressive episode. If you’ve endured a traumatic event (such as loss of a child or living through a natural disaster), depression can result. Prolonged negative experiences can also lead to depression, such as enduring childhood or adult physical, emotional, or sexual abuse.Substance use can trigger depression, particularly alcoholism.  Health problems can also trigger depression, such as receiving a major diagnosis or coping with health difficulties.  Just because you’ve experienced a stressful event does not mean you will develop depression. It can trigger a depressive episode, but nothing can force you to experience depression.  If you’ve struggled with symptoms of depression, you may be at higher risk for experiencing depression again. About 50% of people who experience a depressive episode will experience depression again in their lifetime.Examine your previous experiences and note any prolonged periods of time that you experienced symptoms of depression.  Notice any links to depression in your immediate family (brothers, sisters, parents). Then examine your extended family (aunts, uncles, cousins, grandparents) and notice any symptoms of depression. Note if anyone in your family has committed suicide or struggled with mental health problems. Depression tends to run in families and has a strong genetic component. If you notice a strong occurrence within your family of depression, it can put you at higher risk.It’s important to realize that every family has links to mental health problems. Just because you have an aunt or parent who struggles with mental health does not mean you will develop a depression or another mental health issue.  You may feel happy and carefree during the summer, but then feel a cloud of sadness during the cold and dark winter. Aptly named SAD can begin to occur when days become shorter and when sunlight is less readily available. Symptoms of SAD can vary, but generally are similar to symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder and differ based on geographical location.Locations that receive very little sunlight for a period of time (such as Alaska, USA) have a higher rate of the population with SAD.  If you experience SAD, take advantage of any sunlight when available. Get up early in the morning and go for a walk, or take a quick lunch break to spend more time outside midday.  SAD may be effectively treated with light therapy, but nearly half of those with SAD do not get better with light therapy alone. For more information on light therapy, check out How to Choose a Light Therapy Box.  Teens experience depression in different ways than adults. Teens may appear more irritable, grumpy, or hostile when experiencing depression. Complaints of unexplained aches and pains may also indicate depression in teens.Sudden bursts of anger and increased sensitivity to criticism can also indicate depression.  Dropping grades, withdrawal from friends, and alcohol or drug use can also indicate problems with depression in teens., Giving birth is a magical time that leads to creating a family and having a child. For some women, however, the stage after giving birth is anything but jolly and gleeful. The hormonal changes, physical changes, and new role of caring for a newborn can become overwhelming. About 10 to 15% of women experience postpartum depression after birth.For some women, postpartum depression sets in soon after birth, while for others, onset occurs within the first few months, and gradually becoming more pronounced.In addition to symptoms of depression described above, additional signs of postpartum depression include:Lack of interest in your baby  Negative feelings toward your baby  Worrying about hurting your baby  Lack of concern for yourself  , This type of depression is typically less severe than Major Depressive Disorder, yet persists for a longer duration of time. People with persistent depressive disorder typically exhibit depressed mood lasting 2 or more years. Episodes of major depression may occur within the time frame, but depressed mood persists throughout the entire duration of two years., This type of depression occurs when a person experiences severe depression in addition to psychosis. Psychosis can include having false beliefs (such as believing you are the president or a spy), delusions (a distance with accepted reality, such as believing that you are being watched), or having hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that others do not experience).Psychotic depression can be dangerous and can result in death because of the distancing from reality. Seek help immediately by contacting a friend, or calling emergency services.  Bipolar disorder is characterized by cycling mood changes. A person may experience extreme lows (severe depression) and then experience extreme highs (mania). Bipolar disorder drastically shifts an individual’s mood, behavior, and thinking. When experiencing mania, an individual may behave in uncharacteristic ways, such as suddenly quitting a job, making several large purchases, or working on projects for days with barely any sleep. Depressive episodes tend to be severe, such as having an inability to get out of bed, hold a job, or perform basic daily functions.If you experience symptoms of bipolar disorder, seek professional help. It is highly unlikely that symptoms will cease without intervention. Some symptoms of mania can include:Feeling unusually optimistic  Feeling extremely irritable  Feeling highly energetic despite very little sleep  Racing thoughts  Rapidly paced talking  Impaired judgment, impulsivity  Delusions or hallucinations  For more information on bipolar disorder, check out How to Know if You Have Bipolar Disorder.  If you are in any way unsure of your emotional state or are struggling to stay afloat amidst a depressive episode, seek therapy. A therapist can help you to understand your depression and help you find ways to cope and prevent future depressive episodes.Therapy is a highly effective treatment for depression, as it helps you to explore possible causes, overcome your negative feelings, and begin to feel and behave normally again.Cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) is highly effective at treating depression. It helps you confront your negative thoughts and thought patterns into more positive patterns. You can learn to re-interpret your environment and your interactions in a more supportive way., For some, therapy coupled with medication can be helpful in treating symptoms of depression. Recognize that medication is not a cure-all and comes with risks.Seek out your medical provider or a psychiatrist to learn more about antidepressant medication.  Discuss possible side effects with your prescriber and learn the risks of going on medication.  If you experience an increase in suicidality due to medication, speak to your prescriber immediately.  If you begin taking medication for your depression, do not stop taking it immediately upon seeing results. Use as directed by your prescriber.  It’s important to feel loved and supported, but it is especially important if you struggle with depression. It can be easy to disengage from friends and family when you feel depressed, but spending time with friends can boost your mood. When deep in depression, make time for your friends, even if your body or mind wildly protest.You can also join a support group. Check out the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) at https://www.nami.org/ to connect to information about depression and how to find a support group.  The benefits of exercise for treating depression are strongly supported by a growing body of research. Some studies show that exercise alone can help alleviate symptoms of depression and prevent onset for the future. It can be difficult to motivate yourself to go to the gym or go for a walk-- especially when depression seems to drain all of your energy-- but find some motivation and get some exercise.Exercise can be as simple as walking 20-40 minutes each day. If you have a dog, commit to walking your dog each day for double the happiness boost.  If you struggle to find motivation to be active, remind yourself that once you get moving, you will not regret putting in the effort. It’s rare for somebody to leave the gym thinking “I totally wasted my time, I should not have gone.”  Get a workout buddy to help your motivation. Having some accountability can help you get to the gym.  Managing stress is one way to cope and prevent depression. Make a daily practice to do something that relaxes you (no, social media does not count). Try yoga, meditation, tai chi, or muscle relaxation techniques. You can also begin journaling or putting to use some creativity to draw, paint, or sew.For more information, check out Reduce Stress.

"You made a bad mistake. Big deal. You don't need to get angry about it. I'm sure others made mistakes too.;  , It helps decrease your chances of making a no-no.  Your parents tell you to shoot. Would you do it? Don't always listen to the crowd. If somebody tells you to pass at the wrong time, don't pass. You don't need to listen to bad teammates who only want the ball in their possession.  Don't give in to them. Tell them to back off and leave you alone. You don't need insults to haunt you. Insults can be very hurtful sometimes. That is why it is best to avoid them by simply saying 'ah, man,' or 'I should've let somebody else do that,' when you mess up. These are called confessions. Confessions are a great way for your teammates to forgive you. Sometimes they even comfort you.  Does it really matter who's dribble is that? Have you ever heard the occasional 'You copied my move!,' or the 'Copy cat! Get your own dribble!.' If so, tell them that you can do whatever you want. After all, it is a free world. Why do you think we make wiki-hows? Just for a sake of good? No. We make them to help others. Learning from others isn't just copying. See their movement of their body while playing a sport. You can look at other swimmers' strokes and learn from them. That is the way we learn. By example.  If you aren't real good at a sport. Try to practice them before you join a team. You need patience to continue your journey of playing a sport. Joining a team to early may cause depression due to insults in sporting abuse.  Practice with a friend so even if you mess up, nobody will yell at you. It is good to practice with family or friends because you are comfortable with them and may learn something from them too.  We need a heart to survive. This is just like we need a heart to play a sport. Without heart of the sport, skill will never come. Play with greatness and boldness in your sport and always play with your heart.  Have fun with the sport you are playing and never let anybody criticize you. Who knows? Maybe somebody insults you and in the next ten years your the greatest sport player in the world!

"With a preteen's new hormones, body development, the new pressure to fit in, more bullying and peer pressure, it's no surprise that they'll likely need some support. Although it might sound like second nature to go to a parent, for a preteen with these new problems it can be difficult to go to a parent, especially if they think they may be judged or punished. However, if the child seems not to want to talk about something, it's not your fault; it can actually be good for them to solve problems on their own. If the child has unexplained scars, marks or bruises; seems sad or upset even when something good happens; shows sign of an eating disorder; or is showing signs that (s)he may be abused, then it's time to step in.Take him\her to a doctor and get rid of the root problem. They will likely be mad, but they'll thank you for it in the future.;  , If you stress over it too much she'll think it's a scary, unnatural thing. If you tell every one she might be humiliated. It might be natural, but the fact that it happens from inside her body embarrasses her.  You can expect more responsibility out of them, but don't force responsibility that should be given to a teen or adult unless you are 100% sure that they can handle it and that they don't mind.  What they should do: Turn in schoolwork, study, clean their room etc.  What they might have to wait till they are older: Babysitting, taking care of a baby while you sleep etc.  For a preteen, it can be more relaxing than trying to talk to you with everyone else around, and can strengthen the bond.  Nobody wants to be called fat, ugly, bad etc. But do offer positive criticism. Example:  Positive: That's a great top you're wearing. Maybe it would look good with a scarf.  Negative: That's an ugly shirt. Try a scarf.  Just because your child is goth doesn't mean they are about to kill themselves.  There is a fine line between being fair and playing favorites. If they are the ones being favored, they might become spoiled or self-centered and may struggle keeping their spot. If they are not being favored, they will have lower self-esteem and be more sensitive. It also puts them at risk for depression.  Playing Favorites: Giving one child more gifts or attention, a less severe punishment even though they did the same thing, giving them different bedtimes even though they are the same age etc.  Being Fair: Giving more attention to a much younger child or baby, giving them an earlier bedtime than older siblings, etc  , Don't spoil them but don't be the only person to not give them a present on their birthday. When punishing, do not make it too harsh.  Preteens need privacy just as teens do. But if they are in privacy more than a few hours a day or skipping meals take them to a doctor. It might be a serious problem.  If they get a bad grade, just tell them you're there to help them if they need it. If they accidentally drop your favorite cup, tell them it's okay and you know it's not their fault.  Expecting them to be respectful and responsible is good. Pushing them to become someone else is not.  There's nothing wrong with expecting at least a few A's on a report card. But expecting all A's is setting standards too high; they will struggle often and will think they are not good enough for you.  Parents like this often want the best for their children, but they may end up causing more harm than good. Keep a close eye on them, but allow some freedom. Let them make little decisions once in a while. A good example is to give them an allowance and see if they spend it wisely.  Get messy in the mud, eat ice cream, or just have fun.  ","let them know you'll be there for them. if your preteen girl gets her period, don't make a huge deal out of it. remember, she is still a kid. occasionally do things together. don't criticize your preteen. don't judge them. never play favorites. always be fair. give them privacy when asked. don't punish them for accidents. don't push them into being a different person. don't set expectations too high. avoid being an overprotective parent. occasionally let your inner child out.

"Everybody has a skill or interest that they excel in and genuinely enjoy. If you don't think you have a talent, you probably just haven't found it yet. It’s often necessary to be persistent and try many things before you find one that suits you.  Similar types of people may also be attracted to the same activities. For example, adrenaline junkies may not be drawn to the quiet, slow pace of a knitting club, but someone who enjoys other quiet activities might be. Determining who you enjoy being around may help you figure out what you’ll enjoy.  Be patient. Change does not come all at once. It requires practice and time. It can be difficult to break out of old routines and meet new people or try new activities, especially if you’re busy (and who isn’t?). Persistence is the key.  Enroll in a class you're interested in, or pick up a new instrument or sport. Not only will you learn something new, you’ll meet others who are interested in learning too. Trying to learn something new can also be a safe and productive way to push yourself out of your comfort zone.  No matter how much money you make, you will not be happy if you spend your entire life doing something you hate. While not all of us are lucky enough to make a career out of our favorite hobby, it's important to at least devote some of your time to things that make you happy.  Doing things that are meaningful to you will help you feel more happy and fulfilled. Creative pursuits, such as art or music, can help you express your feelings and thoughts in productive, healthy ways.It’s a common myth that the people who succeed most in life are the most single-minded. They don’t let anything get in the way of their one goal, including taking time for themselves. Unfortunately, that can be a very unhealthy way of living. Try not to allow yourself to focus so much on one aspect of your life that you forget to nurture the other ones.If you’re chronically unhappy at your job, consider why. It’s possible that some changes could change how you feel about it. If the reason you’re unhappy is because you feel like your job isn’t meaningful, or isn’t in line with your values, consider finding another line of work., Life must be a balance between work and play. Focusing exclusively on one or the other will eventually lead to stagnation and monotonous daily routines. Humans adapt very quickly to positive events. Because of that, we can become desensitized to positive experiences, especially if that’s our only experience.Research has shown that when we’re squarely in our comfort zone, we aren’t as productive as we are when we step just beyond it.It’s important to seek out new experiences and interactions with others, even when those are a little scary. Doing so can help you achieve more.  Our desire to avoid discomfort and hurt can lead us to refuse flexibility. However, research shows that embracing vulnerability -- including the possibility that something will go wrong -- is crucial to experiencing all of life.Mindfulness meditation can be a good place to start. One of the goals of mindfulness is to become more aware of any repetitive thought patterns that may be getting in the way of self-awareness and self-acceptance. Find a class or do some research to find out what techniques work best for you.  ","explore your talents. do what you love. experiment with life. "
"Wood is harvested from trees, and planks can be made from the wood using the crafting table. Wood is a great basic material because it is cheap and easy to find in many biomes.;  , Stone is a common block, largely found underground and making up mountains. If mined using pickaxe, you can get cobblestone instead, which looks slightly different.  You can even make a basic stone generator (using glass, lava, and water), if you don't feel like mining for stone or cobblestone.  Quartz comes from building a Nether Reactor in Minecraft PE. This makes the blocks expensive in Survival Mode, but if you want to bring some white color into your buildings, it's the best way.  Sand is a common natural block, usually found near water or in desert biomes. This is an easy way to add beige into your color scheme and it's cheap if you're not wanting to invest too much time.  Coal is a material that you'll have to mine, but it's pretty common. This is the easiest way to bring black into your color scheme. Remember that you'll have to smelt the coal from ore, and the original blocks look very much like spotted cobblestone. Don't miss them!  , You can build a basic house that resembles your real life home or any cliché looking house. Using stairs to make a roof and avoiding pure box shapes can help a lot in making even a basic house look really nice.  Using cobblestone or regular stone, make yourself a castle complete with dungeon. You can even use Green wool to make yourself a giant dragon to slay! Look at pictures of real medieval castles to get ideas on the layout you want.  Fences are useful for making turrets at the tops of towers.  Using a few tricks, you can make an underwater house in Minecraft PE. Simply build the walls up to the water's surface, fill the inside with dirt, seal the house, and then remove the dirt.  Flex your creativity and create a super modern house. You can use the clean box lines and walls of glass panes to create a very cool looking house. These look great perched on a cliff.  Bring out the 'mine' in Minecraft and build yourself a Bat Cave. You can even include a waterfall entrance. Batmobile not included...unless you build that too.  Building a mansion over the cave can add even more fun. Use redstone or other clever tricks (command blocks, if you hack your game) to make things like an elevator that takes you down to the cave.  Build a giant tree and then make yourself a house that either hugs around the trunk and branches or actually fits inside the trunk itself. You can even make a whole village this way and use it to hang out with your friends.  Use quartz and column blocks to make a cool Roman palace. You can even build a temple to yourself inside! Don't forget a pool out front and a road lined with Cypress trees to seal the deal!  , It's not a small building project by any means, but who wouldn't want to have their own Hogwarts to have adventures in. Make classrooms, the Great Hall, your house's dorm, the greenhouse, the library, and any other parts of the castle you can't live without. Don't forget the lake out front and the Quidditch pitch!  , Build a skyscraper and fill it with apartments. You can use mods to add command blocks and use the command block to build an elevator that takes you to your apartment. You don't have to fill out every apartment of course. Maybe a few for your friends...but save the penthouse for yourself!  , Build yourself a pirate ship and live aboard! Remember that the bigger you make the boat, the more detail you can create. Just be careful not to get scurvy!  Glass panes make good sails for a pirate ship.  Use different colored blocks to mark the different parts of your foundation. For example, use blue wool to mark the corners of your walls and red wool to mark the locations for redstone circuits. Place these blocks in the first ground layer so that you can build right on top of them. This lets you make sure that everything is lined up and can also help you figure out how much material you need.  Build houses using materials that you can easily gather. Otherwise, be ready to invest in a long project. This can be fun though! Just play in a way that's fun for you.  Always, always, always build the exterior walls first. This is often the hardest part of building, so getting it done first will help keep you motivated to finish. It's also important for keeping everything lined up and looking good. This is how real life building works too!  Building the exterior first also has the added benefit of letting you get the ceilings up, which means you get to stay out of the rain and snow.  You can really build a cool house in just about any shape you want. All you have to do to make it cool is make it not boring! You can do this by avoiding blocky overall shapes to your house (having one giant square or rectangle) and also by avoiding too-flat walls. Use outcroppings, towers, and wings to make your house more interesting. You should also break up the colors of the outside walls and ceiling. Having everything in just one color makes it look like a blob!  , Another key part of making a house interesting is to make sure that you don't neglect the landscaping. A cool house in the middle of a completely empty plain is pretty boring. Make any house more interesting by adding a garden, lake, street, or other decorations to keep the environment looking cool.  You can find a number of pre-made building plans online, showing you exactly how to make all sorts of different buildings yourself. This is great for beginners, who haven't gotten used to the materials available to them yet.  Minecraft Building Inc is one great example.  There are a couple of sites on the net that will let you create your own building plans, drawing out exactly what materials should go where. The most common site for this is MineDraft.  There are loads of videos on YouTube that show you how to build cool houses and other fun structures. Spend some time exploring and getting ideas for what other people have made.

"While there are different methods you can use to remove caulk. Get ride of old caulk by slicing it off with a razor scraper, utility knife, or five-in-one painter's tool.  Using quick, sharp strokes, slice through the length of the old caulk and peel off the majority of the loosened caulk using your fingers.  Note that metal blades and chemical caulk removers can damage plastic tubs. Use a plastic razor if your tub or shower is made of plastic, not ceramic.;  , Scrub the sides of the shower with a dry, nonabrasive pad or sponge to wipe away all residue left behind by the old caulk.  When done, wipe the area down with a damp, soft rag to remove any caulk dust. Dry thoroughly with a dry rag, hair dryer, or paper towels.  If your old caulk was made of silicone, you will need to use a pad soaked in mineral spirits. Use a soft rag, however, and not an abrasive one.  Place two strips of tape equidistant from either side of each joint being caulked. The lines of tape should run parallel to each other and be spaced roughly 3/8 inch (9.5 mm) apart from each other.  The tape is used to help keep the bead of caulk straight and uniform.  When selecting a caulk for your shower, use one labeled 'Tub and Tile' or 'Kitchen and Bath,' as these are usually chemically formulated to resist mildew and stick the smooth surfaces like your shower.  In particular, there are two types of caulk usually used for showers: silicone and acrylic latex.  Silicone is very flexible, tough, and waterproof. On the downside, it can also be difficult to smooth and may require the use of mineral spirits to clean up. The color range can also be fairly limited.  Acrylic latex is easier to apply, clean up, and smooth. It also comes in a wider range of colors. On the downside, it dries harder and shrinks more than silicone caulk does, so acrylic latex caulk will probably have a shorter lifespan.  Trim the nozzle of the caulk tube near the tip, cutting it off at a 45 degree angle.  The hole should only be big enough to fill the joint. As a general rule, the hole of the tube should actually be about 2/3 the size of the actual joint needing to be filled. The measurement for most showers should be about 3/16 inch (4.8 mm).  Use a utility knife with a fresh blade or a 1-inch (2.5-cm) wide, razor-sharp chisel to cut the tip off the nozzle.  Note that some nozzles actually need to be punched in order to begin the caulking flow. If a nail does not prove long enough, use thin, stiff wire like electrical wire or a coat hanger.  Some tubes of caulk will even have a line on the nozzle to indicate the point at which you should cut.  If your initial cut produces a bead that is too small, you can cut a little more off the tip.  If a piece of plastic remains hanging on the nozzle after being cut, pare it down with your utility knife to remove it completely before starting. Otherwise, this little burr can prevent the caulk from being smooth.  To improve the process even further, use 100-grit sandpaper to smooth and right the tip a bit.  Cheaper guns tend to be less predictable and may lead to sloppier application, but a professional gun applies more consistent pressure.  A professional level gun does not need to cost a lot, either. Power caulk guns can be very pricey, but all you need is a professional hand-powered caulk gun, which might fit into your budget better.  A cradle caulking gun will produce the best, most even pressure and is a better long-term investment than a frame caulking gun. If using the latter, though, at least make sure to look for one labeled as being 'dripless.'  , Release the pressure off the handle once you see the caulk at the tip and clean off any excess with a moist rag.  This precaution brings the caulk right up to the tip of the caulk tube, so it will be ready for use once you bring it up to the shower joint.  The nozzle should be positioned at a 45 degree angle out from the joint.  The tube tip should directly meet the surface of the joint.  Press the trigger gently to release the caulk bead into the joint. As you move the caulk gun along the length of the joint, continue applying even pressure to create an even line.  You can either push or pull the gun. It is entirely a matter of preference, so do whichever option feels most comfortable to you.  If you are right-handed, you might find it best to brace the nozzle with your left hand and squeeze the handle with your right. For left-handed individuals, try the opposite.  After squeezing your nozzle the first time, do not squeeze it again until there is a good size drop coming out of the nozzle.  If the rate at which the caulk is flowing differs too much from the rate at which you move the caulk gun, you could end up with a messy situation.  If you move the caulk gun too fast, the bead will become too thin and will break too quickly.  If you move the caulk gun too slow, you will end up wasting caulk and creating more mess.  Caulk should only be used to temporarily patch up small patches of missing grout in between tiles. If a large amount of grout is missing, caulk is not a good substitution.  Ultimately, patching up missing grout with more grout is a better alternative, but it can be difficult to do without the exact shade of grout used.  For larger patches of missing grout, you will need to scrape the old grout out with an oscillating tool equipped with a tile blade before re-grouting.  Even if you do use caulk to temporarily repair a few small gaps in your tile grouting, you should not treat this as a permanent solution. If the grout is getting old, you will need to replace it sooner or later.  Look for areas where holes have already developed. Chip away the grout surrounding the hole to get rid of the weakened grout around that hole.  Work carefully so that you do not crack the tile by accident.  Quickly swipe a small bead or line of caulk over the hole to fill it in. Hold the tip of the nozzle at a 45 degree angle from the hole itself.  Use even pressure as you drag the caulk gun over the hole, and work at a pace that roughly matches the pace of the caulk gun to avoid making excess messes.  As with shower joints, it is not necessarily a bad idea to apply painter's tape around the crack in the grout to prevent caulk from getting on the surrounding tile.  You should either use dampened fingers or a moist, lint-free cloth rag to smooth out the bead of caulk immediately after applying it.  If using a rag, press it into and along the caulk with your finger to apply the appropriate amount of pressure.  Work in a continuous motion to avoid inconsistencies and to create a smooth, concave line.  If you can do both at once, you can save yourself time by placing the tip of your index finger over the joint as you caulk. By applying a small amount of even and consistent downward pressure, you can apply and smooth the caulk at once  If using your fingertip, clean your finger off periodically with a damp rang to prevent the caulk from smearing everywhere.  Smoothing is essential for both aesthetic and practical purposes. During the smoothing process, the caulk is forced to adhere more securely to the surface it fills.  For many silicone caulks, you will need to wipe down the excess caulk with a soft cloth rag soaked in mineral spirits.  Wear a disposable nitrile, latex, or vinyl glove to protect your finger from wear and tear. It also makes the process much easier to clean up afterward since the glove can simply be removed and thrown away.  Peel the tape off slowly and do not let it touch any of the fresh caulk.  If the tape left 'ridges' of caulk behind, you should clean these up by smoothing the area out again with a damp rag or damp finger.  Pull the tape off at a downward, outward angle.  You should wait for at least 24 hours before running the water or using the shower.  If you run the water over the caulk before it finishes curing, you might rinse some of it away or cause it to smear and run, creating a big mess.

"In the Oracle of Seasons, Aquamentus guards the Boss Room of the “Gnarled Root Dungeon,” the first dungeon of you need to complete in this version. Enter the Boss Room of this level by unlocking it using the Boss Key you acquired while playing through the dungeon.  Once inside, Aquamentus will start firing three balls of fire at you, vertically aligned. As these balls of fire come near you it will start separating from each other, giving you a very large space to walk between these fireballs.  If you do get hit by any of these fireballs, you will incur damage equal to half a heart container. Make sure that you get hit as least as many times as possible.  In Oracle of Seasons, Aquamentus has a new attack. After hitting its horn around more than three times, it will start flapping its wings to fly up and come slamming down at you. This attack is pretty simple to avoid. Once Aquamentus gets up in the air, you’ll see a circle spot moving around the floor—this is the dragon’s shadow. The shadow will tell you where the dragon will land. So just keep stepping out of the shadow and you’ll be fine.  If you've slipped through the gaps between the fireballs and dodged the Slam attack, you’ll find your character much closer to Aquamentus. Using your sword, slash at the single horn protruding from its head and Aquamentus will start blinking, signifying that you've successfully damaged it.  Once Aquamentus has sustained enough damage (around 5 to 7 sword slash), it will explode and turn into a heart container.  ","enter the boss room. dodge the fireball attacks. dodge the slam attack. attack his horns. "
"The first thing you need to do is determine what areas of your home your ferret will be able to roam freely in. Once you decide this, you’ll then be able to focus most of your energies on making sure these rooms are safe and can contain your ferret from escaping. Most of your efforts will focus on making sure that there are no dangers or easy escape routes that will enable your friend to get out of your home.  Pick an area of your home that is easy to block off.  Consider a bonus room or a master suite in which you can close the door.  Avoid high-hazard places like the garage, kitchen, or laundry room.;  , While you’ve already done some work ferret-proofing the area that your ferret will roam in, now you need to make sure that all escape routes in your home are blocked. The reason you need to do this is that although the area you’ve cordoned off is now safe, your ferret could still find his or her way into the other areas of your house. From there, freedom could be as easy as a doggie door or an open window.  Make sure all doors shut correctly.  Close all windows and other entrances into your home.  Repair any structural problems that could offer your ferret a way out of your home. , Chemical hazards are one of the most common dangers to dogs, cats, babies, and of course ferrets. In order to protect your friend from these hazards, make sure your home is chemical free. After all, the danger of your ferret ingesting a chemical is much scarier than the work it would take to remove chemical hazards from your home.  Remove poisons and pesticides.  Secure household cleaning products in a closet or cabinet that your ferret can’t access.  Secure garden fertilizers and similar chemicals so that your ferret can’t get into them. , Electrical hazards might be one of the biggest dangers to your friend. This is because as very curious little animals, ferrets will explore and even chew on things in order to figure out what they are. In order to avoid danger to your ferret, scout out any potential electrical hazards and fix them.  Coat electrical cords with a bitter solution to repel chewing.  Wrap electrical cords with electrical tape or other appropriate material to provide an extra layer of protection.  Hook the cords to the wall about a foot or two from the ground.  Plug up any vacant outlets with protectors., If there are certain things you really care about and don’t want chewed on, pick them up. While ferrets are not really destructive animals, sometimes (depending on age and other conditions) they might chew on plastic, rubber, or even wood.  Pick up new shoes.  Move or box up collector’s items or children’s toys that you don’t want damaged.  Pick up expensive clothes., Household appliances represent huge and common dangers to ferrets that ferret owners should be aware of. This is because many appliances in our homes offer warm places to explore and are easy to get into. In addition to climbing inside the back of an appliance, there are a variety of other appliance-related dangers. Consider:  That your ferret might like to sleep in dirty laundry and can easily get thrown in the washer or dryer by accident.  Always checking inside your dishwasher or oven before running them.  Making sure your ferret can’t get inside the back of your refrigerator or freezer.  Securing any large appliances that might have holes small enough for your ferret to climb inside., One way to keep your ferret out of trouble is to keep him or her occupied. The best way to do this is to provide your friend with toys and other things to play with. Consider:  A ferret maze. Ferrets are very inquisitive and like to explore and play. Buy or build a maze for your ferret to play in. You can purchase one at a pet store or build one out of cardboard or other materials.  Buying your ferret balls, crinkle toys, or other plastic toys to chew on.  Playing with your ferret and find out what he or she likes to do. This way, you'll be in a better position when it comes to supplying your ferret with toys., Communicating with everyone you live with is extremely important in ferret-proofing your home. Although you’ve gone out of your way to make your home safe for your little friend, other people (if they are careless) could easily undermine all of your work. Make sure to:  Talk to roommates or family about your ferret and things that pose a danger to him or her.  Explain to your roommates and family about how your ferret could easily get out if they don’t close doors and windows.  Remind your roommates and family of your efforts to ferret proof the house every couple of weeks – so they don’t forget or get lazy.  Put up signs to remind people that your home is a ferret-friendly zone., One of the most common ways that ferrets get out of people’s homes is when there are visitors who don’t realize how important it is to close doors after themselves. As a result, whenever you have visitors to your home, make sure you put your ferret away. This will help you avoid the horrible situation of a friend accidently letting your ferret slip outside., Take some time to remove small hazards that you or your family might leave around the home. This, though, will really be an on-going battle as you and your family will constantly be creating small hazards for your ferret. The biggest dangers to consider are:  Small pieces of plastic that your ferret might chew on and swallow.  Garbage with food on it that might be toxic to your ferret.  Garbage like aluminum cans and plastic that could injure your friend if he or she were to investigate it., While it may be tempting to let your ferret roam freely in the same area of your home as your dog or cat, this could be extremely dangerous for the ferret. As a small animal, ferrets are extremely vulnerable to larger pets – especially cats – who have well-developed predator instincts. In addition, ferrets are not harmless themselves. They’re actually very capable hunters and can deal out considerable damage to larger animals.  Set aside a room or part of your house just for the ferret. Restrict other animals from this area.  If you think your ferret needs a companion, consider another ferret.  If you must let your ferret and another pet roam together, make sure to introduce them slowly and then monitor their interactions very carefully.  Never leave your ferret and another pet unattended while you are not at home., When your ferret is freely exploring your home, you should monitor he or she closely. Watch where he or she goes. Take note of his or her favorite places to hide or to play in. Chances are, your ferret will wind up in places you never considered.  After watching your friend, make sure that any places you’ve neglected to ferret-proof are now safe.  Consider re-thinking the area that you’ve ferret-proofed if your ferret finds clever ways to escape or get into trouble. After all, a little work is worth avoiding the heartbreak of losing your little friend.  Tell your friends and family about places your ferret likes to go. This could be extra important if your friend likes to crawl into a couch, arm chair, or go behind a door.  Ferrets are very small and agile. They’re not like dogs and cannot be restricted or penned up the way dogs are. As a result, you need to be aware of your ferret’s capabilities and what they can and cannot do. Knowing your ferret’s capabilities may save you a lot of time when it comes to ferret-proofing your home.  Ferrets will climb walls, fences, or other obstacles to get where they want to go.  Ferrets are very small and get through cracks under doors and other spaces that you really wouldn’t expect.  Ferrets can also be very adept jumpers and can jump from a table to another table, down stairs, or more., Ferrets can be litter trained just like cats. As a result, one aspect of ferret-proofing your house is to make sure your ferret does not mess in your home. In order to avoid this, make sure to provide your ferret a litter box and to litter train your little friend. By litter training your ferret, you’ll avoid potential messes and make your ferret a much more well-adjusted member of your family.  When your ferret is young, and is not house trained, make sure to put litter and a litter tray in your ferret’s cage.  When your ferret messes outside of the litter tray, move his or her mess into the tray.  Clean the litter tray at least once a week., There are a variety of household foods that, if consumed, can harm your ferret. These foods are foods that people commonly consume and might be left out in the open on a regular basis. When you add a free-ranging ferret to this, you have a potentially dangerous combination that could result in your ferret going to the vet. Avoid:  Dairy products. Ferrets can't digest dairy. Keep dairy away from them at all costs.  Garlic and onions.  Sugar.  Fruits and vegetables.  Grains, when possible. Some ferret food will contain grain. This is okay.  ","determine where your ferret will roam. block all escape routes. identify chemical hazards. fix any electrical hazards. pick up anything that you don’t want destroyed. anticipate common dangers. provide your ferret with toys and entertainment. talk to everyone who lives in your home. put your ferret away when people come to visit. gather garbage or small pieces of plastic. avoid letting your ferret play with other pets. monitor your ferret closely. understand that ferrets are very small and agile. provide a litter box. learn about foods that are dangerous to ferrets.

"Many health experts in the US and Australia recommend avoiding this method, since harmful bacteria on the shell could get in contact with the egg.The risk of contamination is much lower in the EU, which has a very effective anti-salmonella program.If you're concerned about the risk, use one of the other methods instead.  Cooking yolks or whites until firm makes them much safer.If you plan to serve the eggs runny or raw, consider another separation method.  Room temperature eggs have runnier whites, which can make this method messy and difficult. Work with eggs straight from the fridge instead.  This is where you want to make the cleanest crack you can manage. The key with this method is to crack the egg evenly, so you can easily transfer the yolk between the two halves.  Tap the center of the egg gently against a hard object, so a crack forms across about half of the egg. The edge of a bowl is a good surface for getting two equal halves. The edge can also break off shell fragments into your white, though, so a flat counter might be better if your eggs have thin shells., Hold the egg over a bowl in both hands with the crack facing upward and the wide end tilted down. Slowly pull apart the two halves with your thumbs, until the egg breaks into two halves. Because the egg is tilted, the yolk should fall into the lower half., 'Pour' the intact yolk back and forth between the two halves of the shell. Repeat this about three times, while the white drips over the side of the shell and into the bowl below.  Drop the yolk in another bowl once there are only tiny bits of white stuck to it. If you have more eggs to separate, consider using a third bowl, so a messy crack doesn't drop shell shards or broken yolk into your whites. Separate each egg over this third bowl, then empty the bowl into the other whites bowl before you move on to the next.  ","understand the risks. chill the eggs (optional). imagine a line going around the 'fattest' part of the egg. start the crack on the egg. carefully break apart the shell. transfer the yolk from shell to shell. drop the yolk in another bowl.

"Unplug the machine so you can handle it safely. Never work on the interior of a machine while it still has power, or you could be electrocuted or injured by moving parts.  Choose a bucket you can easily lift when filled with water.  An unpowered machine should not allow more water to enter the system. If you want to be extra safe, find the supply hoses leading from the back of the machine, and disconnect them where they meet the plumbing. The supply hose or hoses are smooth, not rippled. Disconnect them by turning each valve so it runs across the pipe, instead of along it.A cold-only supply is grey or blue. If there is a second supply hose for hot water, it is usually red. Both hoses are smooth.  The drain hose is grey and rippled, similar to a vacuum cleaner hose. Detach it on the plumbing end by removing the twist tie, or by unscrewing the hose clamp if present. Ease off the hose, which may be firmly attached. Do not lower the hose or let it fall to the ground.  If there's a kink in the hose, this could be the problem. Straighten the hose, restore water and power, and run a spin cycle to see if the machine drains. If not, shut off water and power again and continue to the next step.  Lots of waste water will flow out quite quickly. When the bucket is mostly full, lift the hose back up and reattach it to its connection again while you empty the bucket. Repeat until no more water leaves the hose.  If you empty the bucket into the same sink that feeds your machine, pour slowly. There's a chance that some water will flow through the open connection to the hoses.  When the water flow slows, tilt the bucket forward so you can bring the hose closer to the ground  If no water comes out, there is probably a blockage in the hose. Clearing this or replacing the hose may fix your problem.  This next part usually gets messy. Lay a few dirty towels on the floor, against the front of the machine. Tuck them under the machine if possible.  On some machines, a thin baking tray can fit under the gap between the floor and the base of the machine. Use this as well as the towels if possible.  Some machines have a blank plastic cover over this area, while others have a small 'door.' On a front-loaded machine, either type is usually located on the front of the machine, near the base. Look up instructions for your model, or search for and disconnect it on your own:  Most plastic covers are attached by plastic tabs. These break easily, so work slowly and methodically. Tug repeatedly until each tab unlatches, without using excessive force.  Square, door-like ports are sometimes attached by tabs as well, but some have a simple handle.  Round plugs often have a retaining screw, which you'll need to remove and set aside. Slowly twist the plug anticlockwise (this may require force). If water seeps out, wait until it's all come out before you remove the plug completely. If necessary, tighten the plug again while you replace the soaked towels.  Once the port is removed, you should see the pump on the other side. Use a crochet needle, a wire with the end bent back, or a similar small item to reach into the pump.

"To get into an elbow stand comfortably, you’re going to need some space. Find an open, flat section of floor that’s big enough to accommodate the length of your body. That way if you lose your balance while holding the elbow stand, you won’t have to worry about colliding with any obstacles nearby.  Start learning the elbow stand on a carpeted floor, or outside on grass. This will give you a softer surface to work with until your forearms are conditioned to the strain of the technique, and it will hurt less if you fall.;  , Start in a standard downward dog position, or in quarter dog, kneeling with both knees on the ground and your weight over your hips. Place both forearms out in front of you with palms flat on the floor (this is known as 'dolphin pose'). Your forearms should be parallel or in a slight “V” shape, tapering toward the hands.The forearms are used as the base for the elbow stand. They should be roughly 10-12 inches apart to provide maximum stability and put them in the best position to make balance adjustments.It’s important to be low enough in your starting position to be able to get both forearms on the ground in front of you without the need to contort uncomfortably.  Walk your feet up as close to your elbows as you can can and get up on the balls of your feet to prepare to push off the floor. Swing your first leg up behind you to begin lifting your body into a vertical position. Allow your other leg to come up behind the first. Once inverted, your head should be in alignment with the rest of the body, positioned between the forearms with your gaze fixed down on the hands rather than to the rear of the body. Extend both legs toward the ceiling so that the body is completely upright. Straighten your knees and point your toes for proper alignment.Learn to get a feel for how hard to kick up with your first leg. Not kicking hard enough will cause you to fall right back down into your starting position, while kicking up with too much force might make you to overshoot your balance point and can potentially lead to shoulder injuries if the arms are wrenched behind you.Keeping the body perfectly aligned from head to toe will make balancing easier by preventing any awkward displacements of weight from pulling you down.  After you’re inverted and upright, you’ve completed the hardest part of the movement! Now all you need to do is hold the position by maintaining your balance. Keep your body tight and use small adjustments of your forearms to keep the body from falling off its axis. Take advantage of your base by using the entire forearm to keep balance. This will feel unusual at first, but is a very stable position as long as the body is kept in line.If your body is leaning too far forward, press with the palms to counter the movement; If you find yourself falling backwards, tense the core by squeezing the abdominal muscles and thrust your elbows into the floor while extending your shoulders.  The straighter you can keep your body, the more effortless balancing will be.  It’s recommended that you master the basic headstand before moving on to the elbow stand, which removes the crown as a balance point. Try doing a few headstands a day during your training sessions and work up in short intervals until you can hold the position for a minute or longer. The headstand makes use of the same muscle groups as the elbow stand and also serves as good inversion practice.Bridge the gap between the headstand and elbow stand by doing yoga headstands, in which the forearms are also used for base stability and balance., If you’re scared of getting inverted or becoming disoriented once you’re in position, you may need do some conditioning to get yourself used to being upside down. This can be accomplished by simply spending more time with the head below the body. Inch your way up into a steep dolphin pose, practice basic headstands against the wall with a pillow support or hang off the edge of your bed until inversion is no longer intimidating or uncomfortable.You can also perform elbow stands against the wall to build up the amount of time you’re able to spend inverted under tension. This will take the balance aspect out of the movement and allow you to focus on building up the shoulder and core strength necessary to hold the elbow stand for longer., You should always warm up and stretch lightly before any type of physical activity, but this goes double for complex and challenging postures like the elbow stand. Stretching the neck and shoulders thoroughly prior to practicing elbow stands will ensure that you have full mobility of the muscles, making it easier to get into and hold the position. Stretching also reduces your risk of injury by making the joints more supple.Stretch the shoulders and neck independently by putting them through their maximal range of motion, or by transitioning through a sequence of other yoga postures.  Shoulder strength is an essential function to the stability of the elbow stand. To build strength in the shoulders, perform standard push ups and push up variations that target the muscles of the shoulders specifically. While doing these exercises, concentrate on moving your weight in a slow, controlled manner.Pike and Hindu push ups approximate the positioning of the body during the elbow stand particularly well.Holding handstands against a wall will also be useful for building the necessary supporting strength in the arms and shoulders.  The shoulders support your body, but the core does most of the work in keeping your body in a straight line and maintaining balance. For this reason, core exercises like crunches, V-sits, and leg lifts should be utilized. When performed statically, the core muscles will spend more time in a contracted state, which translates directly to the constant tension of an elbow stand.To perform static core exercises, begin the exercise normally and then hold it in the hardest portion of the movement (for crunches, this will be in a full crunch; for V-sits and leg lifts, the legs should be kept at about a 45 degree angle to the body, etc.)Incorporate core strength exercises into your weekly training following your regular workouts.  To add another degree of difficulty to the elbow stand once you’ve got it down, try entering the posture from a pike. Rather than kicking up one leg at a time, keep both feet together and bring them as close to the forearms as you can. Then, lean forward to place your center of gravity over your forearm base, engage the core and lift both legs off floor, keeping them together as you extend into the inversion. The piked entry is an intensified technique that requires loads of upper body and core strength to pull off correctly.The pike shifts emphasis to the frontal abdominals, meaning that your core muscles need to be quite well-developed.  The simplest positions for entering into an elbow stand demand that you be close to the floor, so doing an elbow stand from a standing position means that your technique, stability and balance must be spot-on. Start in a walking stance, with one foot slightly in front of the other (the leg you intend to kick up with should be in the back). Bend at the hips, reaching down to place the forearms on the ground as you lift with the back leg in one continuous movement. The technical complexity of this variation makes it ideal for beginning to learn handstands.  It may be helpful to “catch” your weight with your hands before resting the forearms on the ground in order to compensate for the added distance between your body and the floor.  When you feel like your ability to balance in an elbow stand is coming along, you can gradually relax and separate the legs until they’re flared. Bring the toes of one leg horizontally toward the floor with the knee straightened while letting the other fall behind the body so that the sole of the foot is pointed ahead of you. Split leg inversions are typically reserved for high-level yoga practitioners and demonstrate superb understanding and control of the body’s balancing mechanics.Staying upright will be made much more complicated, as the legs now must move independently to offset one another’s weight., One of the most advanced techniques in yoga, dance and gymnastics, pulling off a scorpion requires that the practitioner arch their back to bring the feet as close as possible to the back of the head. This will be especially hard while maintaining an elbow stand. Scorpion inversion demand great flexibility, agility and strength. Once you’re able to achieve this posture you can consider yourself as having mastered the elbow stand.To successfully perform a scorpion, the neck, back, hip flexors and quadriceps must be warmed up and limber. Make sure you’re on an intensive stretching regimen to build up flexibility before attempting the scorpion.This technique places the neck and back in an awkward position, making falls potentially dangerous. If you find yourself falling, always come out of the posture by gradually straightening the back and bringing the hips down until your feet rest on the ground beneath you.  ","find an open space on flat ground. get into position to initiate the lift. kick one leg up behind you, followed by the other. maintain your balance using your forearms. practice headstands. get used to being upside down. stretch your neck and shoulders. perform push ups to increase shoulder strength. hold static positions to condition the core muscles. pike into the elbow stand. enter the elbow stand from a standing position. practice separating your legs. perform a scorpion elbow stand.

"String and bait catching is a simple way of catching crawfish and makes for a fun family activity. All you need is a fishing pole, rod or stick, some fishing line or string, and some bait.  You can attach the bait to the string using a fish hook or even a safety pin - this will ensure that the bait remains attached to the string and prevents the crawfish from getting away.  Lower the bait into the water and wait patiently until you feel a tug on the end of the string. Then slowly move the crawfish and bait as close to the shore as possible before gently pulling it out of the water. Immediately place the crawfish into a bucket.  If you like, you can use a fishnet with a long handle to scoop up the crawfish as soon as your reel them in. This will prevent them from releasing the bait and getting away.;  , Traps are the best way to catch large quantities of crawfish with relatively little effort. So if you want to feed your friends and family a crawfish feast, this is the way to go.  There are two main types of traps: open traps, which are basically collapsible nets that are open on one end, and closed traps, a more advanced variety with a funnel on one end which allows the crawfish to enter the trap, but prevents them from escaping.  Avoid using square-shaped traps as these can catch on rocks at the bottom of the water and become trapped or broken. Cylindrical-, conical- and beehive-shaped traps are all better options. Crawfish traps should be less than three feet in height, width and depth.Before you lower the traps into the water, you will need to bait them. Some traps have a hook in the center to which you can attach the bait, while other require the use of bait boxes or bait jars.  Open traps can be left in the water for several hours at a time, as long as there is enough bait, while closed traps can be left overnight. With any luck, when you pull the trap up again it will be filled with crawfish. Under the right conditions, you can catch 15 to 20 pounds of crawfish per trap!, A third option for catching crawfish is just to catch them by hand, as they are often found amongst the rocks in shallow pools and can easily be picked up -- just watch out for those sharp claws!  To catch a crawfish by hand, you will need to find a pond, creek or lake that is well known for its crawfish population. Crawfish typically like to hide under rocks and plants in the shallow parts of the water.  To catch a crawfish, wade into the water and look for rocks that seem likely to be hiding a crawfish. Then very slowly reach your hand into the water and gently lift up the rock. If you lift it too quickly it can startle the crawfish and stir up mud which obstructs your vision, allowing the crawfish to scurry away.  If you lift the rock correctly, you should see a crawfish just sitting underwater. Now you have two options. The first option is just to pick the crawfish up with your bare hands. If it's very small, you can reach your hands into the water and cup it between both hands. If it's larger, you can pick it up using the thumb and forefinger of one hand, just behind the pinchers.  Your second option is to use a small bucket and stick. Gently place the bucket 4 to 6 inches (10.2 to 15.2 cm) behind the crawfish, then wave the stick in front of it or give it a light tap. Crawfish swim backwards, so it should swim directly into the bucket. Once it's in there, scoop the bucket out of the water.Whatever you do, don't blindly thrust your hand into the water, or you could get a nasty pinch!  , In many states, a fishing license is required to catch crawfish. However once this license is acquired, you can catch as many crawfish as you like, 365 days a year.  Family fishing licenses (which entitles any member of the family to fish) are available for purchase at your local state department, for a fee of approximately $60.  When using crawfish traps, the license number must be engraved on or attached to the trap, along with your name and address., Crawfish are most active during the warmer months of the year, so the best time to go fishing for them is between April and October. However, it is still possible to catch crawfish during the colder months, just don't expect to find as many.  Crawfish are freshwater crustaceans and can be found in many bodies of water across the U.S.A. and in countries around the world.  They make their homes in streams, ponds and lakes, in addition to canals, reservoirs, springs and bedrock pools.  Most crawfish seem to prefer still or slow-moving water, with plenty of rocks and vegetation to provide cover.  Crawfish are nocturnal, which means they are most active at night, especially in warmer waters or during the summer months. Therefore, many people will set out to catch crawfish at dusk, or will leave traps in the water overnight and collect them in the morning.  If you plan on leaving traps in the water overnight, make sure to attach a piece of string tied around a cork. This will allow you to find the traps easily in the light of day.  However, crawfish can still be tempted by bait during the day, so catching them during daylight hours is not impossible.  Go fishing at whatever time works for you. Just remember that nighttime crawfishing expeditions can be a lot of fun!  , The best bait to use for crawfishing is widely debated, however most sources will agree that you can't go wrong with the heads, tails and guts of oily fish which are native to the local area.  Fish like salmon, herring, carp, perch, walleye and trout all work well as crawfish bait, but things like sardines, squid, clams, sole and eel will not.  Other options include any kind of fatty, raw meat such as chicken or pork. Crawfish are also attracted to pieces of hot dog and even fish-based cat food (though some crawfish experts would disagree with this).  The most important thing when it comes to bait is that the meat is fresh. Crawfish will not be attracted to old, spoiled or smelly meat, contrary to popular belief., When you are using traps to catch crawfish, it is essential that the bait is properly secured.  With some basic traps, the bait is simply hung from a hook in the center of the trap. This works well, but if the traps are left underwater for too long, the crawfish will eat all of the bait, then lose interest and escape from the trap.  Therefore, many crawfish experts recommend using bait boxes - these allow the crawfish to feed and enable the smell of the bait to disperse through the water, attracting more crawfish. But because the bait is less accessible, it will not be eaten as quickly, so the crawfish remain in the trap for longer.  Another option is bait jars - these allow the smell of the bait to disperse through the water, but do not allow the crawfish to feed. The bait will last for longer, but the crawfish are not as likely to stay in the trap once they realize that they cannot feed.  Crawfish contain a delicious sweet white meat which can be eaten on its own or used in a variety of southern-style dishes such as crawfish jambalaya, crawfish etouffee and crawfish bisque. Crawfish can also replace other shellfish such as lobster and crab in most dishes.  First, kill the crawfish by thrusting a sharp knife between the head and thorax, or by submerging them in ice or boiling water for several minutes.  To cook them, boil a pot of plain water and add some salt, black pepper and cayenne for authentic Acadian seasoning. Rinse any mud or debris off the crawfish with clean water.  If you wish to purge the vein inside the crawfish (intestines) before cooking, mix half a cup of salt or white vinegar with a bucket of clean water and leave the crawfish to soak in it for 30 minutes. When the water turns murky, they are ready to cook.  Place the whole crawfish (or just the tails and large claws) into the pot of boiling water and leave for approximately 5 minutes, or until the shells turn bright red. If you like, you can add additional ingredients to the water such as seafood boil, onions, jalapenos or cilantro.  Eat the crawfish on their own, dipped in butter and lemon juice or covered in cocktail sauce. Serve with corn on the cob and boiled potatoes for a hearty post-fishing lunch or dinner. , Some people like to keep crawfish as pets, as they are easy to care for and are fascinating for children to watch. Sometimes they can even be brought to school and kept as a classroom pet!  Transport the crawfish by keeping them somewhere damp and cool. Do not place the crawfish in a bucket of water as most species need to oxygen to survive and will die in stagnant water. As long as the crawfish is kept moist, it can survive out of water for several days.  Keep the crawfish in an oxygenated aquarium on its own, as it will eat other fish. It can feed off any vegetation you place in the aquarium or you can feed it fish heads and trimmings, fatty meats or any of the bait described above.  Be aware that some states forbid people from taking live crawfish away from their capture site. Some states (such as Arizona) forbid people from taking live crawfish home - they must be killed at the site of capture. So if you are considering bringing a crawfish home for a pet, make sure to look up your state's regulations first.

"Get rid of useless clothes, old papers, and broken things that you're not planning to fix. Donate any items that might still be usable to someone else, and throw out or recycle the rest.  When you're going through your clothes, actually try them on. It'll take a while but it's the only way to remember whether older clothes are worth keeping. Yes, you might have loved that shirt from five years ago, but if it doesn't fit and doesn't have extreme sentimental value, there's no reason to keep it anymore. Even if it does fit you, consider whether you've worn it in the last year. If not and if you're not about to wear it tomorrow, find it a new home through donation, and let someone else love it from here on out.  In simpler terms: put everything away when you're not using it. If every bit of clothing or other personal item has a 'home', staying organized is easy. It's a lot of work to set up, but once you know which drawer houses your socks, which part of the closet is for shirts, and where your trousers go, it's easy to stick to it.  Once of the biggest sources of mess in people's rooms is dirty clothes. Get a big hamper or basket for dirty clothes, and every time you take something off that you don't plan on wearing again before you wash it, throw it right in there, rather than on the floor. Once the hamper is full (or even before), do a load of laundry. When the laundry is done, put the clothes away right away. Skipping the steps where dirty clothes clutter up the floor or clean clothes are sitting around waiting to be put away will help everything feel much more organized.  Some people love having a lot of sentimental mementos in their rooms. It's not exactly minimalist, but it's okay, as long as you keep them somewhat tidy and clean. Clean them every now and then so that they don't accumulate a lot of fluff and dust, and they'll only enhance your room.  Ok, everyone accumulates a fair share of junk that doesn't 'fit' with other supplies. Designate one drawer or box/shelf in your closet for these items that don't 'go' with anything else. Every few months, look through it and throw out what you don't need. Junk has a way of accumulating!  ","sort out your clutter. use your drawers, wardrobes, and built-in closets religiously. do laundry regularly. organize your trinkets and ornaments. consider having a 'junk' drawer or box. "
"Chair pose is similar to a squat, and can help tone your thigh muscles as well as giving you some stamina. Because much of yoga centers around breathing, stand and breathe deeply, taking a few seconds to connect with your breath before you start.Press your feet together and push your hips back as though you are sitting in a chair. Lower yourself as far as you comfortably can, ideally until your thighs are parallel with the floor. Your shins should be perpendicular to the floor with your knees directly over your ankles, not pushed out over your toes.  Extend your arms straight overhead and hold the position for 20 to 30 seconds, breathing deeply. You can also press your palms together in front of your chest.  Lunges and leg lifts are basic lower body exercises that have a place in any workout routine designed to build lower body strength. These exercises can be done slowly, as static exercises, or quickly as a lower-impact interval.If you're doing lunges or leg lifts as part of a routine with plyometric exercises, you may want to do them more slowly and use them as a lower-intensity rest period following a high-intensity plyometric exercise such as sumo squat jumps.  Lunges also can be used as an effective warm-up interval before you do an interval of sumo squat jumps.  Calf raises are a very simple exercise that you can do at home. All you need is a box, set of stairs, or other elevated surface. Begin the exercise by standing with the balls of your feet on the elevated surface and your heels over the edge.Keeping your back straight and your shoulders rolled back, push with the ball of your foot to lift your body onto your toes, lifting your heels as high as you can.  As you lower, make sure your body is straight as you lower your heels as low as you can. Repeat for a 30-second interval.  Make sure you're not rocking your body or pulsing as you raise or lower your heels. The movement should be smooth and controlled. If you need help keeping your body straight, hold onto a rail or the back of a chair for balance.  Box jumps are a basic plyometric exercise you'll find in almost any plyometric exercise routine. The size or height of the box isn't important, as long as you can jump onto it from the ground.The point of box jumps is not speed, but power. Stand a few feet away from the box with your feet in a wide stance, a little more than shoulder-width apart. Lower into a semi-squat, then immediately propel your body up and forward onto the box. Step back down and repeat. Don't jump off the box – step carefully down.  You also can do lateral jumps, where you're standing to the side of the box and jumping to the side.  Focus on landing softly on the top of the box. This can take some practice, but you want to control your movement so the jump has as little thudding impact as possible.  Close out your workout with a stretching routine that will loosen up and relax your muscles. Always stretch at the end of your workout, not the beginning.A comprehensive stretching routine can help reduce your risk of injuries and also lower the amount of recovery time your body needs.  Focus on stretching the muscles you've worked during your routine. Do static stretches, in which you move your muscle until you feel a stretch and then hold the stretch for 20 or 30 seconds.  For example, if you've done sumo squat jumps you might want to stretch your quads. Stand and bend one knee to bring your foot behind your buttocks. Grab your foot with your hand and press on the top of your foot until you feel a stretch in your quad. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds, then release and do the other leg.  ","add some yoga with chair pose. include lunges and leg lifts. build strong calves with calf raises. get explosive power with box jumps. improve flexibility with a stretching routine. "
"Scientists understand the Celsius scale as derived from the Kelvin scale.Though the gaps between Celsius and Kelvin are even larger than the gaps between Celsius and Fahrenheit, one thing that Celsius and Kelvin have in common is that they rise at the same rate. Whereas the ratio for Celsius to Fahrenheit is 1:1.8, the ratio for Celsius to Kelvin is 1:1.If it seems odd that freezing for Kelvin would be such a high number--273.15--it's because the Kelvin scale is based around absolute zero, which is 0°K.  Though 0°C is the freezing temperature of water, scientists actually understand 0°C as 273.15°K.Since the two scales rise at the same rate, then converting Celsius to Kelvin always means simply adding 273.15.  For example, if you're working with the temperature 30°C, just add 273.15 to that. 30 + 273.15 = 303.15°K.  Here's a rough scale so you can test whether your answer makes sense. Note that the Celsius and Kelvin scales increase at the same rate, so the two numbers are always exactly 273.15 apart.  If you start with an integer value of degrees Celsius, your result in kelvins will end in the decimal .15.  The lowest possible temperature is -273.15ºC = 0 kelvins. If your result involves negative kelvins, you either made a math mistake or the problem uses impossible values.  ","understand the scales. add 273.15 to your celsius temperature. check your answer. "
"Remember to dig based on the excavation area that you received permission to dig in. If you dig outside of that you risk digging into something like a sewer line or a fiber optic cable. Also know what kind of soil you'll be excavating. If you're digging into bedrock you won't get very far.  You also should check your soil records at the town office before you start digging to see what you are going to be digging into and what kind of equipment you will need. Ask the clerk at the town office about your property and they will have the records available for you to see most of the time. If they don't, you might have to have someone come and survey your land.  It’s incredibly important to know what kind of soil you are working with, and this will also inform your digging strategy. Have a professional come and survey your soil.  Cut and cover works if you are digging in relatively soft soil. The idea is that you dig out an area, build a concrete structure inside of it, and then cover the hole thing up with dirt again. Obviously you want to keep your hatch or staircase exposed so that you can enter into your structure. However, if your soil will allow for it this is a good way to build a large framework for your home. , This is especially important if you plan to create a berm house. A berm house is a house that is covered by soil but still has windows and doorways to the outside. Your house will sit in a deep foundation and once you have completed the construction of the building you can push the dirt up the sides and on top of the house to create the berm look. This will require a reinforced roof.  ","develop a strategy to dig your hole. investigate the conditions of your soil. consider a cut and cover strategy. save the excess soil. "
"While it is possible to boil any potato you happen to have, some potatoes are better boiled than others (namely, the waxy ones), while some potatoes (namely, the floury ones) are not ideal for boiling and will often turn to mush. Knowing which potato to choose makes all the difference:  Choose waxy potatoes for boiling. Waxy potatoes have a high water content and a low starch content. This helps the potatoes to keep their shape. This is particularly useful if you're making potato salad.  Choose new potatoes (also known as chats) for boiling. New potatoes are lovely boiled, and they don't need to be cooked for too long.  Good potato choices for boiling: Bintje, Desirée (fair), Kennebec, Kipfler, chats (new potatoes), Nicola, Patrones, Pink Eye, (Red) Pontiac, Pink Fir Apple, Sebago (good rather than excellent), Sequoia etc.;  ,  ","select a good boiling potato. always boil similar sized potatoes together to ensure even cooking.

"Clay natural chemical concentrations vary, as: Sodium-/Na-bentonite; Potassium-/K-bentonite and Aluminum-/Al-bentonite and even Calcium-/Ca-bentonite (sold as one of several kind of fuller's earth).Caution: Some 'bentonite clay' does not say what its constituents may be. So, grabbing your spoon is not highly recommended. Some bentonite clay is called Montmorillonite -- a very soft phyllosilicate group of minerals that typically form in microscopic crystals, that form a clay. Montmorillonite is the main constituent of the volcanic ash weathering product, bentonite.Caution: Other kinds of fuller's earth may, also, be palygorskite or attapulgite -- a magnesium aluminium phyllosilicate which occurs in types of clay soil common to the Southeastern United States.Used in medicine, it physically binds to acids and toxic substances in the stomach and digestive tract. It has often been used in antidiarrheal medications, until 2003, it was the active ingredient used in Kaopectate(TM), before that product was reformulated with bismuth subsalicylate.

Repeat every 3-4 hours.Usually there will be great improvement in how one feels in about 24 hours.  ","talk to your doctor before taking any bentonite (there are many natural clays). purchase a good quality bentonite, either in liquid suspension form (usually packaged in glass bottles), or in powder form. , suggested use -- laxative: so, at the first sign of colds or fluor infections, put 2 tablespoons of liquid bentonite into a glass, add 2 oz.

"Ask the average person what a 'smooth guy' is like and you'll probably get an answer along the lines of, 'He's impeccably handsome, cool, confident, and well-dressed, with tons of masculine hobbies and interests.' While the first four items in this list can certainly be a big help in the dating game, the last is hardly the end-all-be-all it's often made out to be. Don't feel a need to conceal or lie about the things you like to do. If you're geeky, be unabashedly geeky. If you like to do something really bizarre, like watch syrupy French romance films from the silent film era, don't hide this fact — it's super cool to like something unique! Being 100% honest about how you like to spend your time makes you seem genuine and confident and distinguishes you from everyone else around you.  Clubs, singles bars, and other traditional dating 'hot spots' are great for people who are in their element when the music's blaring loud and everyone around them is drunk. For everyone else, it may be much easier to meet people elsewhere. For starters, try meeting women at places and events that you naturally enjoy attending. For instance, if you like exercise and the outdoors, you might want to try running in a popular park. By using this approach, you're more likely to meet women that you have things in common with than you would be simply visiting a local club.  We've all heard it before: 'Be yourself and you'll go far.' This age-old advice is a little cheesy, but when it comes to smooth operators, it's completely true. Smooth guys don't follow others when it comes to defining themselves — they do what they want to do and present themselves how they want to be presented and let others judge them as they see fit. Having your own unique personal style makes you hugely more interesting and memorable than trying to be someone else's idea of 'cool', so being yourself isn't only easier than being trendy, it's also smarter if you're trying to win people over.  One way to immediately and visibly differentiate yourself from other people is to dress in a way that's not 100% ordinary (while obviously not completely absurd either). For instance, you might want to try buying your clothes at a second-hand store or a vintage shop for a worn-in, retro look or even making your own clothes and accessories by knitting or sewing them yourself.  When it comes to pursuing women, honesty is the best policy. For the most part, everyone (ladies included) can tell a phony from a genuine person, so trying to act like someone you're not or conceal your true feelings will just lead to mutual feelings of awkwardness. Besides this, most women think sincerity is cute,so you have almost no reason not to be completely honest and open about your thoughts, opinions, and intentions. The absolute worst-case scenario that can occur from being honest is that you lose the opportunity to date someone, but if you would have had to lie about the way you feel to date this person, would you ever have been completely happy with them? Probably not.  For instance, if you've got certain 'dealbreakers' — things that you simply can't tolerate in your significant other, you'll definitely want to be open and honest about these with your partner (or potential partner). Think about it: would you rather spend a few weeks pretending to be into someone who smokes, belches, and listens to Limp Bizkit all day, or would you rather politely nip this relationship in the bud?  Note that, however, there is such a thing as over-sharing. While you'll want to be sincere about your thoughts and feelings, you probably won't want to make things awkward by bringing up intensely personal information before you truly get to know someone.  You can't love other people if you don't love yourself, so if you have a lousy opinion of yourself, steer clear of romance until you do. Ideally, romantic relationships should be the cherry on top of a happy, satisfied life — experiences that are truly wonderful to have, but not things that you need to be happy. Smooth men are always at ease partly because they know that, no matter what happens in their romantic life, they'll be more or less happy regardless. To have a happy foundation for the possibility of future relationships, below are just a few of the things you will probably want your life to contain:  A reasonable amount of personal independence (like, for instance, being able to support yourself and spend your free time as you please).  The opportunity (and motivation) to pursue hobbies and interests.  Stable, satisfying non-romantic friendships.  A satisfying level of professional and/or personal achievement (like performing well at your job, becoming an important member of your community, etc.)  ","don't be ashamed of your interests. look for women where you naturally hang out. have your own style. be open and sincere. love thyself before loving others. "
"If you are able to, take a short mental break and focus on something else to help you remain calm. You may need to check out mentally for a few minutes, call up a friend and talk for a while, or distract yourself with something in your environment.For example, if your boss says something infuriating in a department meeting, and you don’t want to confront them, you could start thinking about what you want to make for dinner that night. You could start preparing a mental grocery list.  As long as you’re not being rude (for example, if you’re in a one-on-one conversation) you could pull out your phone and play a game on it for a few minutes to remain calm. This might work if you are waiting for a delayed flight or in the waiting room to see your doctor.  Step back from how you are feeling in the moment and focus on something about the situation that may make you laugh. Sometimes the things we get angry about can be pretty ridiculous!For example, if you are arguing with someone whose appearance always reminds you of a donkey, you could imagine yourself arguing with an actual donkey.  Sometimes you might find yourself arguing that, upon reflection, is really silly. It can be helpful to diffuse the situation by calling it to the other person’s attention as well. For example, “Why are we arguing about what the baby is wearing? She is going to spit up on it in an hour anyway!”  , Do you find yourself getting angry at the same things, or around the same time each day? Think about what you can do to alter your behavior the next time you bump into this scenario, or how you can avoid it entirely in the first place.For example, getting everyone out the door in the morning to work and school can be a huge hassle. You may always be running late, or your kids consistently oversleep, and you start your day off stressed out. You may often find yourself losing your temper.  Find ways you can avoid the triggering situations, or reduce the likelihood that the situations will make you angry. Using the example of the rushed morning, you could wake up earlier, put alarm clocks in your kids’ rooms, or shower the night before.  When you find yourself getting angry by the usual situation, you could think to yourself, “I am always getting mad at this time of day. I am always going to feel stressed out when this happens. It will be over in a few minutes, I don’t need to get angry.” You can also try using some relaxation techniques like deep breathing and meditation to prepare yourself.  If you feel yourself getting irritable, fidgety, anxious, sweaty, or whatever physical symptoms you normally have when angry, try to find a way to take remove yourself from the situation before you get even angrier. Learn the physical cues you feel when you start getting upset.For example, you always feel your heart pounding and a tightness in your chest when you get angry. Pay attention to your body and know you need to take steps to stay calm if you begin to feel that way.  Try to excuse yourself for a few minutes to regroup. You could go to the bathroom or step outside for a second to collect yourself.  If you are not able to step away from the situation, but are feeling yourself angering, you could try a quick relaxation technique or taking some deep breaths.  Most likely, you try your best most of the time, and do your best to generally treat other people with kindness and courtesy. Understand that most people are just like you, doing their best and trying not to step on anyone else’s toes. So when you find yourself getting angry, stop and think about how, most likely, this person is just trying to get through their day, the same as you are, and likely doesn’t mean to cause you trouble.For example, you could tell yourself, “Jamie is just a child, that’s why he keeps asking you the same question,” or “Mary likes to chat with everyone, that’s why she’s coming over again while you’re working.” You might also remind yourself of times when you have lost your temper to have some compassion for other people who are going through the same thing.  This is an especially good thing to keep in mind when you are dealing with low-level customer service representatives who have little power in their ability to change policies. If you are frustrated with the level of service you are receiving, you could say, “I understand that you probably do not have the power to change this policy. I am not angry at you, but at the situation. Can you please direct me to someone who can better help me manage this problem?”  , Correct your thought patterns and avoid using “always” or “never” when describing a person or situation to yourself. These words will make you feel more quick to anger because you will feel like your anger is justified.Telling someone “You always do this” or “You never do that” will also put them on the defensive and escalate an argument and anger.  Instead of saying (to yourself or to another person) “You never throw your dirty laundry in the hamper!” you could say, “I had to pick up Bill’s socks again. It makes me mad when he does this.”  ","distract yourself. find humor in the situation. look at patterns. pay attention to how you are feeling. give people the benefit of the doubt. avoid thinking in extremes.

"When you first spawn, in the room with double points in the cell and the M14 on the wall, there should be a room next to it with an Olympia.

"Check whether or not your travel insurance covers your photography equipment. If not, seek additional insurance. It's never possible to know whether or not your equipment is safe – it might be stolen, lost, or broken at any part of your journey. Knowing that you're properly covered in the event of any of these things happening will ease the pain of losing your equipment a little. More importantly, knowing you've got insurance can also stop you from reacting in a foolhardy fashion and trying to defend your equipment if you're mugged.  Type up a list of every photography item you're taking with you. Keep a copy in your email draft folder or in cloud storage, a printed copy with someone trusted back home and several printed copies on you in different places, such as your handbag and suitcase. These lists will help you to identify stolen or lost property quickly.;  , Carrying a camera can sometimes raise a suspicion that you're a photo journalist or someone trying to document suspicious activities, and that can cause paranoid guards or police to be wary of you.  Make sure that your passport is up-to-date with at least 6 months on it before expiry.  Get all necessary visas prior to travel.  Have all of your vaccinations before leaving, and be sure to include proofs in your papers.  In some countries, you might not be able to just 'pick up' things you forgot to bring, or there may be issues of compatibility or affordability involved. On the other hand, you don't want to overload yourself with non-essential gear. Plan in advance to be sure that you have each piece of photography equipment that you know you'll actually need, as well as any suitable spares but no more. Some suggestions to consider include:  Carry all suitable plug-ins and converters for the destinations you're headed for. If you're going to be in multiple countries, check online what you might need.  Carry a small, portable and durable external hard drive. Some countries may not allow you to carry your computer with you and you will want a place to store your photographs safely. (Try to find out this information in advance.)  Take the right type of camera for the type of trip you're taking. If you'll be snorkeling or diving, use a camera able to withstand being in water; same for wet jungle expeditions. If you're going somewhere very hot or cold, take the climatic conditions into account when deciding on the camera type. Remember that batteries won't work well, if at all, in many extreme weather temperatures, so you might need work-arounds.  Be sure to pack your photography equipment correctly to avoid damage. This isn't only for during transportation but also when you're carrying it. Use straps if provided, especially if you scare easily or get excited; it can be easy to drop a camera in a moment of excitement at getting 'just the right shot'!  Invest in a travel tripod if you don't want to carry a larger one. These are very compact and can improve the quality of your shots considerably more than having nothing to lean on.  Traveling with photography equipment can set you apart as someone worth robbing, begging from, or bothering. The following safety ideas are aimed at reducing the chances of this happening:  Avoid carrying your equipment in well-known, labeled photography bags. Thieves grow to know the sign of these very quickly and can target you easily. Instead, try to ease your camera into an ordinary bag, even if still encased in its proper bag. Modern plastic cameras with modest-sized lenses can take somewhat rough use and don't always need a special bag; keep a clear filter over the lens to avoid scratching it. For more stuff a diaper bag (for women) or a gym-type bag (for men) could be helpful; don't use a bag that could inadvertently be thrown away. This is more of a problem where there are lots of people and in countries, cities, or areas with low trust issues. A cooler is a very strong, inconspicuous hard case (some padding inside is appropriate) and protects its contents against impact and external heat for several hours, such as might be present each day in a car trunk. A latch would help prevent inadvertent dumping of contents.  Travel with someone or as a group. When there is someone else with you, they can keep an eye out for you while you're busy lost in taking photos. They can also act as a deterrent to thieves or muggers when it's obvious that you're part of a pair or group.  Stay alert. Even though part of the fun of photography is to lose yourself in seeing the beauty or the unusual around you, a traveling photographer needs to be alert on two levels – the first level is about staying alert for your safety, the second level being looking for the ideal shot. Only after you're reassured that you're safe should you take your photos.  If you want to scout a place before taking photos, consider leaving the photography equipment back at the hotel safe while you do your check. That way, you can ponder and muse without having to be quite so alert to the possibility of your equipment being targeted.  Look the part. Always act like you know what you're doing and where you're headed, even if you don't. Being confident is a huge part of being left alone by people looking for easy prey.  If you have any suspicion at all that you're being followed, immediately seek help. Stop in a shop, latch onto a group of people, go into a restaurant, etc. Do whatever it takes to put the person off. Once you are located somewhere safer, call the police or friends to come and help you. Don't even think about taking out your photography gear!  Don't risk your life and limbs. Is that crazy shot really worth dangling over the edge of the cliff or clambering out on a tightrope wire? Be a sound judge of your physical limitations and don't push them. Remember, you're holding equipment that you don't want to drop, and if something does go wrong, the momentary confusion between saving yourself or your equipment could be enough to lose both of you. Just don't risk it.  Knowledge of local laws and customs can ensure that you don't put your foot in it.  Some cultures detest or fear being photographed because they fear that the camera 'steals their soul' (sympathetic magic or native cultural belief).Respect their beliefs even if you find it foreign or backward to your way of thinking. Other people are suffering from 'tourist burnout'; they're frankly sick of people taking their photos every which way and find it invasive or even offensive. Always cease photographing any person who objects – that's plain good manners. Read up on every culture you'll encounter and want to photograph; that way you'll be able to avoid distressing anybody.  Avoid treating individual people as if they're part of the backdrop or landscape. If you feel uncomfortable or arrogant in taking photos, listen to your feelings.Ask people if you can take a photograph of them individually or at work, play, etc. Consider how you would feel if somebody took photos of you without asking for permission as you're trying to run your market stall, or get on with your daily business. Not everybody appreciates the limelight but some people will be incredibly honored and you might even strike up a fruitful conversation, so it's always worth asking first, as a bit of considerate socializing can oil the wheels, so to speak. Another method for asking for permission suggested by Darren Rowse is to gesture to the camera, smile, and mime taking their photos with a quizzical look.You'll usually get an answer to this in affirmative because you bothered, but if it's a no, respect that.  Be especially considerate when photographing children as the close-up subjects of your photo. It'd probably freak you out if someone drove up and took photos of your kids playing on the front lawn. Keep this in mind when taking shots of kids at play in their homes, and remember that for some cultures, the fear of soul-stealing is greater in relation to children, who are viewed as more fragile.You don't want angry parents tearing after you; seek to establish a relationship first before taking photographic liberties.  Sometimes it pays to pay. Not everyone agrees with this but think about it: You've got the money, they've got the smile. Is this a case of standing on your principles, or of throwing a bit of your easy-earned cash to people living hard? Think it through carefully. Not doing so might lead to conflict if there's a general understanding in place that tourists cough up for photos. If you don't like making a payment, carry small gifts from your home country to appease people with, as suggested by Darren Rowse.Know the politics of a country before photographing anything that can be construed as politically sensitive. If you're in France and the students revolt, you're probably fine to take photos but if you're in a repressive country and you try the same, you might find yourself being rounded up by suspicious police. Use your common sense at all times.  Always obey signs that ask you not to take photographs. They mean it. Religious establishments want you to respect their faith; law enforcement and government agencies want you to respect their government's idea of privacy and secrecy, from airports to nuclear facilities; commercial entities worry about their copyrights, trademarks, and confidentiality being breached; and places that have animals worry about the animals being disturbed, scared, or harmed by photography. There is usually a genuine reason behind these requests and there will usually be an equally swift response to you seeking to break their requests or laws. When you break an actual law, you risk having your camera equipment being removed from you and perhaps even being arrested. See 'Tips' for examples of the types of places and occasions to be careful about when photographing.  Knowing some basic words goes a long way to being a polite photographer and will increase your chances of people agreeing to being photographed, or letting their home or artworks, etc., be photographed.  Carry a phrasebook with you at all times. One that fits in your camera bag is a good idea.  Try to learn the basic words for the area of photography that interests you most. For example, if you love photographing craft created by native peoples, learn the words for the craft items, such as baskets, clay pots, woven blankets, etc. If you love nature, learn the words for native trees and animals, etc.  Always learn please, thank you, 'you're welcome', 'please help me', and 'you're beautiful'.  Do your best to try to offload your photo collection as you travel, so that if something does go wrong, you don't lose the entire collection. Some ideas include:  Mail home memory cards regularly. Try to use registered mail for this and pad really well. Send it to a family member or friend rather than your lonely mailbox back home.  Download your photos onto a computer or other storage system if you're carrying such.  Upload photos to cloud storage. This can be paid or free, although paid storage at this stage will likely be greater than free. If you really can't afford to maintain one paid account, open different accounts with different cloud storage sites to cover your needs. You'll need to have good records of where you've left them though, along with passwords and any decoy email accounts you've set up for this purpose. Keep in mind that photo exchange online can chew up your broadband allowance in some places and you may be asked to pay more.  Wandering into strife-torn countries with a camera can be asking for trouble, especially if you're mistaken for a journalist.  ","get insurance coverage for your photography equipment. have everything in order with your papers. take the right photography gear with you. travel safe. learn and respect the local laws and social customs. learn the basics of the language where you're traveling. do regular photo back-ups. check travel advisories from your own country before venturing into countries in strife or with domestic problems.

"Before you can start a radon testing business, you'll need to know much more about its practice. This information can be found by researching radon online or by viewing the EPA's introductory guide at https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-05/documents/hmbuygud.pdf. Links to more articles and additional sources can be found at https://www.epa.gov/radon. Focus on learning important facts, such as:  According to the EPA, all homes and schools below the third floor are at risk for high levels of radon.  Buildings in certain areas of the country are more susceptible to high levels of radon.  EPA guidelines state that any result over 4.0 pCi/L (picocuries per liter) represents an unsafe level of radon.;  , There are 2 types of radon testing kits: short-term and long-term testing kits. Short-term kits test the radon levels in a home for a period of time between 2 and 90 days, depending on the type of kits. Long-term kits stay in a home for over 90 days and offer a more accurate reading of the year-round radon levels in a home.  All radon kits should be placed on the lowest lived-in area of a home or building. Place them at least 20 inches (50 cm) off the floor and away from exterior walls, drafts, and high humidity or heat.There are many different types of radon test kits, each with different specific benefits and drawbacks. Read through the different types at http://www.nrsb.org/devices.asp.  Some states regulate radon professionals independently or EPA guidelines. These states may require those who measure or those mitigate radon levels, or both, to obtain and maintain a license to do so. Others may simply require them to register. In any case, you'll need to check with the appropriate regulatory body in your state to find out what its requirements are.State requirements can be found by visiting https://certi.us/cms/radon-training/state-radon-training-requirements and selecting your state.  Even if your state does not require you to be licensed, you should still seek professional certification to gain credibility with your customers. The National Environmental Health Association (NEHA) certifies radon professionals as part of the National Radon Proficiency Program (NRPP). Certified radon testers and mitigators are also listed on the NRPP's website, making you more visible to potential customers.To become certified, you will need to take a qualifying education course and then pass a certification exam. At this point you can apply for NRPP certification.  There are two different measurement (testing) certifications: standard services and standard and analysis services. The second includes a device performance test and the ability to analyze radon test results yourself rather than sending your device to a lab.  Certification courses can be found at http://aarst-nrpp.com/wp/entry-level-courses/. There are options that take place in actual classrooms and some that are done entirely online. Anyone looking to start a radon testing business should take and pass one of the radon measurement courses. The exam will be offered at the end of the in-class course or can be signed up for at http://www.psiexams.com/.  Courses are 16 hours in total and cover everything from the science behind radon creation to choosing a test device and analyzing results.  Exams are typically 100 multiple choice questions, which you will have 2 hours to complete.  Exam fees are $110.00.Certifications last for two years, after which point they can be renewed with the appropriate continuing education., Research whether there's a need for a radon testing business in your area. Check online and in the phone book for similar, existing businesses. If there already are a number of established radon testing businesses, expand your potential customer base to another area. Or, if you can, identify an underserved market for radon testing.  For example, there are a variety of potential customers of a radon testing business, from landlords and homeowners to large business and local governments.  Try talking to realtors to assess the market for residential testing in your area. Forming relationships with them may also later prove useful, as they can provide you with referrals., Before you can start your business, you will need a plan for operating it. This includes addresses how much it will cost to get started. Expenses to consider include the costs of your start up, testing kits, transportation, marketing, and taxes. Describe how you will find customers, what testing options you will offer, and what your projected income is for the first 2 years.

It is possible to run this type of business from home, so that should be your first option is costs are an issue.  Include a description of the planned structure for your business. Most radon testing businesses are sole proprietorships, but you may want to consider other structures, like an LLC or partnership., Search for professional radon testing kits by searching for suppliers online. Make sure to check the reputation of each supplier by reading consumer reviews and asking for references. Also inquire how long it takes to deliver each order of radon tests, and how much they cost. Make sure you're getting professional radon testing kits instead of consumer ones. Otherwise, customers will have no reason to hire you.  The Radon Testing Corporation of America, PRO-LAB, and AccuStar are all reputable providers of testing equipments.  See the NRPP's full list of approved devices by visiting their website at http://aarst-nrpp.com/wp/approved-devices/.  You won't need much money to get started, but you will have to raise that money somehow if you don't already have it. Your options for doing so include taking out a small business loan, obtaining a personal loan from a friend or family member, or selling your own assets. If you choose to get a loan, seek a business loan guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA), as this may be easier for the average borrower to qualify for.Your startup costs will include the following:  Testing kits and a method to have them analyzed. Many kits include free lab testing. The cost of these will vary based on what type of kits you choose and how many you buy to start.  Certification fees if you have not already been certified.  Transportation expenses.  Funds for advertising. This amount can vary widely and depends on how actively you plan to advertise.  Insurance. Radon measurement professionals will need errors and omissions or general liability insurance to protect them from legal action. Specific radon professional insurance plans are available through the North American Professional Liability Insurance Agency (NAPLIA)., Check with your city or county office to see what specific license requirements you have to meet. In most cases, you will need to register a 'doing business as' (DBA) name. This name distinguishes your business from you and must be unique (not already taken by another business). Contact the relevant local office to register your DBA name., Place your order for your radon testing supplies based on how many homes or businesses you think you'll service during your initial operations. You can always buy more later if you need them. Most sites will have the supplies listed by how many locations they can test.  Divide the price of the testing supplies by the number of tests they offer to arrive at a test per measurement cost. You can shop around to reduce this cost and, in doing so, increase your profit margin., Print business cards, flyers, and price lists to give to potential customers. Also promote your business on the Internet by means of a website and social networks. Consider purchasing radio or newspaper advertisements if you have the money for it. You can also engage in free marketing by networking with local contractors, inspectors, real estate agents, and builders who might have use of your radon testing services.  Your radon testing education should have given you the tools you need to explain radon risks to customers. Use this information as part of your marketing strategy to explain to them why they need to have their home tested and the risks of not doing so., Once your business is running, you may have certain customers with unsafe levels of radon in their home or business. In this situation, you will want to know of a reputable radon mitigation business to which you can recommend your customers. You can even negotiate a 'finder's fee' where you get a portion of the mitigator's earnings from customers you send their way. Search for radon mitigation specialists in your area by visiting the NRPP's website.  You can also offer to do the post-mitigation testing required to make sure the mitigation efforts have been effective.

"Add 2 inches of water into the steamer pot and set the steamer basket over the pot.;  , Let the water heat up while you start preparing your beetroot. You may want to put on gloves at this point, to keep your hands from staining.  Wash and scrub them. Using a sharp knife, slice off the stems and the tails of your beetroot. Discard the ends before cutting the beetroot into quarters.  You'll want to leave the skins on to keep the color. It will also be easier to remove the skin after you've steamed the beetroot., The water should be boiling. Place the lid over the steamer basket. No steam should escape.  If you have large beetroot, consider cutting the quarters even smaller so they cook evenly and faster. Try 1/2 inch slices., Remove the lid and poke the beetroot with a fork or knife. The beetroot should be tender enough that the utensil easily slides in and out. If it is hard to poke or gets stuck, the beetroot needs to steam longer.

"This method of folding perfect thirds uses nothing more than the measuring power of the human eye to find the spots where your paper folds into thirds. Despite this, it's surprisingly effective. In fact, once you've practiced it a few times, you can probably get away with using it for important correspondence.  To begin, you want to take one edge of the paper and double it up, bringing it across the top of the rest of the page. Don't make any creases yet — the edge you are about to fold should be gently rounded.  Try to line up the edge of the paper that you're holding so that it covers half of the paper that remains. The human eye is much better at judging halves than thirds, so it will be much easier to line up the paper correctly here than it would have been if you had attempted fold the paper into thirds from the beginning.  When you have the edge of the page lined up just right, crease the paper, making sure not to let the free edge move as you're making your crease.  The hard part of this method is already done. Now, all that you need to do is make the final one-third fold. Do this by taking the other edge of the paper and tucking it under the top edge so that it is snug against the inside of the crease. Make a second crease.  If you've made accurate folds, all of the edges of your paper should line up at this point. If they don't, feel free to make minor adjustments as needed.  ","fold one edge of the paper over the top of the sheet. line the edge up so that it covers half of the space. tuck the remaining edge into the crease and fold in half. "

"Figure out what being interesting means to you. What’s interesting won’t be the same to everybody and for everybody. Knowing what you are interested in is essential to becoming more adept at interacting with others in a way that might be seen as more interesting. Hone your skills by learning about what you are good at. This is a much easier approach instead of trying to force yourself to learn more about something that you don’t have any interest in.Think about qualities and activities that are fascinating to you. What do you think is interesting, either about yourself or about other people?  It is also much easier to converse about topics that you already have some interest in, as opposed to simply acting interested in others’ lives simply to make them happy.;  , Determining what is “interesting” – and how you can attain this quality – will probably depend on your own unique skill set as well as the group of people you enjoy being around the most. If you consider yourself a pretty good musician, for example, and enjoy hanging around musically inclined people, then being interesting will likely involve a working knowledge of music and how to play an instrument. On the other hand, such elements might not be so important to being an interesting person if you are someone who’s primarily interested in sports or cars.  This doesn’t mean that you should completely tailor your conversations for other people. If you’re not interested in what you’re saying, then you’re not going to be as interesting. Strive to be genuine while being interesting.  Recognize that you are already an interesting person. You may become a more interesting person for other people when you highlight some of your unique qualities.  This might sound paradoxical at first, but it really just means that striving to be yourself is the best way to appear most comfortable. This in turn will make others more comfortable around you.  Experiment with new activities that might interest you. When you stretch your comfort zone, you get yourself out of a rut. You inject more excitement in your life. You meet new people. Be open to trying new activities so that you learn to be a little more fearless.Try volunteering at a nonprofit organization, or learning a new sport or hobby. Pick something that you have very little experience with and go for it!  , Your goal to become more interesting might involve becoming more courageous or being friendlier. But it's difficult to achieve these traits unless you have a specific plan in place. Try out concrete activities or skills, instead of focusing on building one of your personality traits.  For example, instead of convincing yourself you need to be more courageous, you might try simply participating in an activity that produces some degree of fear when you think about it. Or, you could try rock climbing if you are afraid of heights, or visit a petting zoo if you are afraid of animals. By pushing yourself out of your comfort zone, you might eventually become more comfortable with participating in activities you or others might find interesting.  When you expand your network of acquaintances, you can become exposed to more interesting situations and activities. Ask people questions about themselves.  Once you get someone talking, you may discover, for example, that this person has expert knowledge of beekeeping, an activity you've always wanted to try.  Seeing more of the world can make you more attuned to subtle differences between people from different backgrounds or different ethnicities. Being sensitive to how these differences affect others and yourself can sometimes make people feel more comfortable around you.  This will also give you a greater sense for what interesting can look like in different parts of the world.  Make your next holiday an unusual one. Go to an exotic place and do things you would not normally do. This might include an activity such as backpacking, surfing, climbing a mountain or going on a jungle safari.  Read books about fun topics such as how to make unique cocktails, exotic places to travel or how to become a great lover. These topics will give you lots of material for riveting conversations.  It’s important to learn how to engage with others even when you’re not interested in the topic that’s being discussed. Conversation is like a back and forth negotiation with another person. The conversation can go in any direction. Remaining open to this process is important for becoming a more interesting person. Ask questions to show that you are interested. This also opens up the conversation to give you more material, which helps you figure out more questions to ask.  For example, if you find out that a person is an expert beekeeper, you could ask, 'I've always wanted to get into beekeeping. How does a person get started doing that?' You're allowing the other person to share his expertise with others, something most people are thrilled to do.  If you're talking with someone about her job, you might ask, 'Did you always want to be a journalist?' Or you might ask, 'Which journalist do you admire most?', Find people who have skills and interests that you admire. Prioritize the time you spend with them. Remember that who you spend time with greatly affects how your personality and interests develop.Spheres of social influence, from your local community to your country, can affect you in overt and subtle ways. Watching others who are interesting can be a great way to get you started in the right direction.  Research has found that even if you aren’t necessarily happy to begin with, the mere act of smiling can release chemicals in your brain that make you more comfortable in your surroundings. As a result, your smile conveys this feeling to others. Smiling and laughter has even been shown to relieve symptoms of minor depression and anxiety.If you want to be a more interesting person, therefore, but can’t seem to get started on the right path, simply smiling more often and putting yourself in situations that make you laugh can be a great place to start.  Everyone has their own interests and manners of acting in the world. It will be impossible to make yourself seem interesting to everyone. Be happy with who you truly are. Accept that not everyone will find you interesting, or even necessarily like you. This can in turn make you more interesting to the people who actually respect your unique sense of self.  Give this person the benefit of the doubt. Say to yourself, 'This person is probably having a bad day.' Then say something nice to the person. This might jar him enough to recognize that he's being rude.  You could try exaggerating the insult, which also functions to make a mockery of the insult. If someone says, 'I've seen lots of people learn to ski more quickly than you,' you might say, 'I've only just learned how to walk upright, so I guess I'm going at a good pace.', While being interesting can mean talking about yourself, it also means that you show interest in other people. Ask about the person’s children, or ask for details about his recent vacation. Make the other person comfortable in your presence by making yourself easy to talk to., Don’t let a conversation die out by failing to show adequate interest. Keep a conversation going by continuing to ask questions. This shows that you are listening and are invested in what the other person has to say.Ask open-ended questions in the conversation. These types of questions encourage the other person to talk at length, rather than give a yes-or-no answer to your question.  A person is interesting often because he is interesting to listen to. No matter the subject, he can tell a good story. He relates funny details, engages the audience, and stays focused on the topic at hand.  A great story that you're telling to someone else has certain elements just like books or movies. A great story has compelling characters, relevant details, a conflict, a turning point, and even a surprising ending.Even if the story is short, think about how you can structure the story to be fascinating to the listener.  Oftentimes, you can be an interesting person simply by allowing those around you to say what’s on their mind without interrupting or imposing any sort of moral judgment. While this might sound easy, it can actually be a particularly difficult thing. This is especially true if you’re used to saying exactly what’s on your mind without pause for concern. Active listening means that you are following along actively with what another person is saying without forcing your own ideas and thought into the conversation.Active listening also means that you remain attentive to what’s being conveyed without necessarily trying to think forward towards what you want to say next. Next time somebody is trying to tell you a story, try simply letting them speak for as long as they feel compelled to do so, all the while allowing yourself to be affected by what they are saying.  Watch for changes in facial expression or tone of voice. Good listening requires paying attention to non-verbal features just as much as what’s said.People typically like being around others who give them a chance to speak what’s on their mind.  Hold your body in a confident manner. Straighten your shoulders and hold your head high. You might even try being more expressive with your hands, instead of jamming them in your pockets.  When you are talking with someone, convey your full attention with confident body language. This means that your body faces him or her, and you make eye contact.If you are in a room with a lot of distractions, try your best to focus on this other person.  ","write down a list of your skills and interests. think about what “interesting” might mean to other people. embrace your uniqueness. try out new activities to stretch your comfort zone. build your personality traits by trying out concrete activities. meet new people. travel as much as possible. read more. learn to engage with others about their interests. hang out with people who you find interesting. smile and laugh as often as you can. learn to shake off insults or disrespect from other people. get a sense of what people want to hear about. ask questions. learn how to be a good storyteller. become an active listener. use confident body language.

"Burglars can sometimes remove or damage lock cylinders by hammering, wrenching, or prying. Protect these with metal guard plates or protective rings on both sides of the door. Install guard plates with round-head carriage bolts to prevent them from being unscrewed. Free-spinning rings around the cylinders will prevent the use of a pipe wrench to twist out the cylinder. Many locks come with these already, but if yours doesn't, you can purchase them.  The strike plate is the metal plate that surrounds the lock-set (the hole in the door frame where the lock bolt enters). All exterior doors should have heavy-duty metal security strike plates secured by four 3-inch screws. Many homes are built with lower quality strike plates or have strike plates that are secured with short screws that just attach to the door jamb, not the underlying stud.  Hinges should be on the inside of the door. If yours are not, rehang the door or secure the exposed hinges with non-removable pins. You can do this by removing at least the two center screws of the hinge (on each side) and replacing them with non-removable hinge pins (you can get these at the hardware store) or double-headed masonry nails. Even hinges that are not exposed should be secured to the frame with 3-inch screws.  Even if your door is strong and has high-quality, properly installed locks, a burglar may be able to gain entry by breaking or prying the door frame. Most door frame moldings are simply tacked to the wall, so a crowbar or a solid kick can easily separate the frame from the wall. Secure your door frames to the walls by installing several 3-inch screws along the frame and doorstop. The screws should reach the wall stud.  ","install cylinder guards around the lock cylinders (the part where you insert the key). replace flimsy strike plates. secure exposed hinges. fortify your frame. "
"Place the paper pattern down on the material and either pin or tape into place.  For wood, use a jigsaw, bandsaw or other suitable cutting tool to cut the shape out. If you're not good at doing this, ask someone who is to do it for you––it won't take them long to do this simple shape.  For cardboard, use paper-suitable scissors and simply cut around the pattern piece.  Cover the work surface, as glitter will go everywhere! The application of the glitter will depend on the type of glitter you're using and the surface you've used for the base.  It is recommended that you use large glitter, the glitter that looks more like confetti. The effect needs to be very obvious and bright.  For a wooden surface: Apply wood glue and shake the glitter over the top.  For a cardboard surface: Apply paper glue and shake the glitter over the top.  Spray a sealant or protective glue over the entire finished arrow. This will help keep the arrow' glittery surface intact and will allow the glitter to cope with light rain or dew. Spray several layers of sealant, allowing to dry between each spray (and follow the manufacturer's instructions for spraying it).  ","cut or saw the arrow shape out of the chosen material. add the glitter. apply a sealant or protective glue layer. "
"The majority of cases of obesity are caused by diet and lifestyle choices. You gain weight when you take in more calories than you burn through daily activities – either due to having a sedentary lifestyle, eating an unhealthy diet, or both.Your doctor can help you to overcome obesity by educating you about diet and lifestyle changes, helping you to make a meal plan or exercise regimen that’s right for you, and referring you to other helpful professionals. You and your doctor can work to overcome your obesity as a team.  It’s also important to see your doctor regularly to monitor for and treat other health conditions affected by obesity, such as diabetes, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure.  Ask your doctor if any medications you take may make it harder to lose weight. Some medicines like antidepressants, antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, steroids, and beta-blockers (a type of heart medicine) can cause weight gain.  Consult with your doctor before starting any big changes in your diet or exercise regimen. Discuss any health conditions you have, and any medications you take, so you can approach your goals safely and effectively.;  , Nutritionists and dietitians are professionals trained to help you eat healthy in the way that’s best for you. Work with one to create a meal plan, and to ensure you get all the vitamins and minerals you need while eating to lose weight.  Often, your doctor can refer you to a nutritionist or dietitian. Tell your doctor something like, “I’d like extra help creating a healthy diet. Can you suggest someone to help me?”  , Consider hiring a personal trainer if you have the means to do so. Personal trainers can teach you how to exercise properly and safely, and can be very motivational. They can teach you appropriate form for exercises and help you to develop a consistent plan with gradually increasing levels of difficulty.  If a personal trainer is out of your price range, try joining a class at the gym or YMCA. You won’t get as much individualized attention, but you’ll still have camaraderie and support from others.  Sometimes the best way to overcome obesity is to work with a care team. Depending on your needs and circumstances, your doctor may have you work with a mental health professional or an obesity specialist.Remember that obesity is a disorder that can be treated and conquered with the right help.  Weight-loss medications do not replace a healthy diet and exercise, but in some situations they can be a helpful addition. You may qualify for weight-loss medications if your BMI is over 30, or is over 27 but you have related health issues. These medications don’t work for everyone, and there’s a risk you will regain some of the weight when you stop the medications – but your doctor will help you know if a medication is right for you.Some common weight-loss medications include:  Orlistat (Xenical), phentermine and topiramate (Qsymia), lorcaserin (Belviq), liraglutide (Saxenda), and buproprion/naltrexone (Contrave).  Take all medications as directed by your doctor.  Weight-loss surgery, or bariatric surgery, limits how much food you can eat and/or how you digest and absorb food. You can have good results, but there are also risks. Surgeries can have consequences in how you absorb some vitamins and minerals that you need, so always continue to work with your healthcare provider after your surgery. There are several kinds of surgery to consider, and your doctor can help you choose one that’s right for you. You’re only eligible for surgery if you meet all of these criteria:You’ve unsuccessfully tried other methods to lose weight  You have a BMI of 40 or higher or 35-39.9 with other related health problems  You’re committed to also making diet and lifestyle changes during and after your use of medicine  , Rarely, obesity is caused by genetic or medical conditions. Discuss your health history and family history with your doctor to rule out any medical causes for your weight concerns. Talk to your doctor about getting tested if you have a family history of any of these conditions, or if you have other signs or symptoms of these conditions (though this is not a comprehensive list):Hypothyroidism (low thyroid function): some common symptoms include fatigue, feeling cold a lot, dry skin, weight gain, changes in your menstrual cycle, thin/fine hair, and depression.Cushing’s syndrome (too much cortisol in your body): symptoms include a fatty hump between your shoulder blades, changes in your menstrual cycle, a wide, round face, and purplish stretch marks.Prader-Willi syndrome: those born with this disorder feel hunger and a need to eat constantly., You and your doctor should discuss how many calories per day you should try to eat. The average goal is 1,200 to 1,500 calories per day for women, and 1,500 to 1,800 calories per day for men.Your goal is to burn more calories than you eat – that’s the only way to safely and effectively lose weight naturally.  It may help to keep a food journal. Record what you eat, how many calories you’re getting from your foods, and how many servings you’re eating. Remember that if the food label lists an item as 100 calories but you’re eating three times the serving size, that’s 300 calories.  When possible, try to eat five to six small, healthy meals a day instead of the conventional three larger meals a day. You may feel more satiated, and you’ll be less likely to overeat.If this doesn’t fit with your schedule, focus on limiting your portion sizes during meals. Use a smaller plate, and try to fill 2/3 of your plate with vegetables, fruits, or whole grains.  Limit calories without losing nutritional value by choosing the right foods to feel full while eating less.Some foods, like sweets and junk food, have high energy density, i.e. they contain a lot of calories in a small portion. You can eat larger servings of foods with lower energy density, like fruits and vegetables, and still limit your calories., Fresh fruits and vegetables are low in fat and calories, and contain lots of nutrients. Opt for fresh or frozen over canned – canned fruits and veggies can contain lots of salt and additives.Make the bulk of your meals with whole grains – choose whole wheat bread, rice, pasta, oats, and quinoa.  Avoid white bread and other refined sugars.  Eat a variety of vegetables – dark leafy greens, red and yellow veggies, peas and beans, and starches.Aim to eat 5-9 servings of fruits and vegetables daily.  Bad fats are saturated fats. These are found in red meat, butter, lard, shortening, and bacon. They are solid at room temperature, and they can raise your cholesterol in your blood. Limit these in your diet as much as possible.  Cook with olive oil instead of butter; olive oil contains good fats that are better for you.  Switch red meat like beef and pork with poultry and fish; fatty fish like salmon, mackerel, and herring are good healthy options.  Choose low-fat or fat-free dairy.  Get protein from unsalted nuts, seeds, soy, and beans.  Junk food like chips, cookies, soda, and other prepackaged items from the snack aisle contain lots of fat and sugar and quickly add to your calorie count. Limit these items in your diet as much as possible. Try to replace sugary, high-fat desserts with fresh fruit or popsicles; snack on vegetables, hummus, or nuts rather than salty snack foods.Limit eating takeout or fast food to once a week at most., Sugars add lots of calories to your daily diet, and can contribute to health problems like diabetes. Try not to eat many sweets, candies, or baked desserts. Avoid sugary drinks like soda, energy drinks, sweetened coffee and tea, and flavored water.Invigorate regular water with natural flavors like citrus slices, mint, or cucumber.  Alcohol contains a lot of sugar and extra calories. Other than the health effects of alcohol, consuming it regularly can make it more difficult to lose weight.Limit yourself to “moderate” alcohol intake – one glass a day for women, and two for men.  If you don’t drink alcohol, don’t start.  Any diet that promises immediate or drastic weight loss is probably either unhealthy, unrealistic, or both. Most fad or crash diets might help you lose weight quickly, but you’re almost guaranteed to put the weight back on – and in the mean time, you might be doing your body harm. The best way to lose weight is gradually and consistently to improve your health and keep the weight off., Even a 10 minute walk every day can improve your health.If you’ve been sedentary or overweight for a while, you may have to start slowly. Set small goals for yourself and build on them, such as, “I will take a 15 minute walk every day this week,” and, “I will increase my activity to 30 minutes, 5 days per week starting by the end of the month.” Once you start to consistently get exercise it will become a habit, making it easier to accomplish.  In order to lose weight when you’re obese, you need to partake in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise each week. Try to create a workout schedule that gets you moving for 30 minutes a day, at least 5 days a week.It’s okay to start smaller and gradually work up to this goal.  For more extreme results, aim for 300 minutes per week of exercise.What counts as a “moderate-intensity aerobic workout” varies and can be quite creative: Walk briskly (fast enough to break a sweat), bike, swim, play tennis, dance, do workout videos at home – anything that gets your heart rate and breathing rate up and makes you sweat.Consult your healthcare professional about an appropriate exercise regime, especially if you have medical conditions or are over age 40 (for women) or 50 (for men).  Other than setting aside specific time to exercise, there are easy ways to burn calories throughout your day. Walk somewhere instead of driving, park far away from your destination, work in the garden, take your dog or a neighbor’s dog for frequent walks, play music and get energetic when you’re cleaning the house, or take the stairs instead of the elevator.Turn off the TV! People who watch fewer than 2 hours of TV a day tend to gain less weight than those who watch more.Take a walk outside after dinner instead of sitting in front of the TV. If you can’t miss your favorite program, do light to moderate exercises while you watch such as squats, crunches, or jogging in place.  A great thing about weight loss is that even small changes can improve your overall health. A normal initial goal for treating obesity is a “modest weight loss” – usually 3-5% of your total weight.For instance, if you weigh 250 lbs (114kg), you can set an initial goal of losing 7.5-12.5 lbs (3.5-5.7 kg) to start improving your health.  Losing even 5% of your body weight can reduce your risk for developing diabetes, and it may even help improve liver function.  The more weight you lose, the bigger the health benefits – but set small, attainable goals in order to stay positive and dedicated.  You don’t have to be perfect – it’s okay to treat yourself occasionally. If you meet a weight-loss or exercise goal, reward yourself. Ideally, do something fun such as seeing that movie that’s in theatres or taking a weekend trip; but if it’s a food treat you’re craving, go for it. One fattening meal won’t impede your success, and it’s important to appreciate your hard work.  Body mass index, or BMI, is defined by comparing your body weight in kgs to your height in meters. It’s usually a good measure of your amount of body fat. A BMI of 18-25 is considered normal, and obesity is classified into ranges of severity. Keep track of your BMI with your doctor to monitor your progress, and set health-conscious goals. BMI is categorized as follows:40 and higher: Extreme/morbid obesity (class III obesity)  35-39.9: Class II obesity  30-34.9: Class I obesity  25-29.9: Overweight  18.5-24.9: Normal/healthy  , When you don’t sleep enough or sleep too much, your body releases a hormone that can affect your appetite and make you crave carbohydrates.Maintain a healthy and consistent sleep schedule and get as close to 7-9 hours of sleep as you can.Try the following:Set regular times to go to bed and wake up.  Avoid napping during the day.  Leave your bedroom for sleeping – don’t watch TV or do other activities in bed.  Sleep in a cool, dark space.  Avoid caffeine after 4pm, or earlier if you’re sensitive to caffeine.  Create a relaxing ritual before bed, like taking a hot bath or having a cup of (decaffeinated) tea.  Surround yourself with friends and family who encourage your goal of overcoming obesity and maintaining a healthy weight.Invite others to cook healthy meals with you. Find a “workout buddy,” and encourage each other to exercise regularly.  The National Weight Control Registry (NWCR) is an ongoing database and investigation of people who have successfully lost weight and who are continuing to do so. This program will ask you to record your eating, health, and exercise habits by occasionally sending you questionnaires. This is a great way to help researchers understand weight loss while helping you keep track of your own habits.  To join, you must be 18 years old.

"It isn't reasonable to expect a first grader to be perfectly organized, although it is completely fair to expect them to try. Younger students typically love the idea of a star chart or prize box. They are generally not influenced by the threat of a bad grade. It's generally easier to try to instill neatness as a habit into elementary school students. Remember not to single out any very young students for being messy, as they (generally) are not very successful at taking constructive criticism.;  , Academically motivated students in High School or Middle School are typically organized: They have realized that being organized makes it easier to study and boosts their grades. For students who haven't figured this out, you need to talk to them and explain why it is important to be neat, and then you need to follow through and show that you expect them to be neat. This habit will really help them, so don't feel bad about it-its for their own good. At this age level, students won't organize their binders for a cheesy incentive like a prize box. They need some kind of disincentive.  ","if you have younger students, lower your expectations and think of creative rewards for the entire class. if you have older students, raise your expectations for their own good, talk to students individually, and explain disincentives.

"Smiling makes other people happy, and someone else might want to smile if you do.;  , Jokes can make someone smile really easily, as long as they're funny.  Hugs make someone so happy they could just drop to the ground.  If you show polite behavior, this will make others happier. For example, hold the door open for that person whenever they are trying to get in somewhere, or saying hello politely to someone when you guys meet.  Offering a random act of kindness makes others happy!  , Some people like to say their names, and they think it's nice to know that someone cares about hearing it. This will improve your relationship with that person. Remember to tell that person your name, too.  Someone might be in a bad mood because of the work they have to do. For example, help that person do the laundry, or help with a research paper that person has to do. If you offer a helping hand, there's a higher chance that that person will smile!  , Surprising someone to make them smile, or get over anger or a bad mood, is a great way to make their day. Try bringing gifts, such as flowers and chocolate.  Humility shows others that you don't always think you are perfect, and it can make others happy and brighten their days. When you are humble, you are treating people better and showing kindness and mutual respect for them.  When someone is talking to you, don't just sit and wait until they finish talking; actually listen to what they are saying. Try words that encourage the speaker to keep talking, such as 'Hmm,' 'I see,' and 'and...' Show that you are truly listening and this will make others happy.  ","smile yourself. try cracking a bit of jokes. hug the person. be polite, courteous and respectful. say something nice about that person and show them how much you care about them. if you're meeting this person for the first time, ask what their name is. offer a helping hand. think of a surprise for that person. have some humility. be a good listener.

"An important part of trash talking is to build up your own confidence. Successful trash talking can make you feel more aggressive, which often translates into better playing.For example, tell your opponent what you’re going to do before you do it. Say something like, “I’m going to dribble twice, then make a three-pointer over your head,” and then do it.If you’re competing on a team, trash talk will motivate your team members to join in and step up their game, as well.  You will play better and be under less pressure if you can trash talk and taunt your opponent. Keeping the trash talk focused on the competition will keep you from feeling self-conscious about your performance.You can do this by drawing attention to your success and your opponent’s failure. Highlighting things you do well and your competition does poorly will increase your self-esteem in the game, and you can intimidate your opponent into thinking that they don’t have a chance of winning against you.  Although losing a competitive event is never fun, you should still show dignity and sportsmanship by losing without complaining or criticizing your opponents.  There is a difference between trash talking and poor sportsmanship; a good trash-talker can still admit when an opponent out-performed them.  You can also show that you’re a good sport by lightly mocking yourself if you’re not playing well. A little self-directed trash talk will make everyone laugh and show them you’re not taking the game too seriously.  Once you’ve made it clear that you’re willing to engage in trash talk, and start trashing your opponents, you should expect your opponents to trash talk you as well.Don’t let this get into your head; stay focused on the game or event, and ignore your opponents’ trash talk.  You may be able to turn the trash talk around; if an opponent trash talks you, a sarcastic reply can give you the advantage. For example, if an opponent is boasting, reply with: “Don’t be humble, you’re not that good.”  ","build yourself up. keep the pressure on your opponent. don’t let your sportsmanship suffer. anticipate trash talk directed towards you.

"These may be your strongest arguments. Nobody knows you better than you.  Subtly refer to the fertilized egg as a human being, not a thing.  When does a fertilized become 'human?' Is it not the moment it is conceived? Does the baby suddenly snap from a funny-looking-fetus-thing to a human being at the second trimester? Show them 4D ultrasounds of babies during the allowed abortion time. It looks like, what? A baby?  , If you are unable to convince the other person, the two of you may have to simply agree to disagree.  Don't say things such as 'I'm right and you're stupid.' You'll look immature and give a bad image for your cause. Especially if you're talking to a woman who is in the process of deciding.  Even if you believe that it isn't her choice to make, bashing her will only make her resent you and your beliefs. But if she asks you for reasons why she shouldn't abort:  Discuss the reasons listed above.  If it's that she can't afford to care for the baby (which is usually the case), encourage her to have the baby and either put him or her up for adoption or drop him or her at a safe haven.  If it's that the baby is ill and might not make it anyway, remind her that he/she might not live if he/she is born, and will not live if aborted.  If the issue is that if she carries through with the pregnancy she has a risk of dying in the process: this is a very touchy subject and it's not so much a pro-life or pro-choice argument.  ","use your own reasons and arguments based on your own personal belief and experience. refer to the fertilized egg as 'he' or 'she', not 'it.', where is the line?, continue to argue to a point, but know when to stop. be respectful and professional. if you're talking to a woman who is asking you whether she should abort her baby, be very very comforting.

"Roll out your dough and cut it into 6 even pieces, about 5 ounces each.Roll the pieces into 6 individual balls  Dust your workstation with flour to prevent dough from sticking.  Roll your pieces into about 8-inch flat circles. If your dough is very warm, it may be difficult to handle, cool it in the refrigerator for about 5-10 minutes if necessary.  Evenly divide your filling into about 3/4 cup per individual pie and scoop it onto half of each dough circle. Carefully fold the dough over to cover the filling and use your fingers or a fork to press the edges together.  Use a sharp knife to cut a few slits into the top of your pies. This allows steam to escape when baking and helps to prevent the pie from cracking or bursting in the oven.  Brush the top of your pockets with egg or melted butter to keep the top moist.  Bake your pies on a lightly oiled or non-stick baking sheet in the oven for about 45 minutes to 1 hour or until the crust is golden brown and flakey.  Enjoy with a side of ketchup.

"Go with shoes you'll likely have on when you use the crutches.  , Correctly fitted, the wrist grip should line up roughly with where you usually wear a watch.  The half-circle or V-shaped cuff should sit halfway between your wrist and elbow. They shouldn't push your shoulders up when holding or make you hunch over.  This sizing is important because you'll want a 15 - 30 degree bend in your arms when using the crutches. Sizing correctly will give your arms and shoulders their full range of motion, allowing you to consistently plant the crutches at 30 degree angles.  ","put on a pair of everyday shoes. stand up as straight as possible and let your arms fall down to your sides, relaxed. , take the forearm crutch and fit the hand grip so that it falls in line with your wrist joint. fit the arm cuff mid-way up your forearm.

"You can usually do this by checking your car’s specifications, whether on the internet or with a dealer. The more recent your vehicle, the more likely it is to have ABS brakes. If you’re really unsure, you can always check with a mechanic the next time you get your car serviced., Because ABS brakes do most of the work preventing your wheels from locking, they make it easier for you to steer when you need to brake on ice. Rather than keeping your hands fixed at the 10 and 2 positions, you should shuffle your hands so they always stay on their side of the steering wheel. This means that, even if you need to turn the steering wheel harshly, your arms never cross, giving you more control.  This is very similar to the grip many race car drivers use., While they do a great job of preventing your wheels from locking, ABS brakes don’t work as well on ice and snow as they do on pavement. As such, it’s important to react quickly, then let the system work. It’s crucial to stay alert and always keep your eyes on the road., With ABS brakes, you don’t have to worry about pumping the brakes or applying steady pressure. Just push the brake pedal hard. You might feel the pedal shudder and push back against your foot slightly. This is normal; the ABS is kicking in, relieving some of the pressure from the wheels to prevent them from locking. Don’t remove your foot or pump the brakes, let the system work., Sometimes braking isn’t enough, and you might need to steer away from a possible collision. If you need to steer, make smooth, precise movements. Jerking the steering wheel can cause your car to skid and slide. The wheels will lose their traction and you’ll lose control of your vehicle.  ","confirm that your car has abs brakes. keep a firm grip on your steering wheel. brake as soon as possible. push firmly on the brakes. steer carefully to avoid obstacles. "

"You need to have someone who is willing to pick you up from the hospital and who will help you during your recovery at home. You should make sure you have this person lined up before you go into surgery.After bariatric surgery you will not be able to care for yourself. You will need someone to help you remember to take medication, assist you in getting up and down, and generally take care of you.  If you don't want to ask one person to do all this work for you, consider asking friends or loved ones to take shifts. You could have one person pick you up from the hospital, one person stay with you at night, and another person to care for you during the day.;  , Once you wake up after surgery you should be kept there until you can walk at least a few steps on your own. This may take between 24 and 48 hours. This time allows the medical staff to know that you are medically stable and that your pain is under control enough to allow you to get home without too much distress.  Leaving the hospital too early can be dangerous to your health. If you have negative side effects from the surgery, such as internal bleeding, it is important that they are caught before you leave the hospital. Overall, it is important that you become medically stable before you leave the care of your doctor and nurses., When you have the surgery, you will be given a local anesthetic to numb the area of the incision or you will be given general anesthesia. After you are released from the hospital, this anesthetic on the incision area will gradually wear off. Your doctor may prescribe pain medication for you to take after the surgery.When taking pain medications you should avoid operating heavy machinery, such as driving a car. You should also be careful to use the medication as prescribed and let your doctor know if you are taking any other medications or have any allergies to other medications., It is important that you do not exert yourself too much while you are recovering from surgery. Too much physical exertion could open up the incision or damage the changes made inside your body.Most people that undergo bariatric surgery can drive a car within two weeks.  Wait four to six weeks to return to all normal activities, such as lifting heavy objects or doing high-impact exercise.  Your surgeon should schedule a checkup exam within a week or two of your surgery. The doctor will ask you how you are doing and they will also inspect your incision site to make sure it is healing correctly.  When you go to your checkup exam, ask your surgeon any questions you have about the surgical recovery or the procedure.  For several months after surgery, it's important not to overtax your digestive system. At each stage of the diet, divide your food into several small meals a day. Eat or drink slowly, taking at least half an hour for each meal. Eating too quickly after bariatric surgery can cause too much food to enter your intestine, causing vomiting, dizziness, and diarrhea.Foods high in fat and sugar are more likely to cause these symptoms.  You can try different strategies to help you eat slower, such as waiting two or three minutes between bites. Chewing food extremely thoroughly is recommended during recovery, and will also slow your eating., The hospital should have you consult with a registered dietitian after your surgery. Typically, the first day or so of recovery involves a clear liquid diet to allow your digestive system to ease back into digestion. Sip the liquid slowly and drink no more than 3 ounces (90 mL) at a time.Clear liquids include clear stock, water, and herbal tea., Your doctor or dietitian will likely recommend vitamin and/or calcium supplements, since you may have trouble getting enough of these on your new diet (even after recovery). Take these as directed.If you had a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, one type of bariatric surgery, it's especially important to get extra B vitamins, iron, and calcium. This is less of an issue for gastric banding patients., If everything is going well after a day or so, you can start drinking more liquid (still sipping slowly), and opaque liquids such as low-fat milk, broth, and strained cream soup. After several days, you can eat solid foods pureed with liquid to make a smooth paste. Lean ground meat, beans, and cooked vegetables are examples of foods that puree well.Consult your dietitian regularly and let them know if you have any trouble digesting food.  High protein foods can help you recover faster. Nutrition shakes and pureed meats or beans are good sources of protein.  Remember to eat small meals throughout the day. Try starting with six meals, each comprised of ½ to 1 cup (120 to 240 mL) of food and liquid.  After a few weeks, with doctor's approval, add small pieces of easily chewed food to your diet. Finely diced meat, soft fruit, or soft cooked vegetables are all good options. Chew each bite thoroughly to a pureed consistency before swallowing, to avoid blocking your now narrower digestive tract.Remove the skin and seeds from fruits and vegetables before eating.  Your stomach capacity may not be large enough to handle a drink as well as a nutritious meal. Wait 30 to 45 minutes after each solid food meal, then slowly sip liquids. It should take you about 30 to 60 minutes to drink one cup (240 mL)., You can typically introduce firmer foods eight weeks after surgery, starting with small amounts of finely diced food. You can then slowly ramp up to larger pieces and harder foods, achieving your new permanent diet within four months. Consult with your doctor and registered dietitian regularly to make sure your digestive system can handle the changes, since this schedule can vary.Introduce each 'new' food one at a time to see how you respond.  At this stage, avoid nuts and seeds; stringy or fibrous foods such as corn and tough meat; carbonated drinks; dried fruit; bread; and fried food. Use caution with spicy food and crunchy food. You can try these foods later on, with professional guidance.  Treat alcohol with extreme caution. You will likely absorb it (and become drunk) much faster than you did before the surgery. You are also now at higher risk for alcohol-related disorders and health problems, such as ulcers., Even after full recover, your diet and eating habits will likely be drastically different than they were before. Your doctor and dietitian can give you specific advice based on the type of surgery you had. The general rules you followed during recovery may help you adapt to your permanent diet as well. Because you are not eating much food overall, a significant portion of it should be protein sources to meet your needs. Continue to minimize fat and sugar, take vitamin supplements, and avoid fluids at mealtimes., Five or six small meals per day work well for many people, with each meal no large than ½ to 1 cup (4-8 oz / 120–240 mL). The size of your digestive tract has been permanently decreased, so you will always need to restrict yourself to small quantities of food to avoid nausea, diarrhea, and other unpleasant symptoms.You will also need to chew your food thoroughly before swallowing. Also consider grinding all meat that you eat before you cook it. This will allow you to better digest it.  Exercise is essential to keeping healthy and maintaining a healthy weight. Find exercise routines that your find fun and entertaining, as well as exercises that make your sweat and work hard. With a combination of fun and challenging exercises, you are more likely to keep doing it on a regular basis.Consider hiring a personal trainer to keep you motivated and on task when you are exercising.  Explore new activities that give you new ways to get exercise. For example, start hiking and see if exploring nature on foot will motivate you to exercise more.  Right after bariatric surgery, you are likely to experience a significant weight loss period. However, after that period of extreme weight loss, you will need to find a way to maintain your new weight. This can be best accomplished by maintaining a healthy lifestyle that includes moderation in eating and regular exercise. To help you maintain this new lifestyle, seek out nutritional counseling and psychological support.Getting support from professionals and following your doctor's instructions about diet and exercise has been shown to drastically increase your chances of maintaining your weight loss.  Hopefully everything with your surgery and recovery will go smoothly. However, you should be aware of the things to look for that could signal a problem. Problems with your bariatric surgery could occur right after surgery or long afterwards.As you recover from surgery, look for signs of infection at the incision site. This can include pus or discharge coming from the wound or excessive tenderness and redness.  Pay attention to your digestion after surgery. It will take a few weeks for your digestion to normalize but it should eventually. If you continue to have indigestion, nausea, or vomiting, you should let your doctor know.  If you have a gastric balloon, the balloon is filled with dye that will turn your urine blue or green if it is leaking. If you have this happen, contact your doctor right away.

"Follow the specific recipe you are using, including ingredient amounts, utensils and baking dishes, steps or instructions, oven temperatures, and baking times.;  , Using a damp knife, cut the cake in sections or quarters. This allows the insides of the cake to cool down faster, rather than having the cake cool down from the outside in.  When the cake pieces has reached room temperature or warm to handle, use your hands to crumble the cake in a large mixing bowl. You will want to break down any chunks, especially any hard corners.  Start off with 1/4 cup of icing in the bowl. Use a wooden spoon to thoroughly incorporate the cake crumbs and icing together until you achieve a consistency of dough, as if you're making cookie dough. Add additional icing, if needed.  Having the mixture chilled makes it easier for you to roll it into balls. Refrigerate until firm, or about one hour.  Use a cookie dough scooper to help you make even ball amounts, about 1 tablespoon (15 grams). To avoid multitasking, scoop the entire mixture and place the balls onto a flat surface (such as a baking sheet or counter top), lined with parchment paper.  Use both palms of your hands and circle each ball in a circular motion, to allow any flat surfaces become evenly round.  For the best results, it's recommended to refrigerate the cake balls for at least two hours. By doing this, any coating won't affect the prepared cake when dipping.  You can either use a microwave-safe bowl or create a double boiler. Stir the chocolate to make sure everything is melted evenly.  Prick them in the center, just enough to pick them up from the parchment paper and hold.  If you're wanting to present the cake balls on a stick, it's recommended to use lollipop sticks, which can be found in specialty baking aisles. Dip about 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) of the stick into the melted chocolate prior to inserting them into the cake balls.  If you're wanting to present the cake balls in decorative individual wrappers, poke them with toothpicks.  While holding the lollipop stick or toothpick, submerge the cake ball into the melted chocolate. When lifting it back up, gently lift them in a swirling motion or give them a gentle shake.  If you are using toothpicks, remove them from the balls. Add a very small amount of extra melted chocolate to cover the holes. You can use the back of a spoon to evenly spread out any extra coating as well.  Place the chocolate covered cake ball in the same place on the waxed paper. Pick up the next one and repeat the dipping until everything is covered.  You can create even zig-zag lines by moving your arm back and forth in a uniform way across the entire sheet of cake balls., You can either sprinkle by hand or dip it in the sprinkles while the chocolate is still in a liquid state, if you're not drizzling chocolate on top.  To ensure a hard coating and for any topping to appear more uniform, place the cake balls in the freezer or refrigerator for about an hour or two.  Now enjoy and serve your yummy cake pops!

Discuss these rules and expectations openly to ensure you are on the same page., While continued communication and trust-building will be important, your fragile relationship will benefit from spending time and effort on new experiences.Consider activities you've enjoyed in the past that you could reestablish as productive habits.  Discuss your goals and interests. Perhaps your partner has always wanted to travel. You might consider spending some time researching trips or even pursuing language or cultural instruction to make that dream a reality. Perhaps he or she has been thinking about running a half marathon. If you can share this vision, commit to achieving this goal together -- or, if you aren't a runner yourself, commit to becoming your partner's top cheerleader.  However painful, your cheating is now in the past. Focus upon the possibilities of your future together while recognizing you're now called to higher standards of accountability and emotional communication., If sexual intimacy was part of your relationship in the past, set a goal of reestablishing sufficient trust to renew this commitment.Be mindful that while your relationship is a partnership, the wounded partner needs to set the parameters for this process. Fulfilling intimacy requires considerable trust.  Ensure you've been tested for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Never risk your partner's physical health -- or the emotional devastation that would result from an STD diagnosis.  ","recommit to your 'new' relationship. spend quality time together doing things unrelated to your experiences of infidelity. stay 'present oriented.', work toward reestablishing your sense of shared intimacy.

"There are a number of risk factors for gangrene, most of which can be avoided. They include:Smoking  Obesity  Excessive alcohol consumption  Diabetes  Impaired immune function (from an autoimmune disease like HIV or treatment such as chemotherapy)  Intravenous drug use  Use of warfarin, an anticoagulant drug, though this is very rare. Using both warfarin and heparin together can increase your risk.;  , If you're at risk for gangrene because of a condition such as diabetes, it's important to check your feet over every day for possible problems. If you have trouble looking at the bottom of your feet, have someone help you or use a mirror. Watch for the following symptoms:Discoloration, going from red to dark and black  A clear line between healthy skin and affected skin  A foul smell (for wet gangrene)  A shiny appearance to the skin  Coldness in the extremity  Pain, followed by loss of sensation  Loss of pulse in arteries  , Even if you don't shower every day, you should wash your feet in warm water (about 90 to 95°F or 32 to 35°C). Try not to soak your feet, as that can lead to dry skin. Instead, wash with gentle soap, then wash the soap away. Dry your feet thoroughly, including between your toes.When you have corns or callouses, be gentle. Don't use razor blades or chemical removers, as they can be too harsh on your skin. Instead, gently smooth them away after you bathe. An even better solution is getting a podiatrist to take care of the problem.After you wash, be sure to put on a good lotion. Keeping your feet moisturized can help prevent cracked heels and other types of cuts.  Make sure to wash any cuts with soap and water to stave off infection. Keep them dry otherwise, and covered with sterile dressing., Trimming your toenails is important in preventing gangrene, as not trimming them can lead to ingrown toenails and cuts. Try to trim them at least once a week or when you notice they grow out longer. Your doctor or podiatrist can help if you can't do it yourself.Don't round toenails off like you do your nails. You should cut them straight across to prevent ingrown toenails.  Smooth off the edges with a file.  Throughout the day, get your blood moving to your feet by tapping your feet and wiggling your toes. More blood circulation means better healing when you do get cuts, so moving around can help prevent a bad infection from setting in., Make sure you are going in for your yearly checkups. Your doctor knows what to look for when it comes to gangrene, and she may catch something you miss. In addition, watching a doctor check your feet can help you know how to do it properly yourself., It can be tempting to run outside for a minute without your shoes; however, even a small dash outside can lead to a cut you don't feel, which in turn could eventually lead to gangrene. Putting your shoes on to protect your feet is an important part of maintaining foot health.It can also be a good idea to wear slippers around the house, so you don't stub your toe or step on something you shouldn't.  In fact, some doctors recommend wearing socks and shoes at all times, even indoors, to protect your feet.Also, put socks on. Wearing shoes without socks can lead to a number of abrasions or cuts, as well as blisters. If you're diabetic, cuts may not heal as easily, which in turn could lead to gangrene. Always wear socks with your shoes to help protect your feet from problems., When picking out shoes, make sure they fit properly. Walk around in them a bit to make sure they are comfortable everywhere. In addition, make sure you have room to wriggle your toes. You don't want anything too narrow that will squeeze them.It's best to shop at night rather than in the morning, because your feet swell during the day.  If you can get away with it, athletic shoes are the best option because they provide the most support and comfort. Skip anything that leaves your foot exposed, as you could damage your foot.  Also, don't break in shoes all at once. Wear them for a couple of hours each day, so you don't end up with a blister.  If you have nerve damage in your feet, it's easy to damage them with extreme temperatures. Therefore, you should keep your feet away from heat sources such as hot pavement, beaches, and radiators, and wear sunscreen on your feet if they are exposed. Also, try to skip extreme colds, such as ice packs, and keep your feet warm in the winter with socks at night and during the day., Diabetes is one of the main diseases that can lead to gangrene. If your diabetes is out of control, you likely have too much sugar or glucose in your blood. That, in turn, can lead to nerve damage and low blood flow. Nerve damage means you don't have as much sensation in your feet, and cuts can go unnoticed, which in turn, can lead to gangrene., One way to help manage your diabetes is through diet. As a diabetic, you have to eat a good balance of protein, fruits and vegetables, and healthy carbohydrates. You need enough carbohydrates and protein to keep your blood sugar up, while not eating so many that your blood sugar gets too high.One way to focus on healthy eating is to divide your plate. A quarter of it should be devoted to healthy whole grains, such as brown rice or whole wheat bread. Another quarter should be a healthy protein, such as fish or chicken.  The other half should be taken up with fruits and vegetables.  Also, try to replace any sugary drinks, such as juice or soda, with water or unsweetened tea.  Talking to a nutritionist to help you set up a healthy eating plan.  Exercising more can also help you stay healthy and manage your diabetes. You should be exercising at least three times a week. If you haven't been exercising much, start small, such as taking a 10 minute walk each time, and then work up to longer.When picking out exercises, try to choose ones that are easy on your feet. For instance, walking is pretty easy on your feet, as is swimming and bicycling.  Exercises that require you to run or jump are much harder on your feet., Checking your blood sugar can help you manage your diabetes. It can tell you when you may need to eat more at certain meals, as well as when your blood sugar is getting too high, and you need to eat less.Your doctor will let you know how many times a day you need to check your blood sugar.  For example, if your blood sugars are particularly unstable, you may need to check them before every meal, as well as one to two hours after every meal to see how it fluctuates throughout the day, as well as bedtime. If you are more stable, you may be able to check it only twice a day.  If you are having trouble managing your diabetes at home, don't be afraid to talk to your doctor. He may need to put you on a different medication to help you better manage your diabetes, or they may even need to start you on insulin., Alcohol can make your diabetes worse. In addition, it can raise your blood pressure and your cholesterol, which can increase your chances of developing gangrene. Therefore, it's best to try to cut down on your alcohol intake.Men should limit themselves to one to two drinks a day, while women should stick with one or less.  One drink is a single beer (12 ounces), a glass of wine (5 ounces), or one shot of hard liquor (1.5 ounces)., Before you quit, it's important to make sure you know the reason you want to quit.Smoking can increase your likelihood of developing gangrene, so that can be a good motivator for wanting to quit.Smoking worsens the effects of nerve damage. It can lead to smaller blood vessels that aren't as flexible, which means your feet aren't getting as much blood.  When you have a wound, blood flow helps heal the wound. Therefore, smoking can slow down the healing process, which in turn can lead to gangrene.  The national Quit hotline is 1-800-QUITNOW or 1-800-784-8669. When you call the hotline, you'll be put in touch with someone who can get you started with quitting. They can also put you in contact with local resources that can help you quit., Often, people will smoke at a certain time of day, with certain people, or during a certain activity. If you know what will trigger you to smoke, you can start combating them by having a plan of action in place.For instance, if you like to smoke after dinner, take the family for a walk instead.  If you're a fan of smoking and playing pool, you might need to stop playing pool for a bit.  Nicotine replacements include patches, tablets, inhalers, gum, and several other options. They give you a dose of nicotine to help you deal with the cravings, and they can help you deal with the withdrawal symptoms. Since nicotine is the addictive part of cigarettes, getting smaller doses of that particular drug can help you quit., If your friends and family know you want to quit, they can help you to do it. For instance, if they see you wanting to light up, they can discourage you to stop. If one of them smokes, they can quit asking you if you want one, too, when they light up. They can also help you deal with some of the other symptoms of withdrawal, such as depression and anxiety, by being there when you need to talk.Often, you will taper off of these much like you might taper off of cigarettes. For instance, you may take half a dose after two weeks of being on them.

"Humor is good for distracting yourself from negative thoughts or memories. Looking at a meme account with a long history is also a great way to keep yourself chuckling and in good spirits. Head to Instagram and search for '#meme' until you find an account that has a style of humor that you enjoy.  Beware that watching TV in excess is a sedentary behavior which can be linked to a shorter lifespan and obesity.Avoid snacking while watching TV as this can lead to mindless eating, and may only make you feel worse.  Try balancing your TV time with physical activity such as watching while walking on a treadmill or an elliptical. If you do not have access to such equipment, you can simply perform a series of exercises during commercials or about every 15 to 20 minutes.  Music has been used to express feelings since humans first figured out how to make it. Research has also shown that it's helpful to reduce stress and promote relaxation.Music with about 60 beats per minute can encourage your brainwaves to synchronize with that beat, resulting in a relaxed state.  While popular conceptions suggest that only 'soft' music, such as classical, jazz, or New Age, are relaxing, new research suggests otherwise. A recent study showed that listening to 'extreme metal music' helped participants process feelings of anger and return to feeling positive and even inspired.What seems to matter the most is what feels best for you. Listen to music you enjoy and connect with.  A moderate amount of computer use can be entertaining and relaxing. Online you can play games, go window shopping for clothes or accessories, catch up with old friends via social networks, read interesting articles about your favorite topics or write some articles for wikiHow. Take note of how much time you're spending on the computer.  Research shows that more than two hours of screen time for kids can be potentially damaging to health, leading to weight gain, aggression, and disrupted sleep patterns.

"Be sure to pick a saucepan large enough to fit a mixing bowl inside. Fill the pan with a few inches of water, and set it on a burner turned to medium heat. When the water is simmering, place the mixing bowl inside the pan.Don't use too much water. You only need enough to get the mixing bowl hot; make sure you don't use so much that water gets into the mixing bowl.  Heat the water only to simmering, not boiling.  Place the egg whites, sugar, and corn syrup in the bowl. Use a spoon to stir them together. Switch to a whisk and keep stirring as the mixture heats up and the sugar dissolves.  Use a candy temperature to check the temperature of the mixture. When it reaches 160 degrees, it's ready for the next stage.  Be sure not to let the mixture get hotter than 160 degrees; otherwise, it will burn.  You can check to see if the mixture is hot enough by examining the texture; the sugar should be completely dissolved, and the mixture should look clear. It should take about 2 minutes.  Using a whisk or an electric mixer, beat the icing until it whips into fluffy, glossy peaks. Add the vanilla and keep beating for a total of five minutes. Remove the icing from heat and keep beating if necessary until the frosting reaches the texture you desire. It's now ready to use on your cake or cupcakes.  7 minute icing is a popular choice for birthday cakes, since it has a pretty white color and classic vanilla flavor.  You can flavor this icing with lemon or another type of extract as well.  ","place a mixing bowl in a pan of simmering water. make the icing mixture. check the temperature. whip the icing. "
"This is a temporary measure. The cat can be reintroduced to his entire domain after these other steps have been accomplished.;  , Something like an end table, a chest, a wall, or even a cinder block or two. Again, this doesn't have to stay there in the long run. It is just to end the destruction immediately.  Not just any scratching post. It needs to be as tall as what he is destroying now. So measure up to the highest point of the damage. This is probably going to be somewhere around 24', and it wouldn't hurt to go up to 35' or even 48' when you get your cat's new post. The post also needs to be stable. This means that the base needs to be EITHER at least 60% of the height of the post (for a 24' post, the base should be at least about 14 1/2' square), or made from heavy material, like 5/8' to 3/4' panel. Finally, this scratching post should be wrapped with 3/8' Brazilian sisal rope. It can be wrapped on the top half with this rope. Not recommended: hemp, jute, or manila. Totally carpeted scratching posts could be considered, but this 3/8' Brazilian sisal rope is very long-lasting, and cats find that they can really sink their claws into it for a satisfying scratch that is likely to be repeated. Carpet, like corrugated cardboard (sometimes used for scratching pads), will leave a big mess on the floor, and will also need to be replaced frequently. Many sisal rope scratching posts can last upwards of 8 years. Many scratching posts are made with 1/4' sisal rope. In addition to having a shorter life, they are typically prone to being too loosely wrapped to be of much use. There are cheap 'traffic cone' scratching posts sold in all the major pet supply stores, and they are bound to be ignored by the cat.  But after being shown by your vet the proper way to do this regular bit of cat maintenance, it can become routine. The best time to clip a cat's claws is when he is relaxed and sitting - maybe even sleeping - next to you. Many times, this task can be accomplished swiftly without disturbing the cat.  If the cat generally sits with you while you watch TV, put it at the entrance to this room. Other high traffic areas are just inside the room where the cat is fed, at the entrance to the room where his litter box is, and near a window where he likes to sit & watch birds.  An effective method is included as a source, here.  Water is terrifying to a lot of cats, and it's just not necessary to intimidate your cat in any way for any reason. This also applies to striking, yelling at, or otherwise imposing your substantial size advantage on your critter.  ,, He'll also appreciate a loving scratch on the top of his head for being a good cat.  ","to put an end to this immediately, it is necessary to put something solid - like a door - between your cat and the couch (or any other item he is scratching inappropriately. if there is no way to isolate the cat, it would be best to put something heavy (heavier than the cat) up against the damaged furniture. an essential piece of cat gear is the scratching post. clipping your cat's claws is something that takes some getting used to. after getting the brazilian sisal rope scratching post (best to get 2 or 3) set up, it should be placed in a high traffic area. the best way to teach a cat to use a scratching post is to help him discover the post on his own, with the aid of a simple piece of string. spraying a cat with water is not a desirable way to deter him from improper scratching. while catnip can be a nice addition to a cat's diet and can make him silly and wacky, this harmless herb alone will not show a cat how to use a proper scratching post. , once the cat has established a habit of scratching on the sisal rope scratching post, he can be reintroduced into the entire house, and obstructions can most likely be removed. , it's always a good practice to make gentle, soothing, and encouraging sounds when your cat is scratching his post.

"If you want to juggle fire at night when it's more impressive (you do), then you should practice juggling ordinary clubs at night. If you're busy at night or it's daytime and you're impatient, close your eyes. When you juggle fire, it's a lot harder to see the handle because it's just not nearly as bright as the fire. Imagine juggling with clubs whose handles are basically invisible.;  , No matter how safe you assure people this is, some people just naturally worry about their building or wildlife catching on fire. In general, do not do this inside, near dry grass, on school grounds, or in a crowded area.  And put your bucket in a larger bucket. Dipping your torches into a bucket of fuel is a lot easier than trying to squirt it on. Any fuel that drips off your torches should run into the bottom of the larger bucket. Put a lid on your fuel to prevent it from drying up., A fire extinguisher and a bucket of water are good, but it's also a good idea to have spotters on hand with fire blankets just in case. They are commonly called duvetyne blankets. You probably won't need them but just in case.  After dipping in the fuel, give them a good shake. Aim this shake toward the ground! If you don't do this, you run the risk of splattering everyone with fire. Do this away from where you plan to be lighting the torches. You don't want to accidentally drop and end up setting the ground around you alight.  Light one torch first, either with a lighter or from someone else' torch. Hold it in front of you, pointed up, and light the other two.  If you do this right, you will now be confronted with spinning fire right in front of your face. Don't be afraid of this. Juggle normally, and concentrate on your catches.  Picking up a fallen torch is a lot more fun than catching the fire in your hand. Get out of the way.

"You will need a pack of white rice - ideally you would use one that is almost or at its expiration date, but otherwise you can just purchase the cheapest pack of rice you can find. You will need one cup of rice per color of your choice. You will also need  White vinegar – ½ a teaspoon per color. So if you're making five colors then that’s 2.5 tablespoons of vinegar.  Variety of food colors – red, green, blue, yellow and orange  Essential oils (lavender, eucalyptus or tea tree oil) to neutralize the scent of vinegar.  Reusable plastic containers – empty ice cream tubs or empty cookie containers with lids from the grocery store will do.  An empty, flat space in your house where you can spread the rice out for drying. You can use shallow cardboard boxes, shoe boxes or empty baking trays.;  , Put a couple of drops of food coloring in a small bowl then add ½ a teaspoon of vinegar. Add the food coloring and vinegar to the rice, then add a couple of drops of the essential oil of your choice.  Alternatively, you could color the rice using Colorations Liquid Watercolors. Add these liquid watercolors directly to the rice and shake it well. You don't need to leave the rice to dry when using this product.  Then remove the lid and pour the rice onto an empty baking tray and leave in the open to dry for a day. Proceed to coloring your next batch of rice.  You will need a pack of white rice - ideally you would use one that is almost or at its expiration date, but otherwise you can just purchase the cheapest one you can find. You will need one cup of rice per color.  Rubbing alcohol or hand sanitizer – ½ a teaspoon for every cup of rice. So if you want to make five colors then that’s 2.5 tablespoons of rubbing alcohol or hand sanitizer.  Variety of food colors – red, green, blue, yellow and orange  Reusable plastic containers – empty ice cream tubs or empty cookie containers with lids from the grocery store will do.  An empty, flat space in your house where you can spread the rice out for drying. You can use shallow cardboard boxes, shoe boxes or empty baking trays.  Put a couple of drops of food coloring in a small bowl then add ½ a teaspoon of rubbing alcohol. Pour the contents of the bowl onto the rice in the container. Since you’re using rubbing alcohol, there’s no need to use any essential oils.  Some parents shy away from using rubbing alcohol because kids may accidentally place the rice in their mouth.  Rubbing alcohol and hand sanitizers technically make the rice inedible as opposed to using vinegar.  Then remove the lid and pour the rice onto an empty baking tray and leave in the open to dry for a day. Proceed to coloring your next batch of rice.  Colored rice that's been made with rubbing alcohol usually lasts for 6 to 7 months, provided it's been stored in a sealed container without moisture seeping in. Colored rice made with vinegar usually lasts up to 4 months.  You can scoop a handful of each of the different colors of rice into separate clear plastic bottles with screw caps on. Kids can then shake these bottles to stimulate their hearing as well as coordination of their hands and arm muscles.  You can pour a few scoops of each color of rice into a box or bin and add different kinds of materials, from miniature toys, to felt shapes, to colored balls and fabric pompoms that you can find at most craft stores.  The idea is to bombard your child’s sense of sight and touch with colors, shapes and textures, with the colored rice serving as a backdrop.  Place each color of rice in a separate container and give your child a shovel or a small scoop and her own container. Ask her to pour the colored rice from the main containers into her own, where she can mix the colors as she likes  , Place the different colored rice in small ziplock bags and label each bag with their corresponding color. This will teach the child about colors and at the same time, stimulate her sense of touch.  For older kids, use the colored sensory rice as the backdrop for a little craft project. You can pour the colored rice into a shoebox and add some miniature things to make it look like a small beach or a small underwater “aquarium” with miniature plastic fish and corals.  Listed below are some tried and tested containers for storing the colored rice:  A shallow container with lid  Cardboard box  Large plastic salad bowl  Foil roasting pan  , Storing rice in a container with a lid is preferable and recommended as it will prevent moisture in the air from spoiling the texture and color of the rice. By using the lid you can store the colored rice for a longer time as compared to storing without a lid.  You don’t have to worry about coloring the rice over and over again, as colored rice will stay for as long as you need it. The color might fade a bit over time but it won't disappear completely.  ","gather your supplies. pour a cup of rice into a container with lid. put the lid on the container and shake vigorously. gather your supplies. pour a cup of rice into a container with lid. put the lid back on and shake vigorously. know that there is a time limit for rice mixed with rubbing alcohol. create colorful shakers out of the rice. stimulate your child’s senses by mixing the rice with other toys. have your child play with a shovel and the rice. use labels to teach your child about colors. use the rice for an arts and crafts project. consider what kind of container you would like to use. look for a lid. be aware that the color of the rice might fade over time.

"If you are converting the weight of a real-life object, you can use a scale to weigh it. If you already know the weight in pounds, just write the number and label it 'lbs'.  Let's follow along with an example. Say that a newborn baby is weighed at the doctor's office and found to be exactly 10 pounds. We would start our conversion by writing 10 lbs on the paper.;  , This is the number of ounces in one pound.  In our example, we would multiply 10 × 16 to get 160.  Writing 'ounces' or 'oz' next to your answer is important. If you don't, it won't be clear which units you converted to. If you're doing this work for school, you may even lose points for forgetting to label.  In our example, we would write our answer as either '160 ounces' or '160 oz.' Both mean the same thing.  Division is basically the 'opposite' of multiplication. This means that dividing by the same number that you multiply by will 'undo' your work. In other words, dividing a number of ounces by 16 will get you an answer in pounds.  In our example, dividing the baby's weight in ounces by 16 gets us 160/16 = 10 lbs. Don't forget the 'pounds' label.  ","write the number of pounds. multiply by 16. don't forget the 'ounces' label. convert back to pounds by dividing by 16. "

"You can use a letter of interest to set yourself apart as a potential buyer for a particular property. In essence, the letter gives you the chance to describe yourself, your family, your situation, and any other aspects you’d like to make a lasting impression on the home’s seller.  You can maximize the effectiveness of a letter of interest in particular situations. For example, in a “seller’s market” situation, you can face competition from a crowded market of buyers all seeking the same house. A letter of interest is a tool you can use to make you stick out from the crowd.  Letters of interest are less common when both parties involved are using a realtor. If the seller uses a realtor, he or she may want to minimize any part in the selling process, and the seller’s realtor is more likely concerned with which potential buyer can close on the house quickly and for the largest percentage of the asking price.;  , Learn what you can about the current owners of the house and highlight similarities with your own life in your letter. If both you and the seller work as teachers, you can write something like, 'What would be better than to have a teacher taking care of your old house?'If you (or your partner, spouse, or children) attended the same school, work in the same sector, volunteer for the same charity, or share any other significant connections to the owners, be sure to make note of this in your letter.Don't sound too formal: I am a 30 year old alumnus of University Xyz with a degree in chemistry.Do sound approachable: The U Xyz banner at open house brought back memories — I didn't expect to meet another alumnus out here!  , Clearly express why you love this specific home and neighborhood. Write something along the lines of, 'My family and I love the beautiful backyard and look forward to many afternoons relaxing beside the pool.'Focus on specific features of the home and neighborhood that you love, such as the sunroom, yard, surrounding walking trails, etc.People are often still attached the houses they’re selling. Use this section to show the seller that you have the proper appreciation for the house. Show the seller that selling to you would leave the house in good hands.  An emotional connection between buyer and seller can be crucial to purchasing a home, so don't be afraid to use emotional language. However, honesty and authenticity always go a long way, so avoid coming across as saccharine or desperate. Don't mention sad stories: ...turned down from several houses . . . looking to escape an awful neighborhood...Do tug on heartstrings in an upbeat way: ...kids loved running down the beach . . . couldn't stop smiling when I looked at the view...  This also means you shouldn’t exaggerate what you love about the house. The current owner will know the house better than anyone, including the work it needs. Overselling how perfect the house is can easily home across as inauthentic. Don’t be afraid to mention that you’d repaint, finish the basement, etc. This also tells the seller that you’re willing to invest in the upkeep of the house.  Focus on your strengths, financial stability, and other positive characteristics that would make you the perfect homeowner. Highlight why you would make a great owner.  Don't brag: ...outstanding work ethic . . . pillar of the community...Do mention positive traits: I am community-minded and volunteer at my local school., Reiterate your excitement to purchase the house, as well as your most salient qualities. The closing paragraph of a letter of interest can be the most crucial, and thus it is important to close on a positive note.  A closing paragraph might also imagine the future you and your family will enjoy in the home. You might write, 'I would be so excited to raise my family here, and would enjoy many years creating memories in this home.'  Express your sincere appreciation for the owner's time. Include a warm thank you at the end of the letter, such as, 'Your consideration is greatly appreciated,' or similar wording. , Outline a few important reasons why you would love to (and should) live in the house, but definitely keep it under a page.  Try to avoid including too much detail about your own life story, and avoid complaining about the difficulties you might be experiencing in finding a home.  ","learn when a letter of interest can benefit you. form a connection. tell the buyer why you love the home. write emotionally but authentically. paint a positive picture of yourself. save the best for last. keep the letter short.

"If delays are anticipated for business or other economic reasons, a suspension-of-work clause allows the owner to temporarily pause construction.  Typically suspension-of-work clauses provide for some payment to the contractor during the down time, or some adjustment of the final contract price depending on how long construction is put on hold.For example, a suspension-of-work clause might say: 'The Owner may, without cause, order the Contractor in writing to suspend, delay or interrupt the Work in whole or in part for such period of time as the Owner may determine.' That clause would be followed by any adjustments made to the payment or the schedule as a result of the delay.  Some states, such as California and Virginia, have laws limiting the enforceability of these clauses, and Ohio has banned them entirely.Even in states where these clauses are not banned, courts dislike them and give little latitude to the party seeking to enforce them. Courts typically decline to enforce them if the cause for the delay was unforeseeable when the contract was made, or if the owner’s intentional acts caused the delay.Courts often throw out a “no damage for delay” clause if your contract also includes a “time is of the essence” clause. If an owner requires a contractor to complete a project as quickly as possible, the reasoning goes, he shouldn’t also be able to deny liability for expenses the contractor incurs because of his own actions., Typically this statement will include a requirement that the contractor provide notice to the owner that his progress is being hindered and request more time to complete the job.  Contractors can still get around these clauses and sue the owner for costs incurred if the owner causes delays through actions that are particularly malicious or done in bad faith.  ","allow the owner to suspend or delay work without paying compensation through a “suspension of work” clause. check to make sure a “no damage for delay” clause is enforceable in your state. include a statement that the contractor cannot file a claim for additional costs if actions by the owner cause the project to be delayed.

"Dictionaries contain definitions of words, their usage, and their origins. All of this information can help you decide if a given word is the right word to use in the section of text you're working on. Dictionaries are available in both hard-copy and online format; you may want to make use of both formats.  Use the dictionary to help you communicate better with your readers, not to inject fancy words into your writing that send them to the dictionary to understand what you're trying to say.

Specialized dictionaries exist for certain industries that have their own jargon, such as information technology, the law, or medicine. If you write a certain type of fiction, such as medical thrillers, police procedures, or science fiction, you may want to get a dictionary devoted to specialized terminology to go alongside your general dictionary.  A thesaurus is a listing of synonyms, grouping words and phrases together that have the same or similar meanings. Printed thesauruses are organized in 1 of 2 ways, either in dictionary fashion or with an index in the front, listing categories and code numbers for each subtopic, followed by the synonym groups that fall under those categories and code numbers. Online thesauruses feature a search field into which you type the word or phrase you want to find a synonym for and then list the synonyms grouped by the particular connotation (shade of meaning) of the word you typed.

"Your base should have only one entrance, and must be blocked by the initial Altar of Kings, Barracks and two Farms. You should then build an Arcane Tower in a position where it can access all your peasants but also has a reasonable range to hit enemy units on the outskirts. Every other farm should either be built in a scouting position around the map, to protect towers, or in front of your Altar, as it is your most fragile, exposed building. Every other building, the Arcane Vault, Arcane Sanctums, etc, should be built at the back of your base or they risk destruction. It is recommended to put the Arcane Vault near your entrance, so you can swiftly access potions and such when you need them.;  , Less footmen allow for faster Arcane Sanctums, keep that in mind. Get a Beastmaster as your second hero as soon as you hit Tier Two and construct your Two Arcane Sanctums.  Assault his buildings that are being constructed. Delaying him will prevent him from getting the counter-units for your double Arcane Sanctum assault. It is okay to use your Town Portal here, as you will not need it if you do everything correctly.  Reach 48 food with footmen, sorceresses and priests in a 2:1 ratio. Pick up a scroll of healing and a scroll of protection if he does not have adept spirit walkers, reach level 3 with your Archmage, pick up three ivory towers and assault the orc base. Bring six militia and construct a lumber mill with the remaining two peasants while you head to the orcish base.  Upgrade all towers into guard towers. The militia have now reverted back into peasants, so order two of them to build two scout towers, and set the remaining four on Auto-Repair.  Micromanagement will determine the winner now. The orc is likely to bring his peons to aid him--ignore them as they deal very little damage. Your guard towers will go up and the Orc player will be overrun shortly after.

"The more you see him, the more your social interactions will escalate. The key is to make things feel like they happened organically.  The first time you see each other you will have an immediate physical attraction. The second time you see each other, you might smile at one another if the attraction is mutual. The third time you may finally start a conversation.Humans enjoy familiarity so the more you create a sense of familiarity, the more you create a sense of attraction.  Location plays a role in developing an attraction because it can indicate shared interests. For example, if you are constantly seeing each other at the gym, it signals that you both keep fitness as a priority., Be careful not to overdo your interactions. It will quickly become obvious if you are going out of your way to see him. It also allows you to build intrigue and desire if you leave him wanting more after each interaction.  In the initial stages of interaction, it’s often difficult to know his schedule. Get on his radar once you know a little about his interests and schedule. Invite him to join you or inquire when he will be at a location next rather than relying on fait.You can also ask mutual acquaintances or drop hints as to where you will be to see if he picks up and joins you.  Men enjoy the thrill of the chase. If you make it obvious that you will do anything to see him and hang on his every movement, you will be less attractive than if you present yourself as independent and mysterious.

"It is likely that you received materials from your school regarding orientation. These materials should direct you on where you need to go and what you will need to do.  Thoroughly review any instructions from the school regarding where you need to go and what time. These instructions will save you from being in the wrong place at the wrong time and potentially being embarrassed, as well as missing important information.;  , The night before orientation is a great time to review with your parents what is going to happen the next day while you’re at orientation. This is important because you’ll need a thorough understanding of where you need to be and when. You may also need money to pay for certain things, depending on your school and its requirements, so you should discuss that with your parents.  If your parents are required to be involved in orientation, they will need to work that into their schedules and be aware of dates and times.  You can start a conversation with your parents by saying, “Can we talk about my orientation tomorrow? I’d like to go over a few things.”  If you would like some extra time to walk around the school to find your classrooms, talk to your parents and let them know that you would like an extra hour or so to do this. You can say, “I’d like extra time at orientation to be able to walk around and see my classrooms” to start a conversation with your parents about this.  Work with your parents or guardians to determine who will pick you up and drop you off or how to use the public transportation in your area, if applicable. Maybe you will even choose to walk or bike to your orientation if you live close enough.  If your parents will be picking you up and dropping you off, work with them to determine what time you need to be there and what time you should be leaving the house to be there on time. Then work to determine how long you will be there and what time they should plan to pick you up. You can ask, “What time should we leave the house in the morning so that I get to orientation on time?”  If one of your friends is going to orientation at the same time as you, you can ask if their parents would mind picking you up and/or dropping you off. Your parents and your friend’s parents may even coordinate times that they can pick up and drop off you and your friend. Ask your parents’ permission before doing this. You can also arrange to be with your friend at orientation, which could make it much more fun.  If you will be using public transportation, look at bus/train schedules to find out what time you need to be at the bus or train stops. Google Maps will often provide routes via public transportation, which can be very useful and save you time.If you are walking, make sure that you know exactly how to get there. Talk to your parents about which route to take if you are unsure.  If you plan to ride your bike, look it over night before. Make sure that the tires have air in them and that your bike is in working order. It would be a good idea to take it for a test ride if it’s not too dark out. If the bike is broken, you will need to repair it yourself, ask a parent to assist you repair it, or take it to a shop.  It’s a good idea to bring a backpack to orientation because it is likely that you will be bringing home plenty of books and papers.  Make sure to pack any forms that you or your parents filled out. Designate a special folder for these forms so that you don’t lose them in the bottom of your backpack or get them mixed in with other papers.  You can ask your parents if they have filled out the necessary forms by posing the question: “Have you filled out the forms for my orientation? I’m getting ready to pack my backpack.”  If your high school provided you with a list of things that you’ll need for orientation, review the list and make sure that everything is in your backpack and ready to go. If you need assistance, ask a parent or guardian for help with the task by saying, “Can you please help me make sure that I have everything on my list for orientation?”  , It’s a good idea to have the next day’s outfit picked out and ready to go the night before so that you don’t spend too long deciding what to wear the next morning and end up being late to your orientation.  Pick out your outfit and set it aside on a hanger or neatly folded somewhere in your room.  Pick out what shoes you would like to wear and set them near your outfit so that you know where they are and they are ready to go.  Decide how you plan to style your hair for orientation. If you need to prepare anything for your hair the night before, you will be able to do so by already deciding how you plan to style your hair.  Set out your toiletries in the bathroom or bedroom (depending on your preference). This is a good time to determine which shampoo, conditioner, soap, hair products, makeup (if applicable), and hair brushes you would like to use in the morning and have them ready to go.  If you shower at night, make sure that you have the toiletries for your morning routine ready to go in your bedroom and/or bathroom to save time by having to look for things or not knowing what you would like to use.  It’s a good idea to get plenty of rest the night before orientation so that you are well-rested and ready to face the day. If you have a nightly routine, start it a little earlier than usual and take your time so that you can prepare your mind and body for sleep.  If you have trouble sleeping, a great way to fall asleep is to read while you are in bed.  If you are worried about falling asleep quickly, try sipping on a warm drink before you go to bed, such as warm milk or chamomile tea. The warmth of the drink will help you relax.  Taking a warm shower or bath before bed can help you fall asleep quickly. This is because the warmth of the shower or bath raises your body temperature and the subsequent cooling effect of stepping out of the shower or bath lowers your body temperature, inducing drowsiness., Waking up early will ensure that you will have plenty of time to get ready and prepare for the day ahead. Waking up early in general can be correlated with better grades.Set your alarm clock an hour earlier than you normally do so that you do not have to rush and can have a relaxing morning routine. Using an alarm clock will help wake you up at the desired time.  If you have a phone, you can set an alarm using your iPhone or Android phone. This is generally done by using the default alarm application or downloading a third-party alarm application to use.  Avoid hitting the snooze button. It’s an important day and you need to make sure that you are able to leave your house on time and not be late to your orientation.  Eat breakfast.  Brush your teeth.  Shower, if you choose to.  Get dressed with the clothes you set out the night before.  Style your hair, if you choose to.  Apply makeup, if applicable.  Before leaving the house, check your backpack to make sure that you have all the required forms, documents, and materials for orientation.  If you have a schedule, look at it to see where you need to be at the time you have arrived. You may have to wait around for a bit, depending on how early you are.  Follow all directions and listen carefully in the orientation. Take notes if you feel you need to.  Remember that you can socialize with friends anytime, but the information you are getting at your orientation is critical to understanding how your school works and what the expectations are for its students.  If you know that some of your friends are going to orientation at the same time as you, arrange a time and place for you and your friends to meet. This way, you’ll have someone familiar by your side while you are learning about your new school.  Call, text, or message your friends the night before to find out what time they are going to be at their orientation. If they are going at the same time as you, ask if they would like to meet somewhere and go through orientation together. Being with a friend can make orientation much more fun!  Remember to pay attention to information being given to you, even though you are with your friends. You don’t want to miss out on anything important.  If you do not already have your schedule for school, it is likely that you will be receiving it at orientation. Follow the instructions given to you at your orientation to obtain your schedule.  Once you receive your schedule, look it over to make sure that it is correct. If the classes look incorrect, ask a nearby teacher or instructor for help. You can say, “Excuse me, would you mind helping me? It looks like I have the wrong class on my schedule.”  Review your schedule carefully to see what time your classes are and what classrooms they are located in.  If you are with friends, you can compare your schedule with theirs to see if you share any classes. This can be the most exciting part of receiving your schedule!  , This often involves standing in a line to get your picture taken. You may or may not receive the card the same day that you get the picture taken.  When it is your turn, follow the photographer’s instructions. They may tell you to face your body a certain way or to tilt your head in a certain direction. This is so that the pose in the picture looks consistent with the other students’ pictures and so that your posture looks nice in the photo as well.  After the photo is taken, depending on how your school works, you may receive the photo ID a few minutes afterward. If that is the case, you may be directed to stand in line again to receive your ID.  After you receive your school ID, be sure to store it in a safe spot in your backpack or wallet.  If you are receiving your textbooks at orientation, follow the instructions provided to you for getting them. Your school may have a “book room” that holds all of the textbooks. You may have to wait in a long line to receive your textbooks.  When it is your turn, give your name or present your schedule to the teacher or school employee working there. They will retrieve the books for you.  When you receive your textbooks, store them in your backpack.  Once you have your schedule and information about your locker, you can find where it is located and make sure that the combination provided works and that the locker opens.  Look over your locker to see if there is any damage. If there is, report it to a teacher or school employee.  Practice opening and closing your locker a few times so that you are familiar with it.  Once you have your schedule, and you are finished with your orientation activities, walk around the school to find your classrooms. This can be a fun activity to do with your friends.  Obtain a map of the school if you do not know your way around. You can ask teachers or school employees if they have any maps or where you can find one.  Once you know the location of your classrooms, try walking to them in the same order as your schedule. This is a great way to familiarize yourself with the routes you will be taking to classes every day.  If you have time, ask some students what grade they are in (even if you already know) to start a conversation. This is a great way to meet and introduce yourself to new people!  You can start the conversation by saying, “Hi, my name is Sarah. I’m going into 10th grade. What grade are you going into?” After you have started the conversation, you can ask what teachers they have and if they have any favorite teachers.  Try talking to at least two or three different people you don’t know. It’s good to step out of your comfort zone and talk to new people. You never know when you will have things in common with them and make a new friend!  If your friend’s friends are there and you haven’t met them, try talking to a couple of them and getting to know them more. This is a great way to grow your circle of friends and meet new people, and it doesn’t require you to step out of your comfort zone as much. You can say, “How do you know Michael?” which should start up a conversation and lead to talking about other things.

"Put the egg in a pot full of water. Use warm water so it will boil faster.  You might want to boil several eggs so you can try the trick more than once or in case something happens to your first egg.;  , Put the pot on the stove set to Medium-High temperature. Let it sit there for 20 minutes while the water boils., Empty the boiling water into the sink being careful not to burn yourself. Use cold water to cool the egg, then peel the shell off. It can be helpful to tap the egg on the counter to crack the shell so that it is easier to peel., Stand the glass bottle upright with the opening skywards. This is the necessary position to perform this trick.  Make sure that you use a glass bottle. Using a plastic bottle (or a bottle made of any material other than glass) could be very dangerous.  The mouth of the bottle should be small, but still at least half the diameter of the egg (like a milk bottle).  Carefully light three matches. With extreme caution, drop them into the bottle. Wait a second or two., Quickly put the egg onto the bottle's opening, wide end up. Don’t wait too long to put the egg on the bottle or the matches will go out and this trick won’t work., After the matches go out, the egg will be pulled into the bottle. Then, you can amaze your friends with your egg in a bottle.  Use two or three small birthday candles and place them in the narrow end of your peeled hard-boiled egg. Make sure they are securely in place, but not pushed in deep enough to make the egg fall apart., Carefully (and with adult supervision) light the candles. They should burn easily.  Take your bottle and place it upside down with the candles inside of it, being careful not to seal the opening with the body of the egg for a few seconds. You need to let the candles warm up the air inside the bottle first., After a couple seconds, lower the bottle fully so that the outside opening is sealed by the egg. The candles may go out with a pop, but in moments the egg will slide up into the bottle.  This trick works because when the matches burn, they heat up the air inside the bottle and release steam (water) as a part of the combustion reaction. This process causes the air inside the bottle to expand, forcing some out of the bottle.  Once the egg seals the top of the bottle, the matches quickly run out of oxygen and go out. As the air in the bottle cools, the volume of air inside the bottle drops due to condensation of the water vapor (look for the little 'cloud' inside the bottle just as the match goes out) and the cooling of dry air.  When the volume of the air drops, it exerts less pressure on the egg, while the air pressure outside of the bottle doesn't change. The egg is pushed into the bottle once the difference between those forces is sufficient to deform the egg and overcome friction with the neck of the bottle.  ","place an egg in a pot full of water. boil the water. peel the egg. position the bottle. light the matches. place the egg on top of the bottle. watch the egg squeeze into the bottle. stick the birthday candles in one end of the egg. light the candles. put the candles in an upside-down bottle. watch the egg go into the bottle. explain how it works to your friends.

"The basis of Buddhist teaching is something called the Four Noble Truths, which are based on the idea that suffering is an intrinsic part of life, but that suffering can be ended by breaking the cycle of life, death, and rebirth.From the four truths come the Four Great Bodhisattva Vows, which are a path that can help you end suffering.  The first noble truth is the truth of suffering.  The first bodhisattva vow is the vow to rescue living beings from suffering.  In Buddhism, suffering refers to the physical and mental suffering of all human beings.  The key to ending suffering is reaching nirvana, which can be done by living according to the Noble Eightfold Path (also known as the Middle Way).;  , The two staples at the center of Buddhism are the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path. The Four Noble Truths can be understood as the belief behind Buddhism, and the Noble Eightfold Path is the discipline and practice behind that belief.Living according to the Noble Eightfold Path includes:  Right speech, action, and livelihood. The key to following these three elements involve living according to the Five Precepts.  Right effort, mindfulness, and concentration, which can be achieved by practicing meditation.  Right understanding and thought, which come about when you practice meditation, cultivate mindfulness, and live according to the Five Precepts.  The second noble truth is a recognition of the cause of suffering, which comes from desire, ignorance, and the craving of pleasure and material goods.The corresponding bodhisattva vow involves vowing to end desire and craving.  Buddhist don’t believe that suffering and desire can be ended easily. Rather, this is a pursuit that spans many lifetimes, but you can do your part by following the Noble Eightfold Path.  The third noble truth is the understanding that suffering can end, and this means suffering both in life and in spiritual terms. The answer to the end of suffering is learning, enlightenment, and action.  The corresponding vow for the third noble truth is to learn about dharma and how it affects suffering., The fourth truth in Buddhism has to do with the path that leads to the end of suffering, which was the path of the Buddha. Suffering ends when one finds enlightenment and nirvana, which is the end of suffering.  To obtain nirvana, you must strive to live your life according to the Noble Eightfold Path.  The Five Precepts in Buddhism are not commandments, but rather undertakings that you should strive toward. The first precept, which is to abstain from killing living beings, can be applied to all creatures, including humans, animals, and insects.  In positive, this precept means to be kind and to love other creatures. For many Buddhists, this precept also entails a general philosophy of nonviolence, which is why many Buddhist are vegetarian or vegan.Unlike religions that say you'll be punished if you don’t abide by the laws and rules of the religion, Buddhism focuses on the consequences that your actions will have in this life and the next.  The second precept is to abstain from taking things that aren't yours or that aren't given to you.Again, this isn't something you're commanded to do, but rather something you must want to practice. Free will and choice are very important principles in Buddhism.  This precept means don’t steal from friends, neighbors, family, strangers, or even businesses, and it could apply to money, food, clothes, and other items.  On the other side of the coin, this precept also implies that you should strive to be generous, open, and honest. Give instead of take, and help others when you can.  There are many things you can do to be generous and giving, including giving money to charity, volunteering your time, raising money and awareness for different causes, and donating gifts or money when possible.  Another important notion in Buddhism is exploitation, and practicing Buddhists should undertake not to exploit themselves and others. This includes sexual, mental, emotional, and physical exploitation.Buddhism does not mean you have to be abstinent, but it does mean that you should be conscious of your actions. If you are going to engage in sexual activity, it should only be with consenting adults.  Traditionally, Buddhist teachings also indicated that a person should not have sex with a partner who was married or engaged.  Instead of engaging in sexual misconduct, strive to practice simplicity and being content with what you have.  Truth, learning, and inquiry are also important ideas in Buddhism, which is why it’s important that people abstain from false speech. This means avoid lying, telling untruths, and hiding things from others.  Rather than lying and keeping secrets, focus on being open, clear, and truthful with yourself and others.  The fifth precept, which is to avoid substances that confuse the mind, is related to the Buddhist principle of mindfulness. Mindfulness is something that you should strive to cultivate in your daily life, and this means being aware and conscious of your actions, feelings, and behaviors.The problem with mind-altering substances is that they confuse the mind, make you forget what's important, cause you to lose focus, and can contribute to actions or thoughts that you'll regret later.  Mind-altering substances include drugs, hallucinogens, and alcohol, but could also apply to other psychoactive substances like caffeine.  Karma, or kamma, means action, and a large part of Buddhist philosophy is the importance placed on the consequences of your actions. The idea is that good actions are motivated by generosity and compassion. These actions bring about well-being in yourself and others, and they create happy results as a consequence.  To incorporate more good actions into your life, you can help people who need a hand, volunteer your time and skills to people who need you, teach others things you have learned, and be kind to people and animals.  Buddhists believe that life is a cycle of life, death, reincarnation, and rebirth. Your actions have consequences in this life, but they can also impact other lives as well.  Unlike good actions, unwholesome actions are motivated by greed and hatred, and they bring about painful results.Particularly, bad deeds will prevent you from breaking the cycle of life, death, and rebirth, meaning your suffering will continue if you inflict suffering on others.  Unwholesome actions include things like being selfish, greedy, and refusing to help other people.  Dharma is another very important notion in Buddhist teachings, because it describes the true reality of your life and the world. However, dharma is not static and unchanging, and you can change reality by changing your perception, by making different choices, and by choosing right actions.The term dharma also describes the path and teachings of Buddhism in general, so it can be thought of as the way you live your life.To practice dharma in your everyday life, try being thankful for the things you have, grateful for your life, and by enjoying life. You can show thanks through prayer, by making offerings, and by working toward enlightenment., Meditation is one of the most important practices in Buddhism, because it provides insight, stillness, quietness of mind, temporary reprieve from suffering, inner peace, and helps you on the path to enlightenment.  To meditate properly, it’s important to find a spot that’s quiet, and that will allow you to concentrate on your practice. A bedroom or other empty room is a good place.  Turn off your phone, the television, music, and any other distractions., Sit cross-legged on the floor or on a cushion if that’s comfortable for you. If you are not comfortable in that position, try kneeling, or sit on a chair.  Once you’ve found a comfortable seat, sit upright, hold your head straight, and relax your back and shoulders.Place your hands palms-down on your thighs or folded in your lap.  You can close your eyes, keep them partially open, or leave them completely open for your practice. Especially when you're first starting out, find a position and arrangement that’s comfortable and that facilitates your meditation.  If you want to keep your eyes open or partially open, shift your gaze downward and fix it on something a few feet or yards in front of you., One of the most important parts of a meditation practice is the focus on your breath. You don’t necessarily have to breathe a certain way, but you do want to concentrate on the air flowing in and out of your body.  The focus on the breath is important because it helps you concentrate on the present moment without fixing your thoughts on any one idea.  Meditation is also about being mindful and present, and focusing on your inhalation and exhalation is a great way to center yourself and be present in the moment., One of the main goals of meditation is clearing your mind and finding calmness. To start, allow your thoughts to come and to pass without getting caught up in any of them. If you find yourself becoming fixated on a particular thought during, go back to focusing on your breathing.  Do this for about 15 minutes a day for the first week. Then, extend your sessions by five minutes each week. Aim to reach 45 minutes of meditation each day.Set a timer to so you know when you can end your practice.  ","strive to end suffering. live according to the noble eightfold path. try to put an end to wanting and craving. continue learning. aspire for nirvana. avoid killing. do not steal. do not engage in sexual misconduct. tell the truth. avoid mind-altering substances. understand the importance of karma and good deeds. know the karmic consequences of bad deeds. learn about the concept of dharma. select a quiet spot. sit in a comfortable position. adjust your eyes. pay attention to your breathing. let your thoughts come and go.

"The following options can be extremely expensive and/or risky. Most experts consider these to be predatory lending practices and do not recommend them. Information about these are included here to give the reader greater understanding of how they work and the risks that come with them. Think seriously before considering any of these options and discuss them with a counselor for free by going to Credit.org.  If you have not had success with other methods and are expecting a refund on your federal income tax, it's possible to get a loan based on the anticipated refund. Contact a large tax preparation firm for a refund anticipation loan. These loans are no longer offered by banks.Refund anticipation loans use your anticipated tax return as collateral. They typically come with very high interests rates, in addition to other possible fees.RALs are typically available starting in January at the end of the fiscal year, up until April when taxes are due.If you file your taxes online through the e-file system, you can often get your refund almost as quickly as you can get funds through one of these loans.Consider carefully whether you really need one of these loans, as they take a substantial portion of your refund.  For example, it is common for a loan of this type to charge a $50 fee and up to 36% interest per year. Using this information, if you borrowed $2000 for 15 days using this type of loan, you would owe $80 in interest and fees.This places RAL's in the same group as other very high-rate loans.  You can use your your credit card at a bank to get a small loan that will be applied to your credit card bill.  If you have a credit card issued by a major corporation (such as Visa, Mastercard, Discover, or American Express), you should be able to take it into your local bank branch and ask for a cash advance, though these funds come at a much higher interest rate than your usual credit card transactions.Try to pay back the cash advance by your next statement. If you fail to do so, the interest will carry over to subsequent payments.  Be warned that these cash advances generally charge around 24% annual interest, along with a 5% fee.For example, if you take out an average-rate (24%) cash advance for $1,000 and pay it back over a year with $100 payments, you will end up paying about $190 in fees throughout the life of the loan., A final possibility if none of the previous methods have worked and you need some cash quickly is to get a payday loan. There are numerous businesses, both 'brick and mortar' and online that will offer you a loan against your next paycheck. These extremely high-rate secured loans should be used only as a last resort.  To get one of these loans, you'll need to provide the lender with a post-dated check, or with your account number and routing number. If you do not return to repay the loan on payday, or if you don't transfer the funds back to the lender electronically, the lender is entitled to deposit the check or withdraw funds online.  Because they have high default rates, most lenders put very high interest rates on these short-term loans. The average annual percentage rate on a payday loan is 390%.Avoid taking out one of these loans, but if you must, pay it back quickly, as the interest will quickly accumulate.  Beware of the payday loan trap. Many people who take out payday loans fail to pay them back. By doing so, they end up taking on even more debt. More than 60% of payday loan borrowers end up paying more in interest than they originally borrowed. This traps these lenders in an endless cycle of debt.For example, on a $500 payday loan, assuming 300% interest, a borrower can expect to pay $125 per month in interest alone. This means that at the end of the first payment period (usually two weeks), the borrower must repay the full amount of roughly $560 or be forced to accept even higher payments on the next cycle.  ","figure out if you have any other options. get a refund anticipation loan (ral). take out a cash advance. get a payday loan. "
"A heavy person might play sports and eat a balanced diet, while a thin person might thrive upon junk food and late-night internet browsing. People of any size may have a disability affecting their ability to exercise or eat certain food groups. You can't see someone's habits just by looking at their weight.;  , Look beyond 'fat is bad:' what is the real reasoning you want to push someone to make such drastic changes? Why do the particulars of their body matter so much to you?  You want to take on the role of saving them from themselves  You are physically disgusted by their weight, or by fat people in general  You are embarrassed to be seen with someone fat  You don't care about their weight; you just want them to be happy and treat themselves well  , If your friend is on the bigger side, they know. In fact, people probably won't stop telling them. Heavy people are at greater risk for mental health issues and low self-esteem, and reminding them how fat they are is not going to make it any better.  You are their friend, not a critic or a personal trainer.  Criticizing their body won't help them. It's hard to take good care of something you hate, so don't encourage them to hate their body.

"It will be much easier for you to stand up for yourself if you are well rested. Lack of sleep can make you irritable, slow to react, and easily confused. So make sure that you are getting plenty of rest each night.  Teenagers need between 9 and 9 ½ hours of sleep to be healthy. Make sure you go to bed at a time that allows you to get this much sleep. (Most teenagers only get about 7 hour of sleep each night.)Do things like taking a warm bath or shower, reading a book, or sipping some tea to get ready for bed.  Turn off your phone and other electronic devices so that you can sleep without alarms and alerts waking you up.  It will be hard for you to stand up to someone if you feel hungry, tired, or just generally bad because you aren’t eating right. Taking care of your body and eating right is one way to make sure you feel good.  Make sure you are eating enough fresh fruits and vegetables because they can give you energy.  Drink plenty of water and avoid drinks with a lot of sugar or caffeine.  Try to eat three to four meals a day and have small snacks in between. Make sure you are eating breakfast to start your day off right.  Doing something active can help you stand up for yourself by improving your self esteem, giving you more energy, and making you healthier.It can also help you release any tension or stress that you might be feeling because of the situation.  Join a team sport like basketball, soccer, or hockey so that you can spend time around positive people.  Try something like martial arts, yoga, Zumba, or a self-defense class.  Go for a walk, jog, hike, or swim to be active and give yourself time to clear your mind.  Being bullied or having trouble getting along with others can cause a lot of stress, which may make matters even worse. Learning healthy, productive ways to deal with stress can help in many ways — improving your health, your mindset, and may even help you stay calm in the face of conflict.  Try deep breathing to calm yourself in the moment or when you feel anxious or stressed out.  Make sure you are giving yourself enough time during the day to relax and do things you enjoy. Avoid over-scheduling yourself and that you have a few nights a week and time on the weekend to relax and just watch TV, play games, or do whatever you feel like.  Try meditation.  Remember that exercise is a great way to de-stress, too.  Sometimes people feel like they just don't fit in with their classmates.

Check the YMCA for sports or activity clubs.  Try taking art classes at community centers or studios.  Reach out to people at your place of worship.  Get involved in volunteering and meet others through service.

"Your boyfriend would expect you to write 'I love you' at the end of a letter or a text message, but he won't expect to see it written in the steam after his shower, in the hot sauce on his morning omelet, or on a blank page of his notebook that he sees when he's about to take notes for class. Finding a creative and unique place to write 'I love you' will make him think even more fondly of you when you're not there, and will make him feel more romantic because you've made a special effort to let him know that you care.  Just doing this once or twice a month can really show your boyfriend that you care. You don't have to overdo it.;  , This can be a CD that reminds him of 'your songs' or one that really takes his musical tastes into account and is a mix of things you actually think he likes. Don't recommend your favorite bands if you know they aren't his thing; but if you really know what he would like, then make him a mixed CD and pop it into his car's CD player when he's not looking. When he turns on the car, he'll get a pleasant surprise.  Make sure you know what music he listens to, what music he already owns, and what he likes before you go and do this.  Put together a scrapbook of all of your most meaningful memories. Put together photos of you together, tickets from your favorite concert, a menu from the restaurant where you first said 'I love you,' or notes that you wrote each other throughout the course of your relationship. This can make a great anniversary or birthday gift, or you can give him the book just because.  This book will make him see how far you've come in your relationship, and will make him appreciate you even more.  Who says Valentine's Day is only for February 14th? If you're both busy that day, or if you just want to be romantic on a random Wednesday, then you should plan an celebrating Valentine's Day on whatever day works for you two; you can use this time to shower each other with love and affection, dress up, and eat something delicious.  This fake Valentine's Day will be extra fun because you both will feel like you're in on a joke.  Little kids have an infinitive amount of wonder at the state of the world, along with a healthy dose of hope and optimism. So, take a day to just act like a kid with your boyfriend, and see how much your love for each other and the world grows when you do the silly things you loved to do as a kid. You two can go to a carnival, make balloon animals, finger paint, mud wrestle, or just do anything fun and silly that makes you feel more romantic and more alive.

"The first requirement to changing an aspect of your personality is to believe that you can change. If you don't have this conviction, then your personality will remain the same. No matter what circumstances you're in, believing that you can change is the single most important contributor to success in changing your personality.Most of us grew up believing that our characters or personalities were going to always be a certain way. Research now suggests that this isn't true.  If you don't believe you can change, think about why this might be the case. Consider what ways the aspects of your personality you don't care for might be serving you. If there are fears that are keeping you from believing that you can change, address the fears.  Review the 'Big Five' personality factors that psychologists agree make up the traits of a person's personality.You can use these as guidelines to begin to figure out what you'd like to change. Once you've identified the general trait you'd like to change, start to think of smaller, concrete ways to do so. Be as specific as you can about the change you'd like to make, and specifically how you'd like to make it.The Big Five are as follows:Openness to Experience: This includes your willingness to experiment, depth of emotions, intellectual curiosity, and tolerance for diversity.  Conscientiousness: Also known as your work ethic, the facets of this personality factor includes self-discipline, orderliness, your sense of competence, and your sense of responsibility.  Extraversion: If you are shy, you will want to consider improving on these traits, like assertiveness, warmth, gregariousness, and your activity level.  Agreeableness: Traits like sincerity, modesty, trust in others, sympathy, and altruism all fall under this factor.  Natural Reactions: Consider how emotionally reactive you are. Do you have intense reactions to minor events? You may want to work on a trait in this personality factor, like anxiety, hostility, sensitivity to stress, self-consciousness, and self-indulgence.  If you're not sure what you want to change, but only feel that you want to be different somehow, spend more time thinking about what's creating your discomfort.  If you're still not sure how to think about this, ask for help. People who might be helpful include: your parents, a good friend, a counselor, a therapist, a religious authority, or another trusted person. The important thing is to remember that you don't have to do this alone.  Before you throw yourself into cultivating a new trait, consider how it might help or hinder your life and whether or not it aligns with your values. If you're thinking about trying to become a demure, compliant person, but your values include standing up and shouting when you see injustice or wrongdoing, then your new personality trait is going to clash with your values and may cause some confusion and discomfort. You may want to rethink traits that don't align with your values., The first thing to notice is how you currently identify with that aspect of your personality. Most people form their identities around their personality traits. For example, if you are quick to react with anger, you might feel nervous about letting go of that defensive aspect of your personality. You might fear that people will think you or weak or can take advantage of you.Having fear about making a change in your personality is natural! It's important to acknowledge the fear, so that you can set it aside.  Make a plan to handle the ambivalence you might feel around making this change in your personality. Using positive affirmations, relaxation techniques, and accountability partners are all ways that people might handle any fears or reservations about making changes in who they are.  Part of believing that you can change is visualizing yourself in a new life, with a new way of being. For instance, if you believe you can be an introvert, visualize yourself gaining energy from spending time alone. Develop the belief that a quiet night at home feeds your soul. Imagine yourself happily engaged in your favorite solitary activities.Being willing to learn new traits means letting go of other ideas you may have once had about yourself. If you're learning to be happy alone, for instance, notice every time you start to feel like a social misfit for being by yourself. Learn to laugh at yourself for these slip-ups.  Notice other people who share personality traits that you'd like to cultivate for yourself, and imitate these people in your daily life.  A role model is someone who exemplifies the kind of life, or lifestyle, you'd like to create for yourself. As you visualize yourself in the new personality, it can help to have others around you who already seem to demonstrate these qualities or characteristics.For example, if you're trying to become a warmer person, notice other people who appear warm and happy when helping others. What are these people like, and what do they do? You can learn a lot by imitating them.  It may help you persevere in changing your life if you remember that you, too, are a role model for others. Are you living the life you want others to see and imitate? Will the changes that you're making create the kind of life you're proud of?  , The more often you are able to practice your new personality trait, the more generalized it will become. Practicing your new personality in multiple settings, at all different times of day and night, is necessary for the new trait to feel natural.Be alert for opportunities to act in the new way, rather than in your old way. For example, if you're practicing being spontaneous rather than cautious, invite a new friend to go roller-skating. Do things that you don't expect to do.  If at first it feels artificial to act in this new way, don't be surprised. As the old adage goes, 'Fake it, until you make it!'  , An affirmation is a positive statement regarding what you believe, or what you would like to believe. If you want to change who you are, you'll likely have to change the beliefs you have about yourself and your limitations. These negative beliefs are limiting beliefs. Limiting beliefs can be replaced with positive beliefs, or affirmations.For example, if you believe that you're the kind of person who's easily overwhelmed, exchange that belief for the idea that you have great stamina.  Write your own affirmation on an index card, and post it where you will see it multiple times per day. Whenever you see it, read it to yourself aloud. Gradually, this will start to become part of your conscious belief about yourself.  Personality change coaching or counseling can help you identify which traits you want to change, and how to accomplish those changes.You can discuss your values and your vision of your ideal self, and a counselor can teach you techniques, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy, or solution focused therapy, to help you reach your goals.  ","believe that it's possible to change. select an aspect of your personality to change. consider the positive and problematic aspects of new traits. notice your feelings about changing. visualize yourself in the new personality. identify new role models. practice your new personality trait. try using affirmations. seek coaching.

"Check them out and read them. If you can, find out your professor's favorite authors, especially those that have influenced your professor's writing.;  , Is the tone serious and subdued? Rough and harsh? Dramatic and elegant? See if you can emulate the style in a few sentences of your own.  Does a lot of action take place in a short time, or is much of the writing given over to detailed description? Most writers emphasize either action, description or dialogue. You'll want to know which you should favor in your writing for this class.  They can be your most helpful resource. Ask them what the professor is looking for and they'll give you a good blunt answer. Two students of a screenwriting professor at a state university helped several other students succeed in his class with one simple tip: The professor liked scripts with a good dose of profanity in them; although he didn't realize it, this was what he meant when he said he wanted the dialogue to be 'natural.' A simple sprinkling of rudeness and rough language moved one student up from a C to an A.  Your professor will mention some of his or her pet peeves about writing style. The most common pet peeves are writing in the passive voice and using adverbs. (Although all good writers use these sometimes, you are a mere undergraduate and haven't earned your license to do so.) Learn what these are and avoid them at all times. A good resource is a tiny, easy-to-read guide called The Elements of Style (see below).  Again, choose something similar to what your professor favors. If he or she writes about oppressed characters mired in futile struggles, don't make your story about a golden hero who clears every hurdle with brilliant ease. It will annoy your instructor and your writing will be judged as 'unrealistic.' Conversely, if your instructor loves stories about spiritual hope, don't let your dark, brooding side come out too much in your writing.  A foreign country is always good.  It's okay to dramatize their personalities a little. No one wants to read a story full of characters that are no more interesting than their own friends and family.  In the beginning, you might make one of your characters want something that's out of reach. In the middle, you'll create a conflict that prevents the character from getting what he wants, and in the end, you will resolve the conflict (either with success or failure).  Most creative writing classes involve some kind of peer critique process. Most of your classmates will either deliver vague criticism of everything you write no matter how good it is, or vague praise of everything you write no matter how bad it is. This is because most aspiring young creative writers don't like to read amateur fiction nearly as much as they like to write it. They may not have taken more than a minute or two to read your story. Don't take it personally, and be the better person who gives specific helpful comments.  Make sure it's free of spelling, grammar and usage errors. Here is where the peer critiques can be useful, provided that your classmates have reference materials and will double-check whether their corrections were correct.  , If you didn't get an A, find out who did. Take careful note of the professor's feedback, and try again.  ","find out who the professor is for your creative writing class, and find out what creative works he or she has had published recently. pay particular attention to your professor's preferred style. as you read through the chapters, notice how the plot develops. find as many people as you can who have taken a class from this professor. listen closely in the first few class periods. think of a theme before you create your story. choose an interesting setting. create interesting characters. create a story with a beginning, middle and end. accept constructive criticism. revise your story into a final draft. turn your story in on time. , keep trying.

"One reason that you might wake up with a stomach ache is that you are thirsty. Dehydration can cause a stomach ache and since you have just gone all night without water, you may be slightly dehydrated. Pour yourself a glass of water and drink it slowly. You don't want to drink it too fast and shock your empty stomach.  You can also add lemon to it as well. It can help calm any stomach irritation caused by the dehydration.  You can also try to drink juice or a sports drink to help replenish any nutrients or electrolytes that you might be missing., If you wake up with pains in your stomach, you may need something to calm your stomach down. Ginger, whether it is in tea, raw, or in ginger ale, can help calm your stomach and make it feel better. It promotes the release of enzymes that help neutralize stomach acid and contains phenols that relax the stomach muscles and irritated tissues. One of the best ways to get pure ginger is by making a homemade ginger tea.  To make the tea, start with 2 inch piece of ginger root and water. Peel and cut the ginger root into small pieces, then crush the pieces into even smaller bits. Boil 2-3 cups of water and add the ginger once it's boiling. Let it boil for 3-5 minutes. Remove it from heat. You can strain the ginger out when they pour it into a mug if you want or you can leave it in and drink it along with the tea. You can also drizzle some honey in it to make it sweeter.  You can simply eat ginger if you prefer that to drinking the homemade tea., Chamomile tea is a great way to soothe your stomach. The chamomile in the tea helps reduce inflammation, which can help relax the muscles in your stomach that are contributing to the ache. If you are not a fan of chamomile, you can brew most herbal teas to help with stomach issues.  Steer clear of peppermint tea. It ca relax certain parts of your esophageal sphincter, which leads to heartburn and acid reflux., Unlike normal water, coconut water contains electrolytes and natural nutrients that can help alleviate stomach pain. The water contains natural sugars that will give you calories to give you energy as well as potassium and vitamin C.  Make sure you get 100% pure coconut water.You don't want any of the artificial ingredients that may make your stomach ache even worse.  Baking soda is great for a stomach ache because it helps neutralize stomach acid, which causes pain. Many over the counter medications contain baking soda, but you can make your own home solution to ease your stomach pain. Add a tablespoon of baking soda to 1 cup of water. Stir it well and then drink it.  You can warm the water if your want, but it isn't necessary., Unlike other kinds of vinegar, apple cider vinegar is rich in nutrients that can help alleviate your stomach ache in the morning. It also has helpful bacteria and enzymes that will alleviate digestive disruption, help indigestion, and reduce cramps.  Mix apple cider vinegar with water and honey and stir. Drink it all to help alleviate your stomach ache.  ","drink water. make ginger tea. brew chamomile tea. try coconut water. mix a baking soda solution. make an apple cider vinegar drink. "
"Before you choose an automated toy, take some time to consider what types of toys your cat currently enjoys. For example, if your cat likes chasing a laser pointer, you might consider an automated laser toy. If your cat likes pouncing on a plush mouse, you might buy an automated mouse toy.  If your cat likes leaping, consider a hanging toy.  If your cat likes running, consider a toy that moves across the floor.;  , Make sure you choose a cat toy that is made of materials that are safe for cats. For example, you should not buy a toy that is made of small objects like beads, beans, or nutshells. A cat can easily choke on or consume these materials, quickly turning playtime into a visit to the vet., Before you buy a toy, inspect its integrity and construction. Cat toys should be free from loose parts, sharp edges, and metal. If you notice a component of the toy that could be potentially dangerous for your cat, do not purchase the toy.  ","think about what your cat enjoys. opt for safe materials. inspect the toy carefully before purchasing. "
"A sniper must often wait a while until the enemy shows up or until there is a good chance of easy engagement.;  , Most Airsoft Snipers upgrade their sniper rifles as most of the 'stock' (just bought ones) are often just as powerful as some Assault Rifles.  0.20g BBs are most popular for all Airsofters but Airsoft Snipers often choose 0.25g or 0.30g BBs for better accuracy. Make sure they are well made to prevent damage to your gun.  Scope is very useful in ranges and zooming in helps you to aim. I would recommend a scope with at least 4x zoom.  This helps you to prevent being seen by the enemy.  It is useful as most professionally organized Airsoft teams use common tactics, which sometimes (depends on situation you are in) can be easily overtaken by that one or more snipers. Also don't forget that you are not to see frontline engagements but to support your team from a distance so make sure you stick to it.  Your own garden is good one for practice. Get to know your rifle's capabilities and practice more until your shooting accuracy gradually improves.  Snipers don't move as much as most Airsofters but if they do then they require much more speed and must be fitter. This is caused by the fact that once a sniper is seen by the enemy they need to either engage or run to cover.  Sometimes you might see only one or two opponents but when you hit them then you might get a whole team after you. Also if the enemy team is well organized and has a squad leader then he or she should be your primary target. This will make confusing within your opponents and strike fear within their hearts.  Watch if there is anything that you can use to hide (such as bushes) and look out for any opponents. The most dangerous opponents are enemy snipers so keep an eye for them!  , Some snipers often just stand around and get shot easily. Walk slowly around, keeping an eye on everything, keep finger on the trigger, keep heart rate low and breathe slowly.  Instead of moving loud around the battlefield move slowly but quietly.  A successful sniper is the one that enemy is really afraid of.

"Buying local can help curb animal cruelty. Animals raised on local farms were likely subjected to more ethical conditions than animals on factory farms. If you can find a local farmer's market or grocery store, make that your first option when it comes to grocery shopping.  Locally raised meat is usually free from the antibiotics and growth hormones animals are force fed at factories. Animals raised on an organic diet are significantly healthier than factory raised animals.In factory farms, animals are kept in tight pens and cannot move more than a few feet. Local farms usually allow animals to be free range, meaning they can spend more time outside and are not confined to pens.When you buy meat, eggs, or cheese from a local farm, your money goes straight to supporting that farm. At a grocery store, you are more likely to be supporting a multinational food conglomerate than individual farmers. Allowing these farms the money they need to sustain themselves gives happy homes to a variety of animals., If farmer's markets aren't available in your area, try to find a grocery store that supports local markets and adheres to ethical guidelines when it comes to the buying and selling of meat.  Whole Foods, one of the biggest grocery shopping chains, buys from local markets and only stock meat products purchased from farmers that meat strict standards for animal welfare.Earth Fare, similar to Whole Foods, follows strict ethical standards when it comes to the animal products bought and sold.If you look around, you might find a local grocery store in your area that buys local.  Many people believe the best way to curb animals cruelty is by not eating meat or by not eating animals products at all. This is called vegetarianism/veganism and if you are dedicated to the cause it's something you can consider.  Vegetarians do not eat meat, fish, and poultry. It's possible to meet all nutritional needs while maintaining a vegetarian diet.  Vegetarians find alternative sources of protein in beans, lentils, tofu, nuts, seeds, tempeh, and peas.  Vegans, in addition to not eating meat, do not eat anything with animal byproducts. This includes dairy and honey. Vegans can easily meet protein requirements as almost all foods have some protein. Chickpeas, tofu, peas, peanut butter, almonds, and other nuts are great sources of protein on a vegan diet.The vitamin B12, often found in meats and other animal-based products, is very important to maintain a healthy diet. Vegetarians and vegans can find B12 in soy meats, some cereals, soy milk, and nutritional yeast. You can also talk to your doctor about B12 supplements., You don't always know what you're getting eating out, and by cooking your own meals at home you can assure yourself you're eating ethically.  Use food you bought locally, or food that contains no hidden animals products.  If you eat meat, buy locally raised grass-fed meat from local markets.  By making meals at home, you can make sure the products you're using are cruelty free. Even when eating vegetarian options at restaurants, you never know what hidden animals products could be used in the food.  In addition to reducing animal cruelty, eating at home is also better for your health as your food is generally lower in calories and less stocked with hidden sugars and fats.  ","buy from local farmer's markets. shop from ethical grocery stores. go vegetarian or vegan. make your meals at home. "

"People tend to use Western style riding for rodeos and ranching and it is more common in the U.S. than in other countries, so you might have a harder time accessing Western equipment if you live somewhere that favors English style.  One nice thing about the Western saddle is that it has the horn, where you can grip onto if you're on an experienced rider.  If this is the first time you're using this bit on this particular horse you definitely want to make sure that you're using the proper sized bridle. If it's the wrong size it will make the horse uncomfortable.Bridles comes in three sizes: pony, cob or Arabian, and full. Measure your horse’s head from the center of his poll to the corner of his mouth, and compare this measurement to the crown and cheek piece of the bridle.  If the bit is too small it can pinch the horse’s mouth.  If the bit is too big it will slide around in the horse’s mouth.  A horse can sense your fear and this will make them nervous. Also, remember that it can be nerve-wracking for a horse to have someone putting something metallic in their mouth.  You need to make sure that your horse is secured. This means anticipating the moment when they are halter-free but you haven't yet buckle the bridle. You have to be able to control and keep hold of your horse.  For a tie station, hold the bridle so that the front of the brow band faces forward (away from the horse). Drape the reins over their neck. Drop your left rein over the horse's neck so that it falls on the right. Drop the right rein so that it falls on the left. Allow the bridle to slip back on your arm. Lift the crown of the halter over the horse's ears and slip the halter's nose band down, off their face. Bring the crown up and lay it behind their ears. Refasten their halter so it hands around the horse's neck.  If you don't have a tie station use the bridle reins to maintain hold of your horse. For split reins, tie them together and lift the reins over the horse's head, setting them just behind their ears. Lift the halter's crown over the horse's ears and slip the halter nose band off your horse's face.  You can offer them a piece of apple or sugar cube to make them their head. Put your hand right below their nose with the treat in it. When they drop their head that's when you'll put the bit in.  Make sure you’re grasping the crown of the bridle in your right hand. Angle in line with your horse’s left eye and right ear.  Hold the bit low where you’ve been holding the treats. Gently set it against your horse’s teeth as close to where her top teeth meet her lower teeth as possible. Hold your sugar cube against the bit.  Make sure you put the bit in before you put the bridle’s crown over their ears.  Holding the crown of the bridle up in order to slip it on before you put the bit in their mouth.  Hold the bridle so that the two sides are a good distance apart, with the crown up and the throatlatch straps hanging free and not tangled in any other straps.  You want to be careful that you don't crush your horse's ears. Lift the crown over your horse's left ear as you slip the crown to the poll. Gently slip the horse's right ear in front of the crown as well. Also gently push the horse's ears forward rather than backward.  If the bridle has earloops rather than a brow band, position these around your horse’s ears now.  Always make sure that you reward your horse for their good behavior. This will encourage them to be good about accepting the bit and the bridle.  Sugar also encourages them to play with the bit, so sugar cubes are a really good treat to have on hand for bridling.  , Remember that the throatlatch isn't there to hold the bridle in place. It operates as an extra precaution against the bridle coming off. This means that the throatlatch needs to be loose enough to maintain slack, even if the horse drops their head.  Make sure you can fit your entire hand between the throatlatch and the horse, even when their head is bent towards their neck.  The brow band should be smooth and in the correct position. This means it won't be pinching your horse's ears or head. Check that the bit sits evenly in your horse's mouth. There should be two wrinkles on either corner of your horse's mouth. Too fewer and you need to shorten the cheek straps.  Make sure it sits evenly on your horse’s head. If you do have to adjust the cheek strap check that the rest of the headstall is still even.  Buckle curb chain or chin strap if that isn’t fixed.  This is when you should check the length of your reins. The need to be long enough that you can take up contact with your horse's mouth.  Lead them on their left, at their cheek. Hold the reins in your right hand about six inches below the bit. Keep the bight in your left hand. Always hold about six inches below the bit.  Keep the slack from the reins in your left hand.  ","pick western style riding for more informal riding. check that you have the correct bridle size. make sure that both you and the horse are calm. secure your horse. have your horse drop their head. slip the bit into your horse’s mouth with the treat. keep pressure on the crown while slipping it over their ears. give your horse a treat for being good. remove the halter once the main part of the bridle is on the horse. , buckle the throatlatch. check the bridle's fit. gather your reins in your right hand.

"This is a color-coded table that organizes all the known elements by atomic structure. Each element has a 1, 2, or 3-letter abbreviation and is listed along with its atomic weight and atomic number.Periodic tables can easily be found in chemistry books and online.;  , The elements are ordered by atomic number and separated into three main groups: metals, non-metals, and metalloids (semi-metals). They are further grouped into families including alkali metals, halogens, and noble gases.Every column of the table is called a group and every row is called a period.  If you know the details of your element, such as what group or period it is in, it will be easier to locate.  If you don’t know anything about the element in question, just search the table for its symbol until you find it.  The atomic number appears in the upper left-hand corner, above the element symbol in the square. The atomic number defines the number of protons present in that particular element.Protons are the particles in an element that provide a positive charge. Because electrons are negatively charged, when an element is in its neutral state, it will have the same number of protons as electrons.  For instance, boron (B) has an atomic number of 5, meaning that it has 5 protons and 5 electrons.

"These starters are less expensive and inexpensive to have installed.  Multiple-button car starters start your SUV and can lock and unlock doors. Some multiple-button starters are equipped to turn on window defrosters and seat warmers. These are more expensive than single-button starters and are more prone to technical problems, but provide a higher level of convenience.;  ,  Mechanics recommend getting a remote automobile starter with a warranty that will last as long as you expect to own your SUV. Buy a car starter with a warranty package that protects against faulty installation or electrical malfunctions.  The specialists that sell you your starter are well-trained in the installation process. There will be an additional fee for installation, but you can be assured that the starter will be installed properly.  Remote starters vary in transmission range. Inexpensive single-button starters typically have a range of 100 (30 m), while more intricate starters can have a range of up to 1,000 feet (300 m). Consider where you typically park your SUV at home, work and when shopping to determine what range will work best for you.  A hood safety switch is an optional safety feature that can be installed with most remote car starters. It prevents the starter from starting your SUV when the vehicle's hood is up.  Many car specialists opt not to install the hood safety switch unless specifically requested. Be sure to ask about this feature when you're having your starter installed.  Starters with engine speed detection can read a car's engine RPMs, or revolutions per minute. This will allow your starter to detect if the SUV fails to start when prompted due to cold weather or engine malfunction.

"This should be listed in your loan contract or investment documents. Interest rates may also compound quarterly (4 times per year), monthly, or weekly. If your compounding rate is anything other than annually, you should go to annualizing a compounding interest rate to calculate your rate.  Credit cards, for example, may advertise monthly interest rates, like 1 or 2 percent, but they have to show borrowers the annualized rate when they sign credit contracts. This will be listed as the annual percentage rate, or APR, on the contract.;  , This is the amount of interest earned or paid each period. Again, this can be weekly, monthly, or quarterly. For example, you might pay 1 percent per month in credit card interest. This is your period interest rate.For the purposes of calculating the annualized rate, you will have to know your period interest rate expressed as a decimal. You can find this value by dividing the stated period interest rate by 100.  For example, 1 percent would be 1/100, or 0.01.  , This is the number of interest periods there are in one year. For a stated monthly interest rate, there would be 12 period in a year. Similarly, a loan or investment using a weekly interest rate would have 52 periods in a year and one with a quarterly rate would have 4.  Alternately, a bond payment may make semiannual interest payments. This would be 2 payment period per year., The annualized percentage rate can be calculated using the following formula: n∗r{\displaystyle n*r}. In the formula, n represents the number of periods in the year and r represents the period interest rate.  For example if you were quoted a rate of 1 percent per month (r=0.01, n=12), compounded annually, your annualized interest rate is 12∗0.01=0.12{\displaystyle 12*0.01=0.12} (or 12%).  This calculation should be used if the rate compounds annually, rather than quarterly, monthly, or some other frequency.  ","determine whether or not your interest rate compounds annually. find out the period interest rate. determine the number of periods in a given year. calculate the annualized percentage rate. "
"The first step to understanding the meaning of lyrics is actually understanding them. Reading along will give you a much more complete picture of the words and eliminate misunderstandings. If you're trying to really dive into a song, you'll need the lyrics on hand to make sense of it. What does the title mean? What do you think the song is about? More often than not, reading the lyrics will give you guidance.Adele's hit 'Hello' is about heartbreak and sadness. But the title points to something more: the desire and need to reach out to our fellow human beings.  Look up any words or references that don't make sense. This is often the key to making a strange song suddenly clear. Charles Mingus's 'Fables of Faubus,' for example, only makes sense if you know that Orval Faubus was a racist Arkansas governor.;  , You cannot understand the lyrics fully if you don't listen to them against the music. Instrumentals are how mood is set and how songwriters tell their stories, and cannot be forgotten. Luckily, it is almost all subjective. Ask yourself -- what kind of music would you put behind these words? Why would an artist choose the music they did for background?Beyonce's 'Love on Top' features a series of key changes that bring her voice higher and higher. The obvious, but important, parallel is that the love she feels is elevating her into the sky.  The Smiths are famous for using bouncy, happy instruments under dark, melancholic lyrics. Perhaps this suggests that there is sadness under the surface of even the happiest people, perhaps not -- it is your call.  Check out covers of your favorite songs to see how different artists approach the same words. Popular songs like 'A Change is Gonna Come' can have wildly different 'meanings' depending on the music behind the lyrics.  The words themselves are important, but the way they are delivered is just as crucial. Where does the singer change up the melody, hit a high note, growl out the words, or put a subtle pause? When you listen to the song, which phrases naturally stick in your brain? These are often the lines that hold the most clues about the songs importance.Even a howl or grunt can give lyrics new meaning, like Marvin Gaye's 'Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler).' When he hits that high note you feel every word of pain in the song in a new light.  Leonard Cohen puts all of 'Chelsea Hotel No.2' into perspective with a quick, surprising internal rhyme. The song sounds like a love song, up until 'I never suggest that I love you the best' shows that it is actually about fleeting memory.  Think of the singer has a character, not the specific person. Tom Waits, for example, inhabits all sorts of druggies, gamblers, drivers, and con-men. When you realize he is playing characters, all with unique stories, he makes much more sense.  Many songs are personal, hiding or hinting at other events without explaining them. Knowing this context can suddenly make the lyrics all snap into place. If you love a song or album, take some time to research how it came about to see if there is anything you never knew.Eric Clapton's 'Tears in Heaven,' for example, is a poignant song. But it becomes devastating when you learn it is about his son who died young.  Kanye West's album 'My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy' is already powerful, but the knowledge that it was written in the wake of his mother's death gives it added depth.  This is a technique of many advanced songwriters, and knowing it can help you understand even odd or oblique lyrics. A turn is when the lyrics suddenly shift directions, and this shift is often where people get confused. Realize, however, that this shift is often the point of the song -- to show you how things change or feel misplaced. When reading these lyrics, it is most important to ask two questions: 'how is the end of the song different from the beginning, and how did we get there?Bob Dylan's 'A Simple Twist of Fate,' is in the third person for every verse until the last one. Suddenly, he starts with 'I.' A impressionistic, cute little song becomes extremely personal, and it is clear Dylan was actually hiding his own sadness in someone else's story.  Common's 'Testify' is a mob ballad with a twist at the end -- the grieving wife is actually the mastermind. Suddenly, the refrain 'please let me testify' sounds much more sinister.  Enter into the conversation by searching what other people think of the lyrics. Sites like RapGenius (which is not exclusively for rap) offer annotated lyrics, giving you a chance to see references or interpretations that you might have missed. Joining into conversation with others is the best way to quickly increase your understanding and open your mind to new interpretations.  Once a work of art is created you have just as much of a right to 'understand it' as anyone else. Your own thoughts and opinions matter because no one can say what a song means to you. While there are certainly some interpretations that fit closer to the songwriter's intent than others, you should feel free to think about your personal interpretation.  ","look up the lyrics and follow along. ask yourself how the lyrics interact with the music. listen for places the vocalist puts emphasis to find crucial lines. search online for outside context about the track. note where the song 'turns' or changes on a dime. check out discussions or writing on music to gain a greater appreciation. trust your own interpretation of the lyrics.

"Gold itself can be boiled with no problems. However, boiling delicate gemstones (like opals, pearls, coral, and moonstones) can cause them to crack or become damaged - especially if the jewelry is cold before boiling. Boiling is also a bad idea for jewelry with glued-in gemstones, as it can loosen the glue. However, if you're looking to clean heavily-soiled jewelry made entirely out of gold or gold jewelry that contains 'strong' gemstones (like diamonds), boiling is a great choice.  You don't need to boil much water - just enough to submerge all of the jewelry in. As you're waiting for the water to boil, set your gold jewelry in a sturdy bowl or another vessel that won't be damaged by boiling water. Pyrex or metal cooking bowls/dishes are good choices.  Arrange jewelry in the dish or bowl so that no piece of jewelry is covering up another piece - water should be able to reach every piece of jewelry.  Be very careful not to spill or splash by pouring too rapidly - boiling water can cause serious burns. When all of the jewelry is completely submerged, you've added enough water.  When you can comfortably put your hands in the water, you can remove the jewelry. Follow a good boiling by scrubbing each piece of jewelry with a soft brush, then dabbing it dry with a soft towel and allowing it to sit and air-dry completely.  Don't be afraid if the water appears dirty - this is good! As boiling water loosens the dirt, wax, grime, etc. that's built up on your jewelry, it may float to the surface of the water. The dirtier your water looks, the more dirt you've removed from your jewelry!  ","know when boiling is appropriate. bring water to a boil. carefully pour the water over your jewelry. wait for the water to cool. "
"Preheat the oven to 160ºC (320ºF) and place a rack in the center position.;  , Take 115g (½ cup) salted butter on the cool side of room temperature, workable but not melting. Cut it into small chunks and add to a mixing bowl.Most of the flavor of shortbread comes from butter, so using a fresh, high-quality product can make a big difference. The traditional choice is a European-style butter, which has a little more fat than American-style.If you only have unsalted butter, just add a pinch of salt to the recipe. It won't mix in quite as well since shortbread dough is so dry, but it's not a major problem., The recipe calls for 55g (¼ cup) sugar, but which type you use depends on your preferred texture. The most popular choices are caster sugar, for a sandy texture, or icing sugar, for a smooth, melt-in-your-mouth shortbread.Whichever you choose, add the sugar gradually as you beat it into the butter, until light and fluffy.  This takes about three minutes with an electric mixer's paddle attachment on low speed, or a bit longer by hand.In the U.S. and some other countries, caster sugar is called 'superfine', and icing sugar is 'powdered' or 'confectioner's.'  You may use granulated sugar, but the recipe sometimes ends up a little gritty.  Sift 130g (1 cup) plain flour and 40g (¼ cup) rice flour together to remove all lumps. Mix this into the butter mixture just long enough for it to form a soft, crack-free dough.If this takes more than six or seven minutes, slowly dribble in water, but no more than 15 mL / 1 tbsp.Electric mixers and food processors can overwork the dough, making it tough. If you use one, keep it on low and finish it by hand.The warmth of your hands helps bind the dough together.  Rice flour (also sold as ground rice or rice powder) encourages the signature sandy texture. In a pinch, the shortbread should still turn out fine if you replace it with additional ordinary flour., Let the paper hang over the edges so you can easily remove the shortbread. A single batch of this recipe should fit a 15cm (6 inch) pan.This baking method makes a thick circle of shortbread with a soft center.You can use a special shortbread mold instead to make shortbread with a patterned surface. If you do, dust the mold with icing sugar and place it in the fridge., Press the dough into the pan and pat it flat, minimizing the handling time. If you'd like a smoother surface, cover the dough with plastic wrap and roll over it gently with a pastry roller or a lightweight jar., Cover the pan in plastic wrap and put it in the fridge for fifteen minutes (or even a full hour, if you're a perfectionist).This will improve the texture of the shortbread.  Poke the top of the shortbread with a fork, outlining eight or sixteen wedge-shaped slices on the surface. Poke the surface of each slice in several places as well. Besides looking decorative, these holes allow steam to escape, preventing cracking or bubbling.This wedge shape is a traditional presentation for shortbread, called 'petticoat tails.', The shortbread is ready at the very first sign of golden brown at the edge, or even just before. It will take longer to bake in a smaller pan, since the dough is thicker.  Let cool for a few minutes, then transfer out of the pan using parchment paper. Cut into slices while still warm, using a knife or pizza roller. Place slices onto a cooling rack to cool to room temperature, then serve or refrigerate in an airtight container.  Optionally, sprinkle with extra sugar.  Form the dough into a log with your hands, with minimal handling. You'll be slicing this log into rounds, so estimate the size of biscuit you'd like to make.  If your hands are warm, it's best to avoid further handling of the dough. Instead, roll the dough onto parchment paper and cut out rounds with cookie cutters. Dust the rolling pin with icing sugar instead of flour, if you have it., Cover the dough in plastic wrap and place in the fridge. Let chill for at least fifteen minutes, preferably 30 to 60, in order to prevent spreading in the oven., The thickness can be anywhere from 5mm (1/5') for crisp biscuits, to 12mm (nearly 1/2') for chewy, soft-in-the-center rounds.  Poke a fork once or twice into the top of each round. This lets steam escape through the holes instead of bubbling or breaking the shortbread.  Place the rounds on a lined baking tray. Check on them around the 12 minute mark, especially if the round are thin. They are ready when set but still pale, or when pale golden if you prefer them crisp. Remove them immediately if they look brown, since the underside cooks faster than the top.  Transfer to a wire rack and let cool. Sprinkle in sugar before eating for a sweeter, sparkling biscuit.  Pack leftovers in an airtight tub and eat within a couple weeks.

"There are two main types of PAS and both are driven hydraulically. All power steering systems operate by a pump with a pulley attached. They are belt driven. Pumps will have a fluid reservoir attached, where fluid is checked and added. Hydraulic hoses feed fluid to the steering mechanism that turns the vehicle’s wheels. There are two hoses leading from the pump to the steering box (or rack). One hose is under extreme pressure when the vehicle’s engine is running and the other is a low-pressure return line.  Hydraulic fluid is hazardous and can cause serious skin and eye injuries. Use care when handling and always use hand and eye protection.;  , There are two main types of power steering systems used in automotive vehicles. Modern cars now use a more advanced design called “Rack and Pinion” power steering. This design is identified by a long rack of “gear teeth” and a pinion gear at the end of the steering shaft.  The assembly is shrouded by a steel cylinder that contains the hydraulic fluid and lines and is located directly under the vehicle, near the transmission bell housing.  All front-wheel-drive cars, most small trucks and some SUV’s use this design today.  When manufacturers introduced power assisted steering, the original design was a hydraulically assisted gearbox called a recirculation ball. Identify this steering type by looking for a steel block with hydraulic lines attached.  The gearbox will be located at the end of the steering shaft and connected to the steering linkage (pitman arm, center link and tie-rod ends), under the front of the vehicle.  This design is still used today, mostly in trucks and heavy equipment.  Whether the vehicle has rack and pinion or a gear box, hydraulic fluid leaks are common. Both system types develop leaks over time and are addressed much the same way. Fluid leaks are most common at each hose end or along the hose itself. Pumps can develop leaks at the front seal or between the reservoir and pump.  Most leaks can be identified by observing the leak’s path back to its origin.  Such leaks can be found by adding fluorescent dye to the reservoir and using a black light to easily identify problem areas. These single-use test kits contain fluorescent dye, a black-light flashlight and visually enhanced safety glasses. To use the kit:  The fluorescent dye is added to the fluid reservoir and circulated throughout the system. When the dye leaks out of the problem area, the black light causes the dye to glow brightly, making it easy to identify.  Leak detection kits can be purchased from most auto part stores. Power steering test kits are most helpful when dealing with multiple leaks or when clear visibility is an issue.  ","take a look at your power steering to figure out what you’re working with. check to see if you have “rack and pinion” power steering. determine if you have an older power steering system by looking for the gearbox. check for leaks. use a fluorescent dye kit to locate hard-to-identify leaks.

"There are a number of hands-on methods that you can use to encourage – and teach – your baby in the motions of rolling over. You can try these on their own or in addition to play. One is to guide your baby in lifting and crossing the legs.First, lay your baby on the back on the tummy-time blanket and gently lift one leg. While holding the other leg down, move the raised leg in slow circles. Switch legs and do it again.  Next, with your baby still on his or her back, gently raise one leg again, cross it over the other, and roll the child in one movement onto the tummy.  Babies are hardwired at birth to keep their bodies aligned and only start to move by “segment” at around 4 to 5 months. This exercise is encouraging the movement your baby needs to roll over at the hips., This method is easy to do. It’s also something that you can incorporate into your daily routines like changing and putting your baby down to rest. So, you can practice this move many times per day.All you need to do is sit your baby on the bottom and roll her onto the side when laying her down. Babies, as said, are hardwired to keep their bodies aligned and will try to keep their heads over the rest of their body.  Just reverse the motions when you pick your baby up again. This will help your baby strengthen the muscles in the sides of the neck muscles and also get used to pushing against the floor on the way down.  One final method is to guide and encourage your baby through rolling over with the gentle aid of gravity. For this, you’ll need a raised surface on a very slight incline. Be careful and make sure that the surface is soft, not too high, and not too steep.Take a surface like a small mattress and place it on the ground. To get the proper incline, place a small pillow under one end of the mattress.  Start from the top and (very gently) help your baby roll over. Repeat this two or three times down the incline and then, once you’ve reached the bottom, do it from the top and roll her on the other side of her body.  In all cases, keep smiling, talking, encouraging, and interacting with your baby while you help the child turn over.  ","help your baby lift and cross his or her legs. roll your baby’s weight to the side when putting her down. roll your baby gently down an incline. "
"The first type of medical treatment that doctors often prescribe for plaque psoriasis is a medicated cream. These are applied directly to areas of inflammation. These creams often contain steroids, which help to minimize skin cell growth and reduce inflammation.Reducing skin growth in areas with plaque psoriasis is important for treatment because the scaling of the skin is due to the overgrowth of cells in that area.  Reducing inflammation will minimize the redness and will reduce itching and pain in the area as well.  If you experience scalp psoriasis, ask your doctor about a medicated steroid solution. These are typically thinner and more watery than lotions and creams, and are thus more easily absorbed by the scalp.;  , Light therapy can help to treat severe plaque psoriasis by exposing the skin to ultraviolet light on a regular basis. In some cases, your doctor will even prescribe a medication, psoralen, which, when taken in combination with light therapy, increases its effectiveness. The use of ultraviolet light slows the growth of plaque psoriasis skin cells, minimizing scaling and redness.Light therapy is done in a doctor's office or with a UVB light unit at home.  The key to light therapy is doing it consistently. Whether you do it at home or in a doctor's office, it needs to be done daily for maximum effect.  Using tanning beds does not provide the same benefit to plaque psoriasis. Instead of the therapeutic use of UVB light, tanning beds mostly emit UVA light. Additionally, tanning beds increase the likelihood of getting skin cancer.  Systemic therapy can be given orally, by injection, or by infusion, depending on what specific medication your doctor prescribes. In many cases, systemic therapy won't be used unless other treatments don't minimize the plaque psoriasis. However, if you have severe plaque psoriasis, your dermatologist will likely recommend this treatment in addition to other treatments.  Some medications that may be prescribed include: Methotrexate, Retinoids, Cyclosporine, and Biologic response modifiers., Your dermatologist may prescribe a traditional systemic therapy or a biologic therapy. Unlike traditional systemic therapies, which treat the entire immune system, biologic therapies target specific areas of the immune system. In the case of treatment for plaque psoriasis, biologic treatments block cells and proteins that are central to the development of psoriasis.Biologic drugs are either injected or administered intravenously.  You cannot take biologic drugs if you have an active infection or if your immune system is severely compromised.  ","use topical creams. start light therapy. begin systemic therapy. discuss the option of a biologic therapy. "
"Being determined doesn't just happen out of nowhere. It comes from a strength of character that you build to succeed in the manner that you want to do succeed. Remember that one person's idea of success is going to be incredibly different than another person's.Start with your fundamentals. Decide what exactly it means to succeed. Is success about getting a psychology degree and becoming a child psychologist? Is success about getting married and having ten children?  Ask yourself questions like: what do you daydream about? how do you want people to see you? how would you like to make an impact in the world? what would you want to leave behind (troubles, attributes, people, etc.)? Questions like these will help you figure out more clearly what success means to you and what determination will help you gain.Consider what would make you happy rather than what would make your parents happy, or your friends happy, or society happy. If happiness for you is having a llama farm out in the middle of nowhere, then start considering how to make that a reality.;  , There are different kinds of determination, which people use at different times. Some of them are more useful than others, and some of them can be combined with others.Up hill determination is when you work to achieve a difficult task despite many or large obstacles in an effort to achieve your goals. An example of this might be a college student taking on more classes than the other students in an effort to graduate early, while simultaneously holding down a job. This type of determination trudges on through obstacles, but it can be incredibly draining and isn't something that can be sustained over long periods of time.  Coasting determination is when you're delaying short-term gratification for the success of long-term goals. This type of determination acts rather than reacts, so that you are making things happen through self-discipline and an understanding of what it is you want. And example of this type of determination in action would be someone who is saving money for a big trip. Instead of going out to dinner (short-term gratification) they save the money for the big trip (success of long-term goals).  Both of these types of determination are good in their own ways, and they should be used in conjunction with one another. There are times when you will need to employ the uphill determination rather than the coasting determination, because there is an immediate obstacle that you need to work through.  Once you know what success means to you, you will need to come up with goals that will help you achieve that success. It's best to have a combination of big goals and small goals so that you are constantly accomplishing things, which will bolster your determination to keep going.  This will also help you take your goals step by step. If you focus too much on the overall picture (the big goal, or the achieving success) you'll probably start to feel overwhelmed which will make your determination harder to maintain.  For example: If you define success as publishing a novel, your goals will include writing the book itself, editing it, learning about the publishing industry, figuring out which literary agents to send it to, writing a synopsis and cover letter, and sending it off to the different agents and publishers.  Once you have the goals that you want to achieve, then it's time to develop the specific ways you're going to achieve those goals. The more specific your plans and strategies, the easier it will be to be determined when you have actionable steps to keep you motivated.Create a timeline for your goals. Mark them down on your calendar to keep you on track. Make a list of the long-term 'big' goals and the shorter-term smaller goals that will help you achieve the bigger ones.  Remain flexible with your goals and your timeline. Don't beat yourself up if you end up needing more time to complete something, or if you decide that a goal you had is actually not that important to you.  Make a plan to deal with temptations. Things will happen that will make it so you'll want to give up, or you'll want to give yourself a break. Have a plan to deal with the temptations so you don't end up giving in to immediate gratification. For example: for the person who is planning the big trip, they might keep a reminder of the trip with them so that when they are tempted by eating out, they remember what they're saving for. Also, they could make meal plans so that they don't end up on a situation where it's simply easier to eat out.  It's hard to accomplishing things, even when you're determined, if you don't have a clear idea of what you're accomplishing and what is outside of that limit. This doesn't mean that you restrict yourself, because you don't want to limit yourself too much, but being clear about your boundaries will make accomplishing things much easier.  For example: instead of saying I'm going to work on my novel every day, set aside a specific time. Say, 'I'm going to write from 6:00 am to 8:00 am every morning.' There are no vague boundaries with this, you have set very specific parameters, which makes it easier to follow.  Often, when you get feedback or work on improving yourself, you focus on the things that need to be improved. Don't ignore those things, but figure out your strengths and use those to help you succeed and use your determination to achieve your goals.Have friends/coworkers/family/teachers give you examples of times when you excelled (when you used your strengths). Locate common themes throughout the examples and create a picture of your strong suits.  For example: if people choose examples of times when you were incredibly honest, or worked really hard, or came up with creative solutions to problems, then use those to craft the image of yourself based on those strengths.  One important habit to learn and to cultivate is being flexible. This doesn't mean folding your body up into a pretzel, but it does mean being able to deal with life when it throws you a curve-ball. When you're too caught up in making exactly what you think should happen, happen, you forget to pay attention to the surprising opportunities.  Check in with your goals and strategies. Don't just assume that something that seemed important when you were 24 is going to be important to you when you're 34. People change and grow and you have to make sure that your priorities and goals are changing to reflect that. Don't keep doing something because you think you have to do it. If it isn't helping you to succeed, then scrap it.  Try something new. Getting outside of your comfort zone helps keep you flexible and prepares you for dealing with the unexpected. It's also a good way to practice your determination. For example: if you've never really experienced the outdoors, you might try out hiking, starting small and working your way up to climbing a whole mountain, or doing overnight hiking.  Change up your regular routine. A good way to keep yourself from getting into a rut and then not being able to handle surprises in life. One day instead of driving home, take the bus, or ride your bike. Do something spontaneous after work, or go to a different coffee shop than you usually use.  This is a hugely important part of being determined and achieving your goals. Negative thinking will keep you mired in negativity, which in turn makes the obstacles and curve-balls of life far more difficult to deal with. Positivity, on the other hand, allows you to persevere.  Pay attention to your negative thought patterns. Learn to identify the negative language you use on yourself and situations. For example: if you find yourself thinking 'I'm so weak I can't even do one push-up,' change that thought. Instead think, 'My goal is to be super strong and to that end I'm working on doing push-ups.'  Use the list of positive qualities your community help you to create in the previous section. When you start in thinking negatively about yourself, stop and consider the list that they made.  You, just like everyone else, have areas that you need to work on. Maybe you're a less than effective communicator or you have a bad temper. Acknowledging that there's room for improvement is great! The problem comes from focusing exclusively on those traits and seeing yourself as determined only by those traits.  Confidence is the ability to believe in yourself, no matter how bad things are looking. Self-confident people experience a hurdle and believe that they can overcome it. This, in a nutshell, is determination. Determination is seeing a roadblock and believing that you can get past it, not necessarily because you have evidence that you've done so in the past, but because you can't picture yourself not getting past it.Practice confidence until you actually start to feel confident. Walk tall, stand in a power pose and act like you take up space and that you matter (because you do matter). The more you practice acting like you matter, the more you'll trick your brain into believing that you do.  Don't compare yourself to other people. You might feel like you aren't as determined as your older sister, or you aren't accomplishing as much as your best friend. Ask yourself whether what they are doing is important to you. The things you are accomplishing are going to be different than what your friend is accomplishing. You have different goals in life and different definitions of success. Don't limit yourself by comparing your accomplishments to other people.  You'll need to make sure that goals you're setting for yourself and the timeline you're setting is actually achievable. This is why it's important to keep your goal load manageable, but still challenging enough that you have to maintain your determination.Pick your battles. Don't try to force your way through every single obstacle and goal. When you hit a really big obstacle, it's good to stop and consider what's the point for going ahead.  For example: say you feel you really want to go into space as an astronaut, but you end up with a debilitating disease which makes it impossible to pass the physical tests. You would have to reconsider how to follow your passion in a new way (possibly by becoming an astrophysicist, or helping to design space ships, or even finding a way for someone with your limitations to go into space).  An example of a situation where you're being too hard on yourself might be: one of your goals is to excel in college, so you decide to take on the hardest classes you can take, and to tutor other students as well, while simultaneously trying to work, as well. At some point, you'll need to give yourself a break, either by dropping the tutoring gig or taking a least one, less difficult course.  Keeping your determination going can be greatly bolstered by making healthy life choices. It can be much easier to function when you're body is being sustained by good fuel, enough sleep, and a good amount of exercise. All these things can help deal with things like depression and anxiety that can make it much harder to be determined.  Sleep is a big factor in mental health and abilities. try to get at least 8 hours of sleep each night, with as many of those hours before midnight as possible. To help your body get into sleep mode more quickly, turn off your electronic devices (like computer, phone, iPod) at least 30 minutes before you go to bed.  Make healthy food choices. Eat lots of veggies and fruits (especially the dark green and colorful ones, which have more nutrients). Avoid eating lots of sugars and salty or processed foods, which can make you feel sluggish or depressed. Go for good carbohydrates like brown rice, oatmeal, and sprouted wheat. Definitely get enough protein (like eggs, fish, lean meats, etc.).  Exercise for 30 minutes every day. Exercising releases good chemicals like endorphins which can give you more energy and make you feel happier. Exercise can be anything from putting on a music playlist and having a dance party, to going for a long run.  People who are determined and use that determination are people who don't call things 'failures.' Obstacles and learning experiences will crop up in your path no matter how prepared you are. In most cases, obstacles and 'failures' are actually opportunities (as clichéd as this sounds).  Re-frame the problem. One good way to do this is to consider the 'why.' For example, if you're asked to build a bridge across a river and you ask why you need to build a bridge. The answer might be 'because you have to get to the other side.' But, of course, there are different ways to get across the river (a ferry system, a tunnel, fly a hot air balloon, etc.). Considering why a bridge, can open you up to further possibilities (why do you need to cross the river? what kind of materials are available, etc.). Asking these questions will open up a realm of possibilities.  Ask yourself what you've learned from a supposed 'failure.' What would you do differently next time? What factors combined to cause the 'failure' to happen? Was failing really as bad as you feared?  Fear of failure is one of the main things that stops people from gaining their goals, however determined they think they are. Seeing 'failure' as a learning opportunity instead makes you less likely to fear it happening, which in turn makes it easier to accomplish your goals.  Thinking outside the box will greatly help you stay on track and accomplish your goals. This is especially important when you do hit an obstacle, because creative solutions can often provide you with an avenue that you might not otherwise have considered.  Daydreaming is actually an incredibly useful tool. When you're confronted with a problem, taking some time to daydream and let your mind free to consider the problem without restrictions. A good time to practice a little daydreaming is right before you go to bed at night, but you can do it any time.  Asking yourself some questions to open up your creative problem-solving: if you have any resources in the world, how would you approach the problem? If there were no possibility of failure, what would you try? If you didn't have to worry about budget, what resources would you use? If you could ask anyone for help, who would you ask?  , Although it sounds a bit weird, visualization is actually a really powerful technique for boosting your determination. Practice visualizing yourself accomplishing the goals that you are working towards accomplishing. The more clearly you visualize this (with sound, smells, and specific details) the more likely you are to actually accomplish them.  try to meditate every day. This helps to calm your mind and makes it easier for you to stay focused on the things you've chosen as important. try to meditate for at least 15 minutes each day (or choose a specific number of breaths to meditate for, so you aren't constantly checking the clock).  When you forget why you're doing something, it becomes that much harder to keep on doing it. If you lose sight of the things that are important to you, you'll be less likely to accomplish them.When you're confronted by temptation ask yourself 'what do I lose if I give in to this?' For example: if you're tempted by spending money on eating out instead of saving it for your big trip, remind yourself what you'll lose (i.e. it'll take more time to collect the money to go on your trip, or you won't be able to go as many places, because you won't have as much money to use).  Think long term. Envision the future and your life pathways opening up as a result of your hard work and determination now. Realise that being resilient now will be good practice for the future.  Sometimes you really and truly need to take a break to get your energy back into the game. There's nothing wrong with that! Taking a break doesn't mean that you aren't determined, it simply means that you're getting yourself rested for continuing to work hard towards your goals.  Take a break. This can be a big break, like taking a vacation, or it can be a small thing like taking the afternoon off and going out for coffee or going book shopping.  Do something you love. Make sure that you reward yourself for accomplishing things and being determined. This will make you more likely to succeed.  ","define success for yourself. figure out your type of determination. set personal goals. develop specific strategies. set clear boundaries. play to your strengths. practice flexibility. eliminate negative thinking. build your self-confidence. be realistic. make healthy choices. learn from obstacles. find creative solutions. use visualization. remind yourself why determination is important to you. re-energize.

"You are most likely to find a better deal at a nearby hotel than a resort when you’re near a town. Budget accommodations, including motel chains and hostels, won’t offer many features. Many of them may not even offer breakfast. However, these are perfect for staying the night before heading out to the slopes.Search for places near the resort area or town and compare prices according to the features you need.  Self-catering apartments are a growing trend in Europe, but there are still small, cheap examples of these to rent. Search online for listings near the resort.  If you choose a resort that’s near a town, you will have more food, hotel, and transportation options. In addition, some cities are near multiple resorts. This way, you aren’t stuck relying upon expensive resort accommodations.For example, Salt Lake City is near several Utah resorts and Vallandry is near Les Arcs in France.  Flying into a big city cuts down on ticket costs and transportation time to the resort.  Getting yourself to and from the resort adds up. Fortunately, many resorts are serviced by transportation options that save you from spending on gas. Many resorts, such as those in Salt Lake City and Colorado, are serviced by airport shuttles, trains, or buses.Choosing a resort town also helps cut down on expense, as you can walk or take a bus around the town instead of driving.  If you need more freedom than public transportation offers or need to get to a more distant resort, try to get a car that’s smaller and lighter on gas. Cars are good for families and groups that share costs. Compare prices online for airport and nearby independent car rental companies if you can’t drive from home.  Ask the companies about roof racks if you need space for ski gear.  ","choose budget hotels. stay near a town. utilize public transportation. rent a car. "
"One good way is to go to a fair where there are rabbits and contact the owners which are usually listed on the show cases.  3 to 4 litters of 5 to 10 young can be thrown by a healthy, mature female (doe) each year.  One male (buck) can service up to twenty to thirty does, but in order to keep the gene pool healthy, you should have one buck for each 5 does. Make sure you keep records of which does are bred by which bucks, and keep rotating the animals to keep the gene pool as large as possible.  The best meat breeds are California and New Zealand or a combination of the two. Most consider the Flemish Giant unsuitable for a meat rabbit, due to the meat to bone ratio, also the amount of food consumed to meat ratio. It is okay to cross with a New Zealand for meat production.;  , The pen should be a minimum of 5 feet (1.5 m) by 6 feet (1.8 m) for this large breed, but slightly smaller for the smaller breeds. Rabbits need space! The floor should be made of a sturdy wire mesh with about 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm) square holes to accommodate droppings and urine. Do give the rabbit someplace else to stand, however. Standing on wire full time can hurt a rabbit's feet. A full tray or box the full size of the floor of the pen with all four sides about 2 1⁄2 inches (6.4 cm) high should be slid under the pen to catch the animal waste. This tray should be emptied once per week and rinsed with a disinfectant. Be careful when using bleach, as it will react with the urine and give off a harmful gas!  A solid compartment about 1 1⁄2 feet (0.5 m) long and 1 1⁄2 feet (0.5 m) wide should be included in the pen to give the doe privacy while she is having her young. this will keep mortality of the young down to a great extent. Be sure there is plenty of dried hay in the pen when she is 'due'.  There is no set estrous period.  The young should be separated from the mother at about 6 weeks.  The doe is ready for breeding immediately after separation from her young.  The rabbit pregnancy period is 28-30 days, with the doe able to mate within hours of giving birth. However, it's advised to wait a month so as not to overtire her and drastically shorten her life span.  The water should be contained in such a way that the animal will not contaminate it with its body waste. If in an open container, it should be elevated so that the top is at least 4 inches (10.2 cm) above the floor. Conventional water bottles work very well also (except during the winter).  Be sure it has a sweet smell, and has not been water-damaged and become moldy. Red clover and birdsfoot trefoil seem to be the most preferred by rabbits, but they will also do well on alfalfa, Kentucky bluegrass, timothy, and a mixture of native grasses.  Do not over feed lettuces. Any fresh green food such as lettuce from the store or grass from the yard can give your animals diarrhea! However, if they are introduced to grass or weeds gradually, they can enjoy them regularly with no harm. It's the sudden change of food that is most harmful. Also, with free choice hay, the animals will regulate much of their own eating habits.  Medicated calf pellets, available at a feed mill which dairy farmers frequent, can help keep your rabbits free from diarrhea. They will cost you less than the 'bunny' pellets per pound, but can contribute to the overuse of antibiotics and are not available in all cities. Very important: When you are ready to butcher, place your animals in an especially clean environment for 2 weeks prior to slaughtering and feed them conventional rabbit pellets rather than the medicated calf food to clear the rabbits from the effects of the anti-biotic which is in the calf food. Remember these rabbits will not be considered organic which is a personal choice.  ","rabbit breeding stock can be obtained from many different sources. get the right pen. know that female rabbits will conceive at any time they have an 'encounter' with a buck. the pen should be furnished with clean water each day. feed a good quality hay. hay should be contained in a lattice manger, or rick to keep it from being contaminated by the animal's waste. another feeding option can be to use calf manna along with rabbit pellets, or 'rabbit food'. "
"This is one of the oldest methods of preserving meat.  Use curing salt which can be purchased online through retailers such as butcher-packer.com, mortonsalt.com, and sausagemaker.com.Place pieces of meat in air-tight storage jars (or plastic storage bags), making sure to fully cover the meat with salt. Alternate layers of meat and salt to ensure all parts of the meat are covered in salt.Keep the jars/bags in a cool place (36-40 degrees Fahrenheit) for a month. Do not allow to freeze.Determine how long to salt cure meat using this formula: 7 days per inch of thickness. For example, a 12-14 pound ham which is 5 inches thick will need to cure for 35 days.Salt cured meat can last 3-4 months without refrigeration if kept in air-tight packaging such as plastic bags.  You will want to rinse the excess salt off the meat before cooking.  ","cure meat with salt. "
"The journey to self acceptance and love begins with self knowledge. As an obese person, you may have had many changes in size and shape over your life, or you may have always been about the same size. You may have tried dieting and weight loss, confronted prejudice, loved or hated your own body, and confronted challenges with friends, family, coworkers, and romantic partners.  Reflect on your size throughout your life as well as times when you perhaps lost or gained a significant amount of weight.;  , Do your family members have a similar body size as you? Your weight could be attributable to your genetics. While there are some families whose members are mostly small, many others come from families whose members have higher body mass indexes. In embracing your own weight, it can be very helpful to similarly affirm and accept the body size of your family members. Loving yourself is entangled with loving them, too.  Before you can properly begin goal setting, you should think about where you are at the moment. You may have been told in the past that you can't be fat and healthy, that your goal should be weight loss and nothing else, or that being fat is your fault. Doctors may have ignored your health concerns and told you that losing weight would solve the problem. Don't accept those comments! Obesity can sometimes be beyond our control, and diet and exercise won't change our size, as is often that case depending on the kinds of medications you may be taking or any health conditions you have.  Often times, taking any medicines that are steroid based can cause weight gain. One medical condition that can also cause obesity is hypothyroidism., Often times, feelings of anger, depression, or denial can arise if you are unhappy with your size. One way to begin resolving these issues is to seek community with those who are fat positive and who embrace obesity. There are many communities that you can seek out, whether online or in person.  One such community is Abundia, which holds a yearly retreat for women of size to foster fat positivity. Another online community is NOLOSE for those who identify as fat and LGBTQIA. , An eating disorder is a serious condition that affects the obese and the slim indiscriminately. Doctors often ignore eating disorders in fat people and instead praise weight loss and encourage unhealthy eating habits. If you think you may have an eating disorder, look for support. Ask fat-positive community members for references to find an understanding health professional.  Seek out the help of a therapist if your emotions surrounding your weight begin to feel overwhelming. There is no stigma in seeking help if you need it and there are many therapists trained to help their patients work through body issues and develop self acceptance and confidence.  Ask questions before seeing a doctor to gauge their competence with obese patients. Get a full check-up and find out what health factors you need to watch out for, and how you can improve your health and reduce your risk of disease outside of weight loss.  Some questions you can ask are “Apart from weight loss, what can I do to improve my health?” or “do you have experience working with obese patients who do not want to lose weight?” You can also take recommendations from obese friends in regards to their primary physician.  If you feel that you were not given a job or any other opportunity simply because of your weight, you should report this to your HR department or to the highest possible authority at your place of employment. If this does not produce the justice you desire, you can also seek legal counsel. Many law firms or organizations, like the American Civil Liberties Union, will represent you free of charge if they decide to pick up your case.  Of course, fighting against injustice can be tiring and you may prefer to just avoid such situations--if this is your outlook, then the fat-positive online community may be able to help you find support and safer spaces.  Diets fail because the goals are often unrealistic. Try to improve your health by eating more fruits and vegetables, eating a balanced diet, avoiding foods that make you feel sick, and getting regular exercise (both aerobic and strength training). If you lose weight, don't think of it as a 'point' or a 'win,' just a side effect of what you're doing that is value-neutral.  Don’t get caught up in dieting fads, like eating no carbs or going on juice diets. These diets are often unhealthy and will often result in immediate weight loss, but when stopped, most tend to gain this weight back.  Seek out a nutrition or personal trainer to help you with your goals. Food restrictions, health conditions or disabilities can often make achieving your goals more difficult, so find help if necessary.  This philosophy challenges the idea that health necessarily means losing weight and being thin. HAES bloggers and online community members can provide suggestions on exercising while fat, staying healthy, and finding support in your area.  What is your current weight? Evaluate how you feel about your body right now. Consider the emotions that arise when you think about your body. Are there things you love and/or about your body? Make a note of any negative feelings, and recognize that they are valid and you can get past them in time.  Write down any feelings you have in considering these questions. It can often be cathartic to take some time to truly reflect on your weight from a variety of angles and writing down your thoughts can be helpful in this process.  Think about how those negative feelings might be linked to the lessons you've learned about obesity in school, at home, at work, or from the media.  Often times, we can allow ourselves to become so fixated with our weight that we neglect the other and perhaps more important parts of ourselves. Set goals for yourself that have nothing to do with your physical health. Take time to develop yourself more as a person which will allow for a deeper sense of self appreciation and joy to grow.  Consider setting goals like reading one book per month, calling your grandmother once per week, or volunteering at a local soup kitchen.  Look for fat role models and images of beautiful people who look like you, or share physical characteristics with you. One model who has been an inspiration to many is Ashley Graham, who is both full figured and beautiful.  Adopt body positive mantras. A few are “thick thighs save lives” and “Fat is beautiful.”  , Think about the things your body can do--for example, you may enjoy sports, the arts, yoga, or dance. Often, when the media depicts obesity, it is from the perspective of limitation or hindrance. Begin thinking instead of the ways in which your body is incredible.  Look for books or DVDs about hobbies that you enjoy that are geared towards fat people. Start to think of fatness in a positive or neutral way, rather than negatively.  If you've felt cut off from these kinds of hobbies because of your weight, but are interested in them, look for friends who might want to continue this hobby with you.  If someone calls you fat, start something like “Great observation! How long did it take you to deduce that, Sherlock?' Or, if someone congratulates you for weight loss, challenge their assumption that losing weight is positive.  You will feel beautiful, powerful, and strong when you wear clothes that you like and that fit your body well. There is a huge community dedicated to 'fashion' and finding great clothes for fat bodies. If you're into fashion, consider following some fashion blogs online to build a fat-positive self image or creating your own.  Don’t shy away from taking fashion risks. Wanna wear a crop top? Go for it. Love that new two piece you found that’s on sale? Buy it and rock it at the pool. Challenge that notion that showing skin is a practice only for slim people.  There exists so much negativity in society about fatness and obesity that it can be difficult to find people who are positive, kind, and affirming. However, you do have the ability to choose your friends. Surround yourself with people who think you are beautiful!  , There are certain negative people who may be be impossible to avoid, like family or coworkers. Show them kindness even if they are rude to you and show them your beauty even if they show you ugliness. It may be helpful to also confront those who are rude to you in a way that is assertive yet concerned.  You might say something to an uncle who picks on your weight like “I’ve noticed that you often say very hurtful things to me about my body, and I’ve always wondered why? I know that you love me, but sometimes your words don’t show it and it makes me want to come around family a bit less when I know that you will be there.”  If you confront someone in a way that is heartfelt, you will often find that they will be subsequently less likely to say mean things to you in the future.  ","reflect on the history of your weight. assess your family history. recognize that obesity can sometimes be beyond your control. seek a supportive community. address eating disorders. find supportive doctors. refuse to accept size discrimination. make overall health your goal, not weight loss. look for resources on 'health at every size' (haes). take a current body inventory. develop goals beyond your weight. bring fat-positive images and words into your life. develop a strengths based approach to your body. develop clever comebacks to insults. find clothes that flatter your figure. surround yourself with positive people. respond to negativity kindly yet assertively.

"Many people find experience more valuable than physical goods. When it comes to spending your money wisely, it may be a good idea to spend on experiences over objects. Instead of buying an expensive new blu-ray player for the living room, consider taking a weekend trip to a nearby city and seeing the town.Experiences tend to stay with you. They will take on new meaning with time, and provide happy memories you can treasure. A physical object may lose some of the newness with time, especially an object like food or drink that will be gone. The pleasure of an experience, however, tends to last longer.  You may want to save for bigger experiences instead of spending extra income on goods one month. For example, sacrifice your monthly dinner with your wife for a few months. Put the money you're saving towards a family vacation.;  , When making purchases, you can sacrifice some luxury for smaller pleasures. People tend to think if they spend more on a purchase or experience it will somehow be better or more enjoyable. This is actually not the case. People tend to enjoy small, inexpensive luxuries more than large, pricey treats.Instead of getting front row tickets for a baseball game, opt for seats in back and go twice. You'll get two outings for the price of one, and will probably have a better time without the pressure. If you spent a lot on something, you may feel obligated to enjoy it, creating stress if anything inadvertently goes wrong.  When it comes to food, consider spending less when eating out. Make a meal out of appetizers instead of ordering a main course. You'll enjoy the small treat just as much, if not more, than a major indulgence, and you'll save some money in the process.  If you're planning a certain purchase, wait on it. Studies show people tend to be happier when anticipating an event than when the event is occurring, so you'll get more happiness from your money by waiting a bit. Also, if you wait, you'll make wiser choices in the present. If you know you'll be treating yourself soon, you're more likely to cut back on spending in the present in anticipation. If you know you're taking your wife to a very expensive restaurant for your anniversary next month, you'll likely spend less on groceries in the present.Also, with some purchases, prices may go down if you wait. If you want the latest version of the iPhone, for example, you may find the phone goes down quite a bit a few months after its release.  People are often tempted to make purchases simply because certain items are on sale. This results in spending money on products you do not truly want. A good way to combat this is to make a separate e-mail for coupons and offers from your favorite stores. Prior to a planned shopping trip, browse this e-mail and see if there are any relevant sales prices. This way, you'll go for sales when you planned to shop anyway. Create a separate e-mail and give this out when asked for your e-mail when checking out at stores.  Keep a notebook with you and jot down all your expenses. Hold yourself accountable to how you're spending your money. You'll find yourself spending less and less when you realize how much of your hard-earned money goes towards frivolous purchases.Jot down how much you spent at lunch, and on things like a coffee on the way to the train. Calculate this number at the end of the day. Calculate all your totals for the day at the end of the week.  You may be surprised at how much money you spend on small, easily avoidable purchases. For example, say you spend $3.00 on coffee 5 days a week on your way to work. That's $15 a week, which results in $60 a month. You can easily cut out this expense by investing in a thermos and taking coffee from home.  ","spend on experience over physical goods. savor small pleasures. wait on big expenses. have an e-mail for coupons. write it all down. "
"The best way to ensure you won’t look at internet porn is to eliminate the source—the internet. Put away your smartphone, tablet, and computer, or give them to a friend or family member for safekeeping. Spend a few days away from the internet and allow your mind and body to detox.  Try doing this with a friend. Spend a full day with a friend in which both of you leave your devices at home and do not use them at all. Having someone else’s support might make the process easier.If you are giving up your smartphone, temporarily switch to a disposable cell phone in the meantime. You can buy them just about anywhere, including most gas stations. Give this number to the people you talk to regularly so they can still contact you. Make sure you pick a disposable phone that does not have internet access.;  , If you are privately insured, look for a provider in your network. Some other therapists in your area may offer their services on a sliding scale. Do some research on your chosen therapist and see if one of their specializations is addiction.  There are online resources for overcoming pornography addiction. You can download e-books, or even seek e-counseling over the internet. The downside with this option is that you will need to access the internet to access these services and products., Find something new to do that you enjoy, particularly something that will get you out of the house, or at least out of the area in which you normally access internet pornography. Whenever you get the urge to access these materials, choose instead to do something new.If you find this challenging, consider how much time you spend watching or viewing internet porn, and consider what you could get done with that amount of time if you spent it doing something productive and engaging.  Many former internet pornography addicts say that finding new activities to engage their minds with has allowed them to improve their quality of life, and feel like more productive and useful people.  If you traditionally use internet pornography to become sexually stimulated, try using your own imagination to turn yourself on. If you are in a relationship, focus on your partner. Imagine some fantasies and put yourself back into the physical world.  You might have noticed that when you view internet porn, you are doing so very passively—watching other people act out your fantasies or sexual thoughts. If you take that role on yourself, you might find it more engaging and satisfying.  Keeping a serious addiction problem from your partner can jeopardize your relationship, and the trust your partner has in you. Be honest and open with them about your struggles, and continue to talk with them through your recovery.Understand that your addiction will affect your partner’s life, whether you notice it or not. Any addiction can put a strain on a relationship, as the other partner tries to understand what you are going through. Your partner may feel shocked, betrayed, or even confused by your addiction. But, it is important not to ignore their feelings as you work through recovery.Express to your partner that you need and value their support. Your partner may even need to attend therapy, in conjunction with your own. Consider couples’ therapy as an option.  If you take the measure to automatically block all pornographic material from your electronic, internet-enabled devices, the temptation to view pornography may be more limited, and easier to avoid.  Ask your partner or a close friend to set the password, rather than setting it yourself. This way, even if you want to unlock the blocks or filters, you won’t have the access to do so.  Some options include Google Chrome and Firefox. These browsers contain the capability to block certain types of websites, and are safe for your computer.  Both Google Chrome and Firefox offer add-ons or extensions that you can install within your browser to block pornographic websites and pop-ups. Once you have downloaded your chosen browser, visit the add-ons or extension database for that browser and install a blocker to your browser.Turn on the pop-up blocker in your chosen web browser. This way, if a pornographic pop-up advertisement is generated by any web page, it will be blocked by your browser automatically.  With Google, this option is available under the “Settings” button on the right side of the search page. Click “Turn on SafeSearch” to activate this setting.The safe search setting will block all kinds of different inappropriate search results, including pornographic websites. It blocks the results in all search categories, including images.  You can turn this function on and off very easily, but there is also an option to lock it in place with a password or pin. If you want to block these search results from other people in the household, use the lock option.  You can access internet pornography from any device that is connected to the web, including smartphones and tablets. Make sure you enable these safe search and blocker capabilities across all of your devices.  Check the manual on your smartphone or tablet on how to install these blockers. How you install and use them will depend on which phone model you have, and which browser is installed on it., Most email service providers have a dedicated spam folder that automatically filters suspicious email messages, but it’s important that you don’t open any of these messages, click any links in them, or download any attachments. If you receive an email from a suspicious account or an address you don’t recognize, avoid accessing any material it contains.  Up to 25% of all spam emails contain pornographic material. By avoiding opening or accessing material in these spam messages, you can protect your devices from pornographic material, and also from any viruses that these spam emails sometimes contain.Don’t respond to these messages. Responding will validate to the spam sender that your account is active, and that spammer might continue to use, sell, and spam your email address.  You can use a number of free and effective anti-malware and anti-spyware programs to scan your hard drive for viruses and remove them. Having certain malware on your computer could be setting you at a higher risk to get pornographic pop-up ads, so erasing them from your hard drive is important.  Free programs like BitDefender are easy to download and use, and will effectively protect your computer from malware and spyware that can make your device more vulnerable to viruses.  This extends from both internet usage on laptops and computers, to accessing the internet via a smartphone, tablet, or other handheld device.  Talking to your children is the first line of defense when it comes to keeping them safe from internet pornography. Let them know your views on accessing this kind of material, and what kind of things you think are inappropriate for them to see.Set consequences for breaking these rules. Make sure your children understand that they are not allowed to access these materials, regardless of the circumstance.  Even with certain blocks in place, some young people have found ways around them. Searching for things like “childbirth” or “breastfeeding” can often generate search results that slip through the pornography filter, but are still inappropriate for your children to see.Check to make sure your children haven’t figured out how to unlock any filters or blocks you have installed. Make sure you have used passwords or pins that they would not be able to guess.  Keep browser security up to date. If you browser needs an update, make sure you download and install it. These security features will help block pop-up ads that may contain pornographic material as well.  If your family members have their own computers or laptops, ask that they use them with their bedroom doors open, or out in a more public area.Since smaller devices like smartphones or tablets can be more difficult to monitor, try to limit your child’s time with these devices. You might even ask that they leave their smartphones and tablets out of their bedrooms at bed time.  ","take a break from the internet. seek the help of a therapist. try some new hobbies. use your imagination. keep an open, honest dialogue with your partner. set up blocks and filters on your own devices. download and use a reliable and safe web browser. set your search engine on “safe search” mode. install the same blockers on any other internet-enabled devices. do not open spam emails. run a security check on your computer. talk to your children and set rules for internet usage. keep an eye on your childrens’ browser histories. keep the family computer in a public area of the house.

"How often do you find yourself on auto-pilot, or going through the motions without really paying attention to what is going on? It is in these moments that we often allow our anxieties to grow. Mindfulness is about being aware of what is going on around you, and taking it all in. In general, people who practice mindfulness are usually less anxious.  One way to practice mindfulness is to pay attention to your breathing. Focus on your breathing and what happens to your body as you do so. Feel your chest expand and fall and take note to any differences you feel as you breathe deeply. Another way to get into mindfulness is to choose an activity in which you often go on “auto-pilot,” and take the time to notice everything around you while doing it.  These simple exercises can help you to become more comfortable with mindfulness, which may make you feel better about your situation., Quieting the mind, especially when you are feeling stressed, worried, and nervous, is something that people often find extremely difficult. When you are able to, however, you often find that you feel calm and at peace with yourself. Meditation is a simple way to clear your head and help you find the peace you long for.  To start meditating, sit in a comfortable position, close your eyes, and breathe slowly. Begin by taking five minutes out of your day to do this, then gradually increase the length. When your mind begins to drift, acknowledge what you were thinking, rather than trying to kick it out of your brain, then begin to focus on your breath again.Deep breathing brings more oxygen to your brain and activates your parasympathetic nervous system. It can reverse some of the side effects of anxiety, lowering your blood pressure and slowing down your heart beat., You’ll likely find that when your body is feeling good, you’ll experience less anxiety and find peace. Therefore, you need to fuel your body with nutritious foods that support your well-being. Choose whole, real foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean sources of protein, and dairy options that are low in fat.  Stay away from fast or convenience foods. It can be tempting when you're stressed, but these foods only make you feel worse.Say 'no' to sugary desserts, caffeine, alcohol, salty snacks, and drive-thru meals to feel like your best self.  When you don’t take care of your body, your mind often suffers. Combat this by exercising for at least 30 minutes every day. Doing so releases endorphins, which are nature's 'feel-good' hormones that lift your mood and give you energy to face whatever comes your way.Visit your local gym to get in some cardio or strength-training. Or, simply go outside to ride a bike, go on a hike, or walk your dog around the block.  Sleep and stress work in a chicken-or-the-egg dynamic — it's hard to tell which came first. If you get little sleep, you will experience greater anxiety. If you're feeling stressed out and anxious, your sleep will be negatively affected.Counteract this by creating a sleep routine that optimizes you getting quality rest.  Avoid naps too close to bedtime. Turn off TVs, phones, and computers at least an hour before bed since the blue-light from these devices keeps you awake. Make your bedroom off-limits to other activities besides sleep or sex. And, try to go to sleep and wake at the same times every day.  A Stanford University study found that walking in nature for 90 minutes can have a positive effect on your mental health.Other studies have found that having access to nature can reduce stress, depression, and anxiety.Try taking a hike hike, going camping, rock climbing, swimming, or fishing in a lake. Practice mindfulness and allow yourself to be in the moment — take deep breaths and smell the air, notice the sounds and sights around you.  Opening up to the healing connection of nature could potentially provide further insight into your own personal experiences and how you are emotionally and cognitively affected.  ","practice mindfulness. meditate. eat right. exercise. get enough sleep. reconnect with nature. "
"Triangle ABC is an obtuse angled triangle having the obtuse angle at C. Squares are constructed on each of the three sides AB, BC and AC. Further, BC is extended and from A, a perpendicular is dropped on the extended portion of BC which meets it at D.;  ,  We need to prove that the square constructed on the side which subtends the obtuse angle (the side AB) is larger than the other two squares taken together by twice the rectangle contained by either of the other two sides (say BC) and its extension (CD, in this case). This can be done if we prove that the area of the square constructed on side AB equals the sum of the areas of the squares on the other two sides plus twice the area of the rectangle which can be formed by BC and CD.

"Instead of cooking the grilled cheese in a skillet, this sandwich is baked in the oven. To ensure that it’s hot enough to melt the cheese, preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius) and allow it to fully heat., Take 1 large, rectangular loaf of focaccia bread, and use a sharp knife to slice it half horizontally. Place the bottom piece on a large cookie sheet with the cut side up, and leave the other aside for a moment.Ideally, you should use a foccacia that fits tightly on an 18-inch by 13-inch (46-cm by 33-cm) baking sheet.  On top of the piece of bread on the cookie sheet, spread 1 ½ pounds (680 g) of grated cheddar cheese in an even layer. If you want to add any other fillings to the sandwich, such as crumbled bacon, sundried tomatoes, caramelized onions, or pesto, sprinkle them over the bread as well.You can substitute any cheese that you like for the cheddar. Just make sure that it melts well. Fontina, Gouda, provolone, mozzarella, and Colby are all cheese that melt well.  If you’re planning to add other fillings to the grilled cheese, spread half of the cheese over the bread, lay down the fillings, and then cover them with the remaining cheese.  Once you’ve added all the cheese and other fillings to the sandwich, place the other piece of foccacia on top with the cut side down. Set a large, heavy skillet that’s oven-safe on top of the sandwich to help weigh it down.If you only have smaller oven-safe skillets, use multiple pans to weigh down as much of the focaccia as possible.  With the heavy pan on top of the focaccia, set the baking sheet in the preheated oven. Allow it to bake until the cheese melts, which should take 8 to 10 minutes.Keep an eye on the sandwich to ensure that the focaccia doesn’t burn.  Once the cheese is completely melted, remove the grilled cheese from the oven.

"Before you reach out to a breeder, you will want to choose a particular breed of dog to purchase. A reputable breeder will only raise one particular type of breed of dog, so identifying your preferences will automatically narrow down your contact choices.You can identify a breed that is a good fit for you by looking at the traits of the group. For example, take into account the breed’s fitness level as well as their particular grooming needs.;  , Ask them if there is a particular breed that they would recommend for you. And, see if they have any recommendations regarding local breeders. Most good breeders will have a strong working relationship with a local vet, in order for their dogs to receive the best of care. This is a great way to find out about those breeders who don’t advertise their services, but do a good job.You might ask, “Do you provide care for any breeders in the area? What type of dogs do they breed and would you recommend them to me?”  , Your local dog club likely keeps a detailed list of breeders operating in their area.

Owning a purebred dog is great and you can often find these types of dogs in shelters as well. It make take a bit of time and you may need to get an older dog, but adopting can be well worth the effort. You should also consider a mixed breed dog if you are not interested in dog competitions.

Look at the AKC website for additional details.  To find a local shelter in your area, you can go to the Petfinder website. Or, you can enter your city name and “animal adoption” into a search engine.  Once you’ve got a breeder’s contact information, reach out to them as soon as you can. It may take a few attempts to finally establish contact as breeders are known for being extraordinarily busy and they spend a great deal of time outdoors. If you call, just leave a message with all of your contact details.If you leave a message, it is a good idea to tell the breeder how you found out about them. They may be more likely to call you back quickly if you found them via a professional contact, such as a vet.  In your opening statements, you may also want to make it clear that you are not interested in just any purebred dog, but that you are looking for one that meets particular requirements regarding lineage and care. You might say, “I’m trying to find a Pomeranian breeder who manages the breeding process from start to finish.”  , After you’ve passed the introductory phase, you should head into a conversation about the breeder’s background and professional credentials.

Ask them how many successful placements they’ve made and how they determine the mating pairings. Ask how many puppy they’ve had returned as well for health or behavioral issues.  A good breeder should be in love with that particular breed of dog and more than willing to tell you anything and everything about its characteristics.

If you have a family, you might discuss how well the breed does interacting with a number of people in a home setting., You are buying the breed, but you are also buying a single puppy with a unique personality. Talk with the breeder about whether or not they raise the puppies in-house or purchase them elsewhere. The best breeders do everything themselves. In your conversation, the breeder will likely mention a particular litter that they think will fit your needs.If the breeder offers to place you on a waitlist pending the next litter, this is a good thing.

"Some STDs have no symptoms and can only be detected and diagnosed with a test. If you are concerned about STDs, the best thing to do is to get tested. Most states have laws that allow anyone over the age of 13 to get tested for STDs without parental consent. To find out more about getting tested for STDs, you can either talk with your family doctor or visit a health clinic, such as Planned Parenthood.Some common types of STD tests include:  Urine test. Your doctor may request a urine sample to determine whether you have chlamydia and gonorrhea, the two most common STDs. You will urinate in a cup and then the doctor will send the cup to the lab for tests..  Blood sample. A blood sample can show whether you have syphilis, herpes, HIV, and hepatitis infections.A health care worker will prick you with a needle to take some blood and run the tests.  Pap smear. For women who do not show symptoms, this is the only way to detect human papillomavirus. If your pap smear shows unusual changes, a DNA test can reveal HPV. This test is only available for women.There is currently no reliable way to test HPV in men.Swab test. A swab of an infected area can determine if you have trichomoniasis. Your healthcare provider will take a swab of cotton and rub it on the infected area, and send it to the lab for tests. Since only 30% of people with trichomoniasis develop symptoms, getting tested is often the only way of knowing if you have it.Swab tests can also be used to test for chlamydia and gonorrhea as well as herpes.;  , The color, texture, and smell of discharge can help identify the STD contracted as well as pain during urination. Only you know your body, but if you think you are experiencing unusual discharge or urination, that could be a sign of:  Gonorrhea in females and males with increased discharge from genitals (usually white, yellow, or greenish) or burning sensation during urination.Women may also experience menstrual irregularities and swelling of the vulva. Four out of five women and one out of 10 men who have gonorrhea do not have symptoms.Trichomoniasis may be present in both females and males with burning urination or in females with unusual vaginal odor and discharge (clear, white, or yellowish).However, about 70% of infected people do not have any signs or symptoms.Chlamydia may be present in females and males with discharge or painful urination.Women may also experience abdominal pain and the urge to urinate more than usual.

Rashes and sores in specific parts of the body may indicate that you have an STD. Pay extra close attention to any rashes or sores on your genitals or mouth, as these are more commonly associated with STDs. If you experience an outbreak of some kind, see a doctor or visit a health clinic as soon as possible to get a diagnosis.

These sores (called chancres) usually appear near the genital areas and are and they can appear about three weeks to 90 days after infection.Painful blisters or sores in genital areas or the mouth may indicate that either and male or female has contracted herpes. These blisters can appear as early as two days after contraction and last one to two weeks.Genital warts can indicate that either a male or female has contracted human papilloma virus. They usually appear as a small bump or groups of bumps in the genital area. They can be small or large, raised or flat, or shaped like a cauliflower.HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection and nearly all sexually active people get infected with HPV at some point in their lives.. In most cases, HPV goes away on its own, but when it doesn't, certain types of HPV can cause cervical cancer in women., Some STDs are difficult to recognize because the symptoms are similar to the common flu. They include: a cough or sore throat, a runny or stuffy nose, the chills, fatigue, nausea and/or diarrhea, a headache, or a fever.If you are experiencing flu-like symptoms, talk to your doctor to find out if you have the flu or if you might have an STD.  For example, exhibiting flu-like symptoms after sex can be indicative of syphilis or HIV in either men or women., Sometimes STDs can cause swollen glands and a fever. For example, if your glands are tender or feel painful when you press on them and you are experiencing a fever, it may be a sign of the herpes virus.Most often, the glands are swollen near the site of infection, and the glands in the groin area are often swollen with genital infections.  If you do have herpes, your symptoms will likely appear two to 20 days after infection., There are many reasons that you may be experiencing fatigue.

For example, itching or irritation in the penis could be a sign of trichomoniasis in men or bacterial vaginosis in women. Chlamydia can also cause itching, especially of the anal area  If trichomoniasis symptoms develop, they will occur in three to 28 days..  If bacterial vaginosis symptoms develop, they will occur anywhere from 12 hours to five days.Bacterial vaginosis can also be contracted through other means besides sexual contact (such as using a copper coil as a contraception means, smoking, or taking frequent bubble baths), therefore there is debate on whether it should be classified as an STD., If you suspect that you have a sexually transmitted disease, make an appointment with your doctor right away or visit a health clinic. Prompt treatment of STDs is crucial to help prevent long-term effects from disease and spreading it to others. When left untreated, some STDS can cause serious long-term health problems including hair loss, arthritis, infertility, birth defects, cancer, and rarely, even death., Some STDs can be treated with antibiotics while others cannot be cured at all. Regardless of your situation, it is important to follow your doctor’s instructions for how to cure or manage your condition. If you receive a diagnosis for an STD, your doctor will advise you on your treatment options and give you information on how to avoid spreading your STD to other people.Your healthcare provider may prescribe medications to treat your condition or at least to lessen the severity of your symptoms.  There is no cure for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B, or herpes. However, there are treatments available to help mitigate symptoms.  There are several ways to decrease your chances of contracting an STD infection. Make sure that you choose the method that works best with your lifestyle. The methods you can use to help prevent contraction of an STD include:Abstain. The only sure way to ensure that you do not contract an STD is to abstain from oral, vaginal, and anal sex.  Use protection. If you do engage in sexual activities, use a latex condom to minimize the possibility of contracting an STD.  Be monogamous. One of the most reliable ways to avoid STDs is to be in a mutually monogamous relationship. Have an open conversation with any partner about whether they have been tested before engaging in any activities.  Get vaccinated. For hepatitis B and HPV, you can be vaccinated. This helps ensure that you will not contract the diseases even if you do come into contact with them during sex. The hepatitis B vaccination is usually administer to infants at birth, but be sure to check. The HPV vaccination consists of 3-dose series of shots and will protect against the most common forms of HPV.  ","talk to your doctor or visit a health clinic to get tested. note any difficulty with urination and any unusual discharge. pay attention to rashes and sores. observe flu-like symptoms. check for swollen glands and a fever. determine if you are experiencing fatigue. identify abnormal itching. see your doctor. follow instructions for treating your infection. do everything you can to prevent the spread of stds.

"In Spanish, the endings of some words are changed to o or a depending on whether you are speaking about a male or female. When referring to a female, you say está contenta, “she is happy,” with the a ending. When referring to a male, you say está contento, or “he is happy,” with the o ending.None of the other words for happy have endings that change to a masculine or feminine form.;  , If you are saying something or someone is happy as a temporary state of being/feeling, you should use the estar form of happy. Estar is more common for talking about happiness in Spanish. If you are saying someone is a happy person as a permanent way of being; however, you will use ser.  An example of estar would be if you said, Estoy contento de que vinieras, or “I (male) am happy you came.” Being happy about an action is an impermanent state, and so you would use estar.  An example of ser would be if you said, Siempre ha sido una niña muy alegre, or “she has always been a happy (cheerful) little girl.” You are saying this is her permanent way of being, and so you use ser in the present perfect, ha sido, or “she has been.”  , Decide on how you need to conjugate the verb you are using in order to convey the correct meaning. Conjugating verbs can be complex in Spanish, and there are many different conjugations depending on the subject and tense you are using. Follow the in-line citations to see all of the ways to conjugate estar, which is the most common verb that you will use with happy. If you are speaking in the present form of estar to say you or someone else is happy, use the following conjugations:  I am happy- Estoy feliz  You are happy- Estás feliz  She/he or you formal is/are happy- Está feliz  We are happy- Estamos feliz  They are happy formal- Estáis feliz  They are happy- Están feliz  , For example, if you would like to say Me siento feliz, or “I feel happy,” remember that the verb sentirse is reflexive. Reflexive verbs are shown in the example, Me llamo Juan. Me llamo Juan translates directly to “I call myself Juan.” In English, we don’t have reflexive verbs. However, in Spanish you add the me in front of the present I form of the verb for llamar, or to call to make the reflexive form Me llamo.  Me (myself) siento feliz  Te (yourself) sientes feliz  Se (himself, herself, yourself) siente feliz  Nos (ourselves) sentimos feliz  Os (yourselves) sentís feliz  Se (themselves, yourselves) sienten feliz  , If you are saying we, you all, or they are happy, for example, use the plural forms felices and contentos.  For example, if you say, Estamos felices de estar aquí, or “we are happy to be here,” you say estamos felices because “we are happy” is plural.  For another example, El grupo de las niñas están contentos con sus venta de las galletas, or “the group of girls are happy with their cookie sales.” Here there is more than one girl selling cookies, and so because it’s plural, contenta becomes contentos.  In Spanish feliz and contento can be used pretty much interchangeably. But contento, like its cognate in English, content, is more closely translated to saying someone or something is pleased. For example, you might ask, ¿Tú estás contento con tus calificaciones?, or “are you happy (pleased) with your grades?” To be happy (pleased) with something, you would say, Estoy contento(a) con mi nuevo vestido, or “I am happy with my new dress.”  Contentar is also a verb that means to please or satisfy. , Feliz is typically used to express a state of being that is not permanent. For example, you might say, Aquí hemos sido muy felices, or “we have been very happy here.” You could also tell someone that they have made you happy. For example, you might say, Me haces feliz, or “you make me happy.”  , You could talk about someone’s disposition being cheerful. For example, you could say, Creo que soy una persona bastante alegre, por lo general, or “I think that I am a pretty happy (cheerful) person, in general.” Because you are saying that you are a cheerful person as a permanent state of being, you use the ser form of I am, soy.  You can also say that something someone has done has made you happy. For example, you could say, Me alegro que llegaste temprano, or “I’m glad that you came early.” In this case, alegrar is a reflexive verb that means to cheer up or rejoice. Directly translated it would mean, “it makes me glad that you came early.” But in English we do not use reflexive verbs in the same way, so it makes more sense as “I’m glad.”, The word for happiness is felicidad, a feminine noun. The plural of this word is used to say congratulations: ¡felicidades!  To wish someone a Happy Birthday, say ¡feliz cumpleaños!  To wish someone a Merry Christmas, say ¡feliz Navidad!  To wish someone a Happy New Year, say ¡feliz Año Nuevo!  , Here happy means that you are willing to help. For example, if you want to show your willingness to do something, you might say to someone, Con mucho gusto se lo comprobaré, or “I would be happy to check it for you.”  Se is used here to refer to used.  Placer is also a verb that means “to be pleased.” For example, you could say nos place que te quedas aqui which means “it pleases us to have you stay here.” If you have had a good experience, something was to your liking, or you want to say that you enjoyed something, you can use either word. For example:  Me da mucho gusto que... (It gives me much pleasure that...)  Es un placer. (It is a pleasure.)  Fue un placer. (It was a pleasure.)  El gusto es mío. (The pleasure is mine.)  , For a correct pronunciation, say Es-toy con-ten-ta. With an emphasis on “toy” and “tenta.” Remember that depending on whether you are speaking to a guy or a girl, you will say contento or contenta. , Spanish is a great language for learning correct pronunciation because unlike English, there are no silent letters. You pronounce every letter in a word.  The one exception to this rule is that you do not pronounce the h at the beginning of words.  Saying shorter vowel sounds will help you sound more native. Vowels in Spanish are easier to learn to pronounce than in English because there are only 5 sounds as opposed to 12.Notice that i and e in Spanish have different sounds than in English. The Spanish i vowel sound is more similar to the ee sound in English. The e vowel sound is more similar to the eh sound. a - ah  e- eh  i- ee  o- oh  u- oo  , In English, typically the stress goes on the first syllable in the word. This is the opposite in Spanish. If you have a word with 2-3 syllables, you will most likely put the stress on the second or third syllable. Look at the following words that are the same in English and Spanish, and you can see how the stress is changed. The stress in the English words are on the left, and the emphasis for the Spanish words are on the right.  LEgal = leGAL  ANimal = aniMAL  HOSpital = hospiTAL  POSsible = posIBle  , Look for dialogue in Spanish that has a recording that goes along with it. First practice saying the dialogue aloud and then listening and speaking along with the recording to hear how your pronunciation should be. Repeat this process several times. You can watch a movie in Spanish with subtitles. First mute the movie and read the subtitles aloud, then replay the same part and read the subtitles aloud with the audio to hear the difference.  ","use the correct masculine or feminine form of contento(a). use the correct verb of to be, ser or estar. conjugate estar based on the time you are referring to and who you are talking about. consider reflexive verbs. make feliz or contento plural if the subject is plural. use contento(a) to talk about being pleased. say feliz to express contentment. try using alegre to talk about being cheerful or glad. congratulate or wish someone a happy birthday/happy holiday. say con mucho gusto to say you are happy to help. express that you enjoyed something with gusto or placer. practice your pronunciation saying estoy contenta. pronounce all of the letter sounds in spanish. pronounce your vowels with shorter sounds. change the stress on your words. practice with a written and recorded spanish.

"In order to organize and carry out the plans for a school dance, you need a fair amount of people. Make sure these students are fairly well regarded in the school because if you are talking to the principal you will need to show you have responsible team to support your idea.  Print out 'Help Wanted' flyers and pass them around to students and teachers. DON'T be afraid to to ask people. They most likely want the same thing as you but are too shy to speak up about it.  Ask the leaders of involved extracurricular clubs and teams at your school to talk to the groups. Students who are involved in school-organized clubs and activities are more likely to take interest in a school function like a dance. Try asking if you have one. They're usually the ones who handle school functions. Also, you could talk to a sport or club who needs more publicity in the school. They might be willing to help out.  Get the student council involved. This will help to get the word around, and it may even better your chances at winning the administration's approval.;  , It's crucial that everyone involved gets the memo You can't run a school dance without people knowing important details, such as the theme, considered dates and times, dress codes, etc. School dances are really hard if you're unorganized. Have a good foundation with people who are natural born leaders.  Work together to decide on a theme that is fun, feasible, and school appropriate. Some popular themes include Wild West, 'Under the Sea', 'A Night in Manhattan', Hollywood, 'Sock Hop' and  , Alternatively, depending on the time of year, you could choose to have a holiday or seasonal-themed dance, such as Halloween, Valentine's Day, Christmas, etc.  Construct a dress code. To avoid revealing, risqué dress, come up with a list of Do and Don't  Follow the standard school dress code. The dress code most likely already addresses rules against overly revealing, skimpy clothing, offensive symbols, slogans, and/or images, and colours/symbols that promote violence, sex, drugs, and other subject matter that is not appropriate for school. It's a good idea to clearly state that for the dance dress code, all of the same rules  , It's way easier to handle dress code when you have a theme. choose a theme for the dance and everyone will follow. It's way easier to catch the students who stand out in a crowd of hippies while wearing booty shorts.  Consider the formality of the dance. For formal dances, students may be required to wear nice, formal attire; this means no jeans, tennis shoes, baggy clothes, t-shirts, baseball caps, etc.  Make a list. This includes needed supplies, such as decorations, food, beverages, etc., as well as volunteers to decorate, set up, clean up afterward, etc. Assign different roles and  ,  Provide music. You could hire a DJ, but if your school is a little low on cash, maybe you could find a student or parent willing to do it for free. Alternatively, among the student body, there may very well be aspiring musicians, vocalists, or bands looking for gigs. Just make sure that the music played at the dance is relatively clean if somewhat suggestive, and does not promote subject matter that is inappropriate for school.  Decide on the type(s) of music that should be played. Make sure that at the dance, you play music that everybody can enjoy. While you can't please everybody, try to add as much variety  , Compromise! You can check Billboard on the hottest music too.  You can sell cupcakes, pizza, ice cream and other foods. Be creative!  , Put a portion of the proceeds toward the school football team, art department, air conditioning units, etc. When the proceeds go to a good cause, the dance becomes a fundraiser, which will appeal to the administration. This also goes along with having a club or sports team sponsor you.  They have the best interest of the students.  They may suggest a different theme, or a different date. Think of this not as criticism, but as constructive advice. Ask them for advice when you and your planning group have trouble making decisions.  Type up the ideas and plans that you and your group have decided upon, and have your proposal read over by adults before you submit it. Also try to avoid using low diction. Try to sound like you know what you are talking about and sound very educated. Your principal is going to expect the best out of you, so live up to his/her standards and maybe if you give a good enough proposal, he/she would  ,  ","scout up a decently large group of students who share your interest and are willing to help plan, set up, and attend the dance. schedule a meeting(s) to plan the dance. outer space. apply. responsibilities to each person. as possible; this means that you shouldn't play all hip hop or rap, nor should you play all rock or alternative. fund raise to help fund your school dance. support a good cause. get feedback from teachers and staff members. and school in mind, so listen to what they say. present your school dance proposal to the principal in a professional manner. help out money wise.

"Adults who don’t receive the type of emotional support they need growing up are often withdrawn when it comes to romantic relationships. They shy away from intimate relationships because they are unsure of how to show affection, likely because they weren’t shown the affection they needed when they were younger.You may find that the person with childhood emotional neglect doesn’t communicate with their partner, doesn’t express feelings or emotions, doesn’t show empathy or compassion, or seems uninterested in the relationship.;  , You may find that the person is extremely insecure about their role in the relationship.

"In the U.S., bounty hunting is backed up by the 1872 Supreme Court case Taylor v. Taintor, but regulations vary from state to state. In yours, it may be illegal or you may need specific licensure. The professional organization representing this industry is the National Association of Fugitive Recovery Agents . Information can be had online or with a quick call to your local police department, courthouse, or in a visit with a friendly bondsman.  It's a good idea to research the legal requirements for neighboring states or countries too, as you may not be able to follow a suspect there unless you meet those requirements.  In most places other than the U.S., the activities of a bondsman (pledging money or property as bail to secure the appearance of a criminal defendant in court, in exchange for a fee from that defendant) are illegal, which eliminates the role of a bounty hunter. If you cross international borders in pursuit of a fugitive, your acts as a bounty hunter could get you arrested.  In fact, the only two countries that use commercial bail bonds are the US and the Philippines. This is just one of many laws where the US goes it alone.;  , Let's get honest here for a second: In some places, Hobo Joe off the street could be a bounty hunter (he would never be suspected, that's for sure). But in others, you may need to pass a background check. If you're not a convicted felon, this'll be a piece of cake.  You're thinking of Dog Chapman, that felon in Hawaii with that bounty hunting TV show, aren't you? Well, sure, he's a felon -- but did you ever notice how he doesn't apprehend the criminals himself and how he doesn't carry a gun? There. You want to carry a gun, right? And do the arresting yourself?, Again, this all depends on where you live. But if you want to travel across the country, you'd be better off having one.

"Whenever it is available, you must include the last name of the author or authors responsible for the work. One way to name the author is to introduce him or her in the sentence before you introduce the information provided by that author.  According to Jones, this premise is false (2010).  A study by Smith, Doe and Rowell indicates that this is only a misconception (2002).;  , If you do not introduce the author or authors in the sentence, provide the last names in parentheses after the borrowed information. For works with multiple authors, separate the last two names with an ampersand (&).  This premise is false (Jones, 2010).  Even though it was previously accepted as fact, this is only a misconception (Smith, Doe & Rowell, 2002).  Whenever available, include the date of publication in parentheses following the borrowed information. If the author's name is included in parentheses, as well, separate the two with a comma. If no date is provided, indicate as much with the abbreviation “n.d.”  Erikson claims otherwise (1999).  Some experts claim otherwise (Erikson, 1999).  Research shows that this long-held belief is “nothing more than an old wives' tale, at best” (Johnson & Smith, n.d.).

"To make a rainbow smoothie, you need to blend different combinations of fruit together to make the different colored layers. So along with your ingredients, you'll also need:  Seven sealable freezer bags or freezer-safe bowls with airtight lids.  Sharp knife and flat surface for preparing the fruit.  Strainer for draining the washed berries.  Blender and a mixing spoon.  Five large cups. Alternatively, you can pour one smoothie and freeze the rest of the prepared fruit for later. This recipe makes about 12.5 cups (3 L) of smoothie, or five 2.5-cup (591 ml) servings;  , As you prepare the fruit, it’s important to keep it all separated until your ready to combine the ingredients for the different layers. To wash and cut the fruit:  Peel the bananas and orange. Leave the bananas whole. Chop the orange into one-inch (2.5-cm) chunks.  Wash the raspberries under running water and place them in a strainer to dry off. Repeat with the blueberries, spinach, and strawberries. Cut the stems off the strawberries.  Wash the peach and cut it in half to remove the pit. Cut the peach into quarters.  Wash the beet and cut off the tail and the stem. Cut the beet into quarters.  Peel the pineapple and mango. Cut the fruit from around the core of the pineapple and the pit of the mango. Cut the fruit into one-inch (2.5-cm) chunks.  This rainbow smoothie will have seven layers in total: purple, blue, red, magenta, green, yellow, and orange. Place the fruit bunches into separate freezer bags once it’s all divided out.  Purple layer: combine half a banana and the blueberries. You can also substitute mixed berries or blackberries. As you portion out the bananas for the different layers, cut them into one-inch (2.5-cm) chunks.Blue layer: one banana and ½ cup (82.5 g) of pineapple. You will use the food coloring to turn this blue.  Red layer: half a banana, and ¼ cup each of raspberries (31.25 g) and strawberries (50 g).  Magenta layer: half a banana, the beet, and ¼ cup each of raspberries (31.25 g) and strawberries (50 g).  Green layer: one banana, the spinach, and ½ cup (82.5 g) of pineapple. For a more vibrant green, add ¼ of an avocado as well.Yellow layer: one banana and ½ cup (82.5 g) of pineapple.  Orange layer: half a banana, the peach, the orange, and the mango.  It's important to start with frozen fruit, because this will give the smoothies the right consistency and help the layers stay separated. You can add lots of ice to a regular smoothie, but that will dilute the colors.  Once all the fruit is divided and portioned into bags or bowls, place it in the freezer for a few hours or overnight., To make each smoothie layer, you will also need yogurt and orange juice, or another liquid for blending. Keep these ingredients cold and in the fridge until you're ready to assemble your smoothie.  You can use Greek, regular, coconut, or soy yogurt for the smoothies. Each smoothie color will require ¼ cup (61 g) of yogurt.  Good blending liquids for the smoothies include coconut milk, water, and dairy or non-dairy milk. Each smoothie color will require about 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of liquid.  To make an accurate rainbow, start with magenta on the bottom, followed by purple, blue, green, yellow, orange, and finally red on top.  In the bottom of the blender, pour in ¼ cup (61 g) of yogurt and 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of orange juice. Then add the fruit for the magenta layer, which is banana, beet, raspberries, and strawberries.Always add the liquids to the blender first, as this will prevent air bubbles from forming.  When you start up the blender, start on a low speed. As the fruit chunks get smaller, increase the speed until the mixture is smooth and free of chunks.  As you blend, add more orange juice if you need to loosen up the fruit. You can also turn off and unplug the blender to stir the smoothie if necessary.  Place ¼ to 1/3 cup of magenta smoothie into the bottom of each glass. You want about the same quantity of each color per smoothie, which will work out to roughly a one-inch (2.5-cm) layer of each color. To make even and flat layers, pack the smoothie layer down with the spoon. Place the glasses into the freezer until you're ready to add another layer.If you're only making one smoothie, pour the remaining magenta smoothie back into the freezer bag and save it for later.  When the blender is empty, rinse it out with warm water so that you don’t mix colors making your next layer., Make the purple layer next by adding the yogurt, juice, and fruit. Repeat using the same process as you did for the magenta layer. When you're ready to pour, remove the glasses from the freezer and spoon in a one-inch (2.5-cm) thick layer (on top of the magenta.) Pack it down and return the cup to the freezer.  When you're making the blue layer, don’t forget to add the food coloring, otherwise you'll have another layer of yellow. The food coloring is necessary because blue fruits, such as blueberries, actually turn purple when blended.  If you don’t want to use artificial food coloring, you can find natural food coloring, or skip the blue layer.  Leave the individual fruit combinations in the freezer until you're ready to make that layer. This will help keep the fruit layers frozen, which will keep the colors from blending together. For each fruit layer:  Add the yogurt and orange juice first.  Blend the mixture until smooth, adding more liquid if necessary.  Remove the glasses from the freezer and spoon in a one-inch layer of smoothie on top of the previous layer.  Return the glasses to the freezer until you add the next layer. Place any unused smoothie back into the freezer.  Rinse out the blender.  You can serve the smoothies with either a spoon or a straw. As long as you keep the leftover fruit colors separate in the freezer, you can easily make more rainbow smoothies another day.  ","gather your supplies. wash and cut the fruit. combine the fruit for the different layers. freeze the fruit. chill the liquids. blend the fruit for the magenta layer. make the first layer of the rainbow. blend the fruit for the purple and then blue layers. repeat until you have a full rainbow. serve and enjoy!

"Most bake sales are for raising money for a charity or cause. Be sure you and your customers understand who or what you are raising money for. Have posters or other advertising materials. It may help to make pamphlets or other media presentations available to explain your charity. This is a great opportunity to promote your cause, too.Put out a jar for tips or donations. If you are raising money for a cause, give people the opportunity to donate without buying. Some people may not be hungry, or cannot buy sweets due to dietary restrictions, but they still might want to support your organization.  Make sure you know how to send your profits to your charity.;  , Get your friends and family to help. If this is a fundraiser for a school, get the students involved. Let the kids have the option of participating in the fundraiser by baking goods with their parents to sell in the bake sale, and give them appropriate responsibilities.Make clear what the cause is, when the bake sale is, and have reasonable shifts available.  How many volunteers you will need will depend on the size of your proposed bake sale. A small bake sale may be easily handled by one experienced volunteer. However, a large bake sale may need several people to coordinate helping customers, the cash box, setting up and taking down, and baking.  You might want to make one person in charge of organizing the volunteer bakers, one person in charge of renting the venue and the equipment needed, and one person in charge of publicizing the event.  Generally, you want to be in a high traffic area. For instance, have your bake sale at a well-frequented public spot or in a school or college. If the bake sale is for your school, ask the Student Union, administration, or other appropriate staff for possible venues on the school grounds.Sometimes retail stores will be happy to have a booth set up nearby.  Community events, such as festivals and special events like street fairs, outdoor public concerts, and other big public events are all excellent choices.  At schools, plays, concerts, open houses, sporting events, parent nights are excellent bake sale opportunities.  Make sure that it is legal to hold at the spot you choose, and get permission from the appropriate authorities, if applicable.  Be sure you have a 'rain site' to do the bake sale indoors or under a tent in case the weather turns sour.  You may be lucky and have a table and chairs available already and a sign made up already--especially if this is a yearly event. But if you do not, you will need to plan ahead. You may need:  Booths or tables  Card tables or folding tables  Some sort of awning, like a pop-up pavilion or gazebo to protect from rain or sun  Tablecloths  Decorations and signs to grab attention  A cooler and ice to keep items like drinks cold  A garbage container and garbage bags for cleanup  Folding chairs  Crock pots to keep liquid items warm  A cash box. You need to keep your funds in some sort of container. Be sure it has change for large bills!  , The best way to ensure a large number of potential customers at your bake sale is to have it coincide with another event. Or, if your bake sale is for your school, make sure you have it during a time when the greatest number of parents and kids can attend, such as a weekday evening. Some ideas for events to place your bake sale near include: elections, PTA events, school games, and community events.You will also want to make sure your date is in the sweet spot between being so soon that not enough people hear about and so far that people forget about it. Somewhere around two weeks from when you announce it should work., Make sure you assign your volunteer bakers certain items to make through something like a sign up list, so you don't wind up with too many of some goods, and not enough of others.  If many people in an organization are baking, ask them to package things in sale-size quantities, perhaps two to three cookies to a package or one cupcake or larger item.  Give the volunteer bakers a specific method for packaging their finished goods. It's a good idea to have every item individually wrapped in plastic wrap or a plastic bag, to avoid contamination that might cause allergic reactions.  All the goods should have the ingredients listed. Many people (especially children) have food allergies and sensitivities and dietary preferences. Providing a list of ingredients help people stay healthy and happy while supporting you. Knowing that a cookie has nuts in it or not may make a big difference.  An index card by the dish is an easy way to do this. You can also put sticky labels on plastic bags.  Marking items with common allergens can be helpful (tree nuts, strawberries, peanuts, etc.).  Also mark foods which may be a good choice for certain people, such as gluten-free brownies, Kosher treats, vegan cookies, or nut-free items.  Try to include some healthy options too, instead of just cupcakes and pie. Not everything has to be sugary at a bake sale. Fresh homemade bread, pretzels, and corn muffins can sell too., Remember, it is a bake sale, so you don't have to get too caught up in the money as long as it is for a good cause. Optionally, you can even opt not to set any prices at all, except something like a $1 minimum, and let people pay what they want on the 'honor system'., Decide who is going to do what once you start the event. Delegate people to retrieve and set up the equipment, someone to organize the goods and volunteers once they arrive, and someone to keep track of the money.Invite your friends that will contribute and try hard. Make sure you have an adult around so if you need any help, they'll be there to help.  If you live in a suburb, consider moving the sale to the corner of your street, or to the front of the neighborhood. Move your set up to the reasonable area., Design attention-grabbing and colorful media with the date, time, place and cause being supported. Design and share posters online or put paper ones up in well frequented areas.If you are selling at a school, have your bake sale announced over an intercom, in the daily notice or school paper, or whatever is available.  Advertise your organization through your clothes. If you are raising funds for your scout troop, for instance, wear your uniform.  Bake sales are a good opportunity to bake a variety of goodies. A bake sale needs baked items, which ideally will be homemade. Have all your baking volunteers bake the goods the day before the sale, to ensure maximum freshness.You could bake the items yourself and this is usually the cheapest way. Divide the baking between many members, if possible.  Alternatively, buy them from a local bakery or shop. This is particularly effective if people don't usually have access to such goods, such as at a high school. It also is easier for people who can't cook, or don't have the time.  A lot of people like to have a bit of liquid to wash down sugary treats, and it is an additional chance for you or your group to earn a bit of extra money.  Coffee, tea, iced tea, lemonade, water, and soda are all good options. However, use common sense: hot coffee probably will not sell well on a hot summer day.  Set up the tables, donation box, and signs. Keep track of all the volunteers arriving, and let them each know where they should set up their goods. Bring a supply of small paper plates, paper towels, plastic forks, napkins, cups if you are serving drinks that require them, and plastic wrap, bags, or foil. It's best to keep these to a minimum, as they cut into profits and create waste.All these tasks can be delegated to some of your team members. Don't try to stretch your own efforts too thin by putting yourself in charge of too many tasks.  Double check that everyone is where they should be, and all the tables are full of delicious baked goods, and start selling. If you planned it well enough, this should be the easiest step of all. Consider getting some music going to make the atmosphere more fun and welcoming.Have a cash box and start with a reasonable amount of change in it. Write down the amount so you can calculate how much you've earned at the end. Keep the cash box safe throughout the event.  Thank the customers for their support as they leave the event.  'Hey! How are you? Try some delicious treats for a low price!' If the customer decides to buy a cupcake for example, consider packaging it in a cute cardboard box., Have a specific time when the event will end. Once it reaches that time, politely let everyone know that the bake sale is wrapping up. Let all the customers currently buying goods finish before you start packing up.  Once the event is over, count the money earned and thank all the volunteers for their help. Help them pack up their unsold goods.  Be courteous and leave your area as clean or cleaner than you found it. Remove all the tables, chairs, and other equipment rented for the event. Clean up and throw away all the trash. Ask some of the volunteers to help you with this., Let the volunteers know that they are of course free to take their leftover goods home with them, but also provide an option for them to donate their unsold baked goods. Contact a local food shelter or nursing home and ask them if they would like to take your unsold goods. Then ask one of the volunteers to deliver the goods, or do it yourself, as soon as possible, so they're still fresh.  ","have a cause. make your team. decide on a venue. get all the equipment you need. decide on the time. assign the baking work. give instructions on how to pack the goods. give instructions on what to label on the packaging. have a variety of types of baked goods. set reasonable prices. coordinate the work. decide on an area you'd like to sell at. publicize the event. make the goods. get drinks to sell as well. set up the event. get the party going. be polite when greeting the customer. end the event. leave the area clean. send the leftovers somewhere.

"A plumbing snake (also sometimes called a 'flexible cleaning tool' or 'auger') is a flexible coil of wire that can 'snake' through the curves of a drain and get deeper than a wire can. The best snake is a 'closet auger' which is designed specifically to clear toilet clogs without damaging or staining the bowl. A plumber would likely use a closet auger., Push down, feeding the snake further into the drain until you feel an obstruction.  The goal is to break up the obstruction into smaller pieces that can move through the pipes. It may take a few minutes of maneuvering to clear the obstruction. Once the water drains, flush to toilet to see whether it drains as quickly as normal.  It may become necessary to remove the toilet and run the snake through in the opposite direction. This is especially true with hard obstructions that may have been flushed by a curious child. If a hard obstruction is known, and you are not comfortable removing and replacing the toilet, contact a plumber.  ","purchase or borrow a plumbing snake. insert one end of the snake into the drain. twist and push the snake through the obstruction. snake in reverse. "
"Shoot by yourself and really focus on your technique. Take shots from different angles around the post. Focus on the quality of the shots you are taking and not the number of shots. Evaluate each shot and ask yourself some questions:Did I flick my hand at the end of my shot?  Did my elbows touch my ears throughout my shot?  Did I bend my knees?  Did I keep my arms stretched above my head?  Did I release the ball above my head?, It is much easier to shoot when you have no one defending you. However, this is an unlikely scenario when you are playing a game. Have a partner defend you as you practice your shooting. Practicing with a defender in front of you will simulate game pressure and teach you to shoot the ball over the defender.  Ask your partner to point out any mistakes in your technique during this drill.This drill can help you build confidence in your shooting abilities.  Your technique may suffer when you become tired. Incorporating cardio into shooting practice will help you build endurance and stamina. Place a ball anywhere in the semicircle. Sprint to the sideline, sprint back to the ball, pick up the ball, and then shoot. Try to get in 10 shots as fast as you can.You will need a partner to retrieve balls for you during this drill. Your partner should place the ball in a different spot in the semi-circle each time.Focus more on your technique as you become tired.

"The most basic way to accept payment through PayPal is to create a personal account on the PayPal website. Creating a personal account allows you to link an e-mail to the PayPal service that can be used to accept money as well as pay money for items and services. The person paying you would need to go to the PayPal website and select Send Money. After entering their e-mail and account information, they would then send the money to the e-mail you provided. The person paying you can use either their credit card or their bank account to send payment. After the transaction completes, you could then transfer the money from your PayPal account and into your checking or savings accounts. This option is very useful when accepting payments for work provided or one time payments for selling items through classifieds or auction sites.;  , If you are trying to sell items through your own business or from your website, PayPal allows you to set up a business account. Go to the website, select sign up, and after entering your information make sure to select the premier or business account option. The differences between the two depends on whether you are an individual selling items or a company selling items, so choose according to your need. After your account is confirmed, PayPal will allow you to create buttons that tie in to your products. It will ask that you set the price for your product and then give you the code to place on your website. When the button is clicked, users of your website will be able to pay you for the product using cash or their credit card. Just like with a personal account, these payments can then be placed in your bank account like any other cash transaction.  Read the PayPal agreement closely. Depending on the amount of transactions and type of business you are running, PayPal will charge you different fees. Each transaction made through PayPal is subject to a flat fee as well as a percentage of the sale. For example, if you are selling many smaller items, choosing the micro payment pricing option will charge you .05 cents a transaction and 5% of the total transaction cost. If you are selling larger cost items, the default transaction fees will be .30 cents per transaction and between 1.9% and 2.9% of the total cost of the sale.  A third option that PayPal offers is the ability to accept donations. Adding a donation button to your website is done the same way as adding a payment button. The difference is that the donation button allows users to enter their own transaction amount. While transactions through this method are still subject to PayPal fees, PayPal does offer discounts for legally registered non-profit organizations.

"Rinse the beef tongue under cool running water and pat dry with clean paper towels.  When buying beef tongue, it is especially important that you purchase it from a reliable source. You may need to buy it in frozen form, rather than buying it fresh, since it is not a common cut of meat in most geographic areas.  Put the beef tongue in the bottom of the slow cooker. Surround it with your cut onions and garlic cloves, then sprinkle it with salt. Pour the water over the entire thing.There is no need to turn the beef tongue. The flavors of the garlic, onion, and salt should sink into the meat as it cooks.  Cover the slow cooker with its lid before continuing.  The meat should be tender enough to shred when done.  If you do not have a full 8 hours, you could switch the slow cooker to high and cook the beef tongue for 4 to 5 hours, instead.  Do not remove the lid during the initial cook time. Doing so can release too much steam, and since the steam is partially responsible for cooking the meat, letting it escape can increase the overall cook time by another 15 to 30 minutes.  If the meat does not feel tender after 8 hours, you may need to cook it for another 1 to 2 hours.  Place the cooked beef tongue in a large dish or rimmed baking sheet. Make a shallow cut in the skin at the open end of the beef tongue, then peel the rest of the skin off using your fingers.  You should also trim away any fatty tissue at the bottom end of the tongue using the knife.  The majority of the cut will be edible meat, even after you cut away the skin and fat.  Use two forks to shred the tongue meat into pieces. Work from the outside and move inward into the cut of meat.  Place the shredded tongue meat into a large mixing bowl. Ladle a little of the cooking liquid on top, then toss well to coat.  Use enough liquid to moisten the meat without drowning it.  Ideally, the liquid should be degreased and strained before you pour it over the meat.  The barbacoa beef tongue is ready to eat and enjoy. Serve it on warm tortillas, and offer garnishes such as cilantro, chopped white onion, and salsa.  ","clean the beef tongue. place all the ingredients in a slow cooker. cook on low for 8 hours. remove the skin of the tongue. shred the meat. moisten the shredded meat. serve. "
"In the original 3 maps (Verruckt, Shi No Numa, and Der Riese) there are 4 machines spread out on any Nazi Zombie map and they each have their own specific power-up.  Juggernog: This is probably the most important perk you can buy in the game. It is pricey (2500 points) but it is well worth your money if you want to survive in the game. The Juggernog makes your resistance to zombies better. What I mean by that is Zombies without the Juggernog can kill you in 2 hits. With the Juggernog, it will take 5-6 hits before you go down, making it an invaluable survival tool.  Quick Revive: This is cheaper than the Juggernog (1500 Points)but it is still worth your money. The Quick Revive is just what it is, it allows you to revive your teammates quicker than usual. This is important in later rounds as zombies get quicker and harder to kill, so the less time you spend trying to help someone, the better. In Solo Play, you can revive yourself with a purchase of a quick revive. When you go down with the perk, you automatically get revived. While your down and getting revived, the game gives you the upgraded version of the starting pistols (Mustang and Sally), which are now grenade pistols.  Speed Cola: This is a perk that allows you to reload your gun faster and to aim faster; it is basically a sleight of hand perk. This is the most expensive power-up (3000 Points) so save your money up to get it. This power-up comes in handy when you are cornered and need to reload fast. Definitely get this perk, especially if you have weapons that take a long time to reload (LMG's, Thunder Gun, etc.).  Double Tap and Double Tap 2x: Double Tap (2000 points) is a perk that allows your weapons to fire at a faster rate than normal. The original Double Tap is available in the WaW and Black Ops zombie maps. However, the Double Tap 2x; which is available in Black Ops 2 zombie maps, is different from the original. This upgraded version of the Double Tap not only allows you to fire faster, but it also makes your bullets more powerful, which is very helpful to the player. Double Tap 2x is definitely worth getting in the newer BO2 maps, but I would personally stay away from it in the older maps unless that is the only other perk you can buy outside of the original 3 sodas.;  , These perks are not contained within the first maps (with the exception of mule kick in Black Ops) and some perks are specific only to one map, so you have to play the different maps in order to access all of the new soda machines.  Dr.(PHD) Flopper (found in Ascension, Call of the Dead, Shangri-La, Moon, and Origins): Dr. Flopper (2000 points) is a perk that is found in the all of the Black Ops map packs; it is a perk that allows you to dive and create explosive damage. It is most effective when you dive into a group of zombies from heights (the lander platform area where you buy the Dr. Flopper in Ascension, for example). The zombies are destroyed instantly after you perform the jump. Also, another aid the perk provides is that you are immune to all recoil damage when shooting a ray gun at zombies in close range.  Dead Shot Daiquiri (Call of the Dead, Shangri-La, Moon, Mob of the Dead, and Origins): Dead Shot Daiquiri (1500 points) is a new perk that assists the player with shooting. When you aim down sight with any weapon with this perk, your aim is automatically directed towards the head of any approaching zombie. It also reduces sway in Sniper Rifles. This perk is helpful if you have a hard time aiming your weapon and getting head shots; if your a more advanced player, however, it is not as useful.  Mule Kick (available in every map on Black Ops including original WaW maps, Die Rise, Buried, and Origins): Mule Kick (3000 points) is a perk that simply allows you to have 1 extra weapon in your arsenal. This means that you have the ability to have 3 weapons as opposed to 2. You can treat this extra weapon just as you would your original 2, that includes upgrading it through the pack-a-punch. It is important to keep in mind, however, that if you go down, the third weapon you acquired goes away. Since the extra weapon is a result of the perk, when the perk goes away, so does this extra weapon. Very handy perk to have, especially in later rounds where ammo becomes a factor.  Stamin Up (Ascension, Call of the Dead, Shangri-La, Moon, Tranzit, Buried, Origins): Stamin Up (2000 points) is a perk that allows you to run faster and for a longer duration. It is a perk that is certainly helpful when you need to move through tighter areas of the map and need to move fast.  Tombstone (Tranzit): Tombstone (2000 points) is a new perk (found only in BO2) which allows you to come back to live without losing your perks and weapons. How it works is that when you go down, you are given an option to either hold down the action button and die right away (which says 'don't feed the zombies') or you can wait for someone to revive you. Here is the catch; you can only regain all of your perks and weapons if you decide to hold down the action button and die immediately. If someone revives you before you complete this action, you do not get your perks back, only your weapons. If you die without using the tombstone perk, you would return to the next round in the game as if you never had the perk (with your starting pistol and nothing else). So if you want to utilize this perk, you need to hold down the action button immediately and die. When the next round begins, you need to find your tombstone (the icon that is left where you died the previous round). If you do not get to this icon within a certain amount of time, the icon goes away and you lose everything, so you need to make sure that you re-spawn close to it so you can get all of your weapons and perks back. It is a useful perk, however, risky for your team since now they have to fight the hordes of zombies without you.  Who's Who (Die Rise): This new perk (2000 points) is similar to the last one as it allows you to regain all of your perks and weapons if you go down. There are some differences though, most notable is the fact you have to revive yourself. Once you go down, you are re-spawned in an area close to where you went down. You are now in a limbo mode where you have the chance to revive yourself. The zombies still recognize you are alive and will still try to attack you while you are in this limbo state. In this mode you are armed only with a pistol to defend yourself (no perks). In order to revive yourself with all of your weapons and perks, you need to be able to elude the zombies and revive yourself without going down in this limbo state. You need to do this quickly, as there is a limited time given to revive the player with your limbo character. If you do go down in this limbo state, then you are down for good and need to be revived by another player. If you go don't go down but don't revive your character in time, then that 'limbo' character becomes your playable character and you carry on through the game as normal. If you are now playing with your limbo character, you lose all of your perks and weapons and only armed with the pistol they give you. Not personally one of my favorite perks as it is complicated to use, especially during the later rounds where knifing and pistols do not kill the zombies.  Vulture Aid (Buried): This perk (3000 points) allows you to pick up more points for killing zombies and allows you to see all the items you can buy in the map. When you kill a zombie with this perk, the zombie either drops ammo or money. You have to run to where you killed that zombie to get the extras; an extremely helpful tool when ammo and/or money is tight. Also, the perk allows you to see anything on the map you can buy much more easily as it shows you larger and brighter icons that you can see from anywhere. These icons include the mystery box, other soda machines, and the wall weapons. Especially when you need something on the run, having this perk as a helpful reminder is very helpful.  Electric Cherry (Mob of the Dead and Origins): This new (2000 points) perk activates when players reload their weapons. When a player reloads, a shock is given out and electrocutes the zombies. The power of the shock depends on how much ammo you have left; if you have a lot of ammo, then the shock is small. If you have low ammo and reload, then the shock will be larger.  Der Wunderfizz-This perk (1500 points) provides a random perk to you with purchase, very similar to the mystery box concept. Need to be careful with this perk, as you can only get four perks and you might not get the perks you want through this machine.  ","in order to do well in nazi zombies, there are a few things that every player must do to make it to the higher levels: soda machines: soda machines are powerups (perks) that give you a special ability for a certain amount of time. new perks: as new zombie map packs have been released, there have been new perks that have been added to the game. "
"As part of your annual checkup, your doctor will order a standard blood test that checks your blood sugar level. Ideal targets are between 80–120 mg/dL (4–7 mmol/L) for people younger than age 60 with no other medical conditions, or between 100–140 mg/dL (6–8 mmol/L) for people older than 60 and those younger people who have a history of heart, lung or kidney disease.If your blood glucose levels are higher than these targets you've got hyperglycemia.  Your doctor may also conduct a special A1C blood test, which measures your average blood glucose levels for the past two to three months.  An alternative option is routinely testing your blood glucose at home with an inexpensive store-bought meter that works by pricking your finger and reading a drop of your blood.  In general, your target blood sugar range changes (gets higher) as you get older or if you're pregnant.;  , Once it's established that you have chronically high blood glucose levels and not just temporary hyperglycemia from binging on sweets, your doctor will likely recommend synthetic insulin-based medications.Insulin is a hormone produced by your pancreas to shuttle glucose from the blood into tissues so they can use it for energy production.  Medications for hyperglycemia come in injectable medicines (syringes, pens, pumps) and oral pills. Talk to your doctor about the pros and cons of each and which may be more appropriate for your condition. Injectable medication have to be stored a proper way some need refrigerated while others do not. Make sure that you are storing you injectables properly.  Diabetic medication typically needs to be taken every day, especially if you have type 1 diabetes. Make sure that you take your medicine on time and when you are supposed to. If you are off then this might contribute to your hyperglycemia.  Be careful not to take too much medication because you can easily trigger hypoglycemia, or low blood glucose. Hypoglycemia is the feared complication of aggressive diabetic treatment. Talk to you doctor about hypoglycemia and how to prevent or counteract any side effects from your medication.  If you or a friend or family member start to show the signs of severe hyperglycemia (particularly if you or they cannot keep any food or fluids down), then get to the emergency department of the hospital as soon as you can to get insulin and/or other diabetic medication to stabilize the blood sugar.Once a diabetic coma commences, the risks of permanent organ and brain damage increase significantly.  While at the hospital you'll receive fluids (likely intravenously) until you're rehydrated. The fluids also help to dilute the excess glucose in your bloodstream.  Along with fluids, you'll also get your electrolytes replenished, which are charged minerals (calcium, potassium, sodium and others) needed for normal muscle, heart and nerve function.  Regardless if you have diabetes or not, your diet has a big impact on your blood sugar levels. All fruits and other carbohydrate-containing foods (bread, pasta, rice) get broken down to glucose and absorbed into your blood, but refined sugars such as high fructose corn syrup are absorbed so quickly that your blood sugar spikes — leading to hyperglycemia.As such, focus on fresh foods and avoid prepared foods, which are often high in refined sugar.  Eat lean meats and fish, fresh veggies, whole grains and moderate amounts of fruits, but avoid sugary baked goods, sweet desserts, ice cream, milk chocolate, candy and soda pop.  Your portion size during meals can also have a dramatic impact on your blood sugar levels.Thus, instead of eating two or three big meals per day and risk triggering hyperglycemia, eat four or six smaller meals per day. Stick to meal portions that can fit into the space created by cupping both hands together (as if you're washing your face with water).  Smaller portions don't cause as big of a insulin spike because they don't raise the blood sugar levels as high.  Eating smaller portions will give you energy spread throughout the day without any of the 'sugar rushes' and resulting energy 'crashes.'  Make sure you still stay within the amount of calories you should eat each day. You can use an online calorie calculator to help determine how many calories you need to eat to maintain your weight or lose weight.  Eating food high in fiber (veggies, whole grains, beans, legumes) tends to fill you up so you don't over-eat and risk developing hyperglycemia.Fibrous veggies (celery, carrots, zucchini) also tend to be very low in sugar, so they won't spike your blood sugar levels — assuming you lay off the veggie dips and processed cheese!  Some fibrous fruits can be relatively low in sugar and make good choices also, such as strawberries and apples, but make sure they're not too ripe because the sugar content will be higher.  Instead of white rice and white bread, eat more brown rice and whole wheat bread with flaxseed or nuts.  High fiber diets also keep blood cholesterol levels low and stimulate better digestion and colon health.  According to the Institute of Medicine, women need 25 grams of fiber per day whereas men need 38 grams of fiber per day., Another way of avoiding, minimizing or managing hyperglycemia is via regular (daily) physical exercise;however, don't push yourself too hard with strenuous exercise because it can overly stress your body and trigger temporary hyperglycemia. Instead, stick with brisk walks, hiking, cycling, stair climbing and swimming for good glucose-controlling exercise.  Exercise can lower blood sugar levels because it improves cell's sensitivity to insulin and helps them burn glucose for energy.  Try to get 150 minutes of moderate intensity exercise every week. That is about 30 minutes five days a week.  Don't exercise, even moderately, if your hyperglycemia is so high (typically above 240 mg/dL) that ketones are present in your urine because it can make your blood sugar level even higher., During periods of high stress, both physical and emotional, your body releases lots of 'stress hormones,' which cause a spike in blood sugar levels.This is because stress triggers the 'fight or flight' response and your body needs the extra sugar in the blood for quick bursts of energy; however, chronic stress leads to hyperglycemia and the risk of health problems, such as diabetes, heart disease and kidney failure.  Reducing chronic stressors such as financial strain, job pressures, relationship difficulties and health issues can help you manage or avoid hyperglycemia.  Learn stress-relieving practices such as meditation, tai chi, yoga, positive visualization and deep breathing exercises to help you cope.  Also physical stress injury, illness, infection, or surgery can lead to elevation in blood sugar. Treatment of this type of stress usually involves treatment of the underlying cause and a change to your diabetes treatment plan., Hyperglycemia doesn't typically trigger noticeable symptoms until glucose values are greater than 200 mg/dL (11 mmol/L).Furthermore, the symptoms often develop slowly over several days or a few weeks. The early symptoms of hyperglycemia to look out for include: frequent urination, increased thirst, unusual hunger, dry mouth, blurred vision, headache, numbness in your extremities, reduced sexual desire and fatigue.  If you notice any of these early symptoms, you should either measure your own blood sugar with a home monitor or make an appointment with your doctor as soon as you can to determine if your have hyperglycemia.  Recognizing the early symptoms of hyperglycemia allows you to treat the condition promptly and avoid any further health issues.  If early stages of hyperglycemia goes unnoticed and untreated, it can cause toxic ketones to build up in your blood and urine (ketoacidosis) and lead to: fruity breath, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, dry mouth, general weakness, abdominal pain, confusion and eventually loss of consciousness and coma.Untreated hyperglycemia can ultimately be deadly.  Ketoacidosis develops when your body doesn't produce enough insulin to use glucose, so it breaks down fatty acids to use for energy which produces toxic ketones.Over the long term, chronic hyperglycemia (even if it's not severe) can lead to nerve and circulation problems complications that affect your eyes, kidneys, heart and feet.  The symptoms of hyperglycemia are similar to other serious conditions, such as a heart attack (myocardial infarction) and pulmonary embolism;however, hyperglycemia doesn't typically involve chest pain or any referral pain down the left arm, which is so common with heart attacks. Furthermore, severe heart issues and pulmonary embolisms come on very fast, whereas hyperglycemia generally takes many hours or even days to develop and escalate.  Other conditions that can mimic hyperglycemia include: severe dehydration, central nervous system infection, a head concussion, extreme alcohol intoxication and severe blood loss from a wound.  Your doctor will rule out other conditions and use blood tests to confirm hyperglycemia before beginning treatment.  ","see your doctor and get a blood test. consult with your doctor about medication. know what to do in an emergency. eat a balanced diet low in refined sugars. eat small meals more often. add more fiber to your diet. get regular exercise that's not too strenuous. manage your stress. recognize the early symptoms of hyperglycemia. be alert for advanced symptoms of hyperglycemia. don't confuse hyperglycemia with other conditions.

"Many animals don't like the taste of hot pepper or how it burns their noses. Any commercial brand of hot sauce dissolved in water will do or you can create your own version taking any hot peppers and water using any recipe and putting this in a spray bottle.

Capsaicin oil that is produced in such plants also burns the skin, nose and eyes.  This will not work with birds. Birds are not affected by hot pepper and will still eat plants treated with it.;  , Simply dropping peppermint oil throughout the landscape grounds will keep rodents away for a very long time.

"Prepare two sponge baking pans measuring 20cm round. Grease the sides and line the base with baking/parchment paper. Cover a wire baking rack with parchment paper.

It accounts for about 70% of all canned tuna on the American market.Because this fish has a shorter lifespan than the larger species of tuna, it contains less mercury than other types of tuna. You will often see this type of tuna marketed as “light chunk” in a can at your local grocery store. At a sushi restaurant, it may be referred to as “bonito” or “katsuo.”  , Albacore tuna is one of the most popular and common types of tuna. It has a light taste and has a firm texture.This type of tuna can be found across the world’s largest bodies of water, including the Atlantic Ocean, the Pacific Ocean, the Indian Ocean, and the Mediterranean Sea. This tuna accounts for about 30% of all canned tuna, and is often referred to as “white meat” tuna.Albacore contains almost three times the mercury of skipjack.Young children, pregnant women, and nursing mothers should not eat more than one serving of albacore a week.  Bigeye tuna are sometimes sold or listed under their Hawaiian name “ahi” on a restaurant menu. These fish can grow 8 feet in length and are often used in sushi and sashimi.Bigeye can contain even more mercury than albacore, especially in the Atlantic Ocean. Pregnant women and other at-risk groups should avoid it as a regular part of their diet. Everyone else may want to limit bigeye intake to one serving a week., Yellowfin tuna has a medium to mild flavor and a very firm texture. It is an excellent tuna for grilling and searing. Like bigeye tuna, yellowfin tuna is often referred  to as “ahi” on restaurant menus. These tuna can weigh up to 300 lbs in the wild, but commercial yellowfin typically weigh between 8 and 20 lbs.Mercury levels in yellowfin vary but are rising sharply in some areas. At-risk groups should treat this as a high-mercury fish., Bluefin tuna is considered a delicacy across the world and catching one can earn a fisherman or a distributor tens of thousands of dollars. A single fish once sold for 1.75 million dollars. Because this tuna is highly prized and sought-after, the population in the wild has dwindled greatly.

"Let’s say you’re sending your sister to the store for groceries. You make out this list:  tomatoes  cucumbers  mangoes  mushrooms  ground beef  chicken broth  milk  eggs  rock salt;  , To make that list into a sentence, begin with the person’s name and purpose, which is the subject and verb:  Alex is going to the grocery store to buy…  “Alex” is the subject, the person who is doing the action. “Is going” is the verb, what Alex is doing.  Separate them out with commas. For example:  Alex is going to the grocery store to buy tomatoes, cucumbers, mangoes, mushrooms, ground beef, chicken broth, milk, eggs, and rock salt.  On the one hand, some people say it isn’t necessary. Others say it makes sentences clearer. For instance, if you were writing a list about ice cream flavors and you wanted chocolate ice cream and mint-flavored ice cream as two separate flavors, you might write:  Please buy the ice cream flavors vanilla, strawberry, chocolate, and mint.  If you leave out the comma before the “and,” it makes it sound like you want a single flavor, chocolate and mint ice cream. For that reason, it is more common to put the comma before the “and” in a series than to leave it out.  ","let’s begin with a simple grocery list. write down the subject and verb. add in the list of items. note that before the last item in the list, you use “and.” some grammarians debate whether the comma before the “and” is appropriate; in fact, there is so much debate, it has it’s own special name, the serial comma or the oxford comma.

The pattern contains the pieces necessary to create all of the variations., The design variations, also called “views,” also appear on the back of the envelope. These line drawings include more design details, such as darts, seam lines, and potential lengths. Each view is identified by a symbol, typically a letter. The symbol is used in charts and the pattern to identify information about that specific view., The back of the pattern envelope contains a list of fabrics suitable for this garment. Read through the list carefully. Select a fabric that is appropriate for the garment and that you are comfortable working with., In addition to fabric, your pattern may require notions and trims. The “Notions” section will list all of the additional pieces you will need to complete the garment. These may include items such as zippers, hook and eye closures, and elastic., Pattern sizing rarely aligns with ready to wear sizes. When cutting the pattern, you will follow lines for a specific size. Therefore, it is essential to accurately determine your size instead of assuming that you are a certain size.Use a measuring tape to measure various points on your body listed on the pattern envelope, such as your chest or bust, waist, and hips. Match your measurements to the measurements provided on the chart to determine your pattern size., The fabric requirements are listed directly below the body measurement and size charts. Locate the row containing the design variation you intend to create. Follow the row over until you reach the column containing your pattern size.

The grain of the fabric runs parallel to the selvages of the fabric—the selvages are the finished edges of the fabric.. Each pattern piece will contain a line of arrows that corresponds to the grain line.  Bent grainline symbols. If a grainline symbol is bent at the top, this means the piece should be placed on a fold.  Double layer of fabric. A pattern may call for a specific piece to be cut out of a double layer of fabric., Unfold the pattern and lay it out on a flat surface.

"Home remedies with natural ingredients are always an uncertain science, and the U.S. National Institute of Health doesn't report any to be consistently effective in all cases. Anecdotally, however there are a few things which may have a calming effect on cold sores. You can apply a few drops of pure vanilla extract to the cold sore using a sterile cotton ball three to four times per day.  The vanilla is alcohol based, and will function in a similar basic way to the rubbing alcohol. Vanilla extract also reduces inflammation, making the cold sore less painful.  Only use 100 percent pure vanilla extract. Do not use artificial vanilla, since it does not contain the same anti-infection properties., Tea tree oil is used as a treatment for a variety of skin complaints, and can be used to ease the symptoms of a cold sore. It dries out skin very effectively, which can help your cold sore’s healing process. It also has antiviral, antifungal, antiseptic and antibiotic properties. Dab it directly onto your cold sore with a cotton ball twice a day.  If you have sensitive skin, you may want to dilute the oil with equal parts water before applying it.  Tea tree oil is toxic when ingested, so take care when applying near the mouth.  Be aware that some research has suggested that using a 6% tea tree oil gel five times a day had little impact on cold sores.  You can apply sea salt directly to cold sores on the outside of the mouth or you can gurgle salt water to treat cold sores inside the mouth. With clean hands, press the salt gently into the cold sore and allow it to sit there for around ten minutes before you wash it off.You can do this treatment two or three times a day.  Gargling with a salt water solution can ease a cold sore. Add half a teaspoon of salt to a mug of water.Swish the solution in your mouth for several minutes.  The minerals in sea salt are thought to heal broken, inflamed skin, thereby reducing the severity of cold sores.  Witch hazel has long been used for medicinal purposes, and it can be used to treat the symptoms of a cold sore. It works in a similar way to tea tree oil, naturally drying out the skin to aid healing. Simply dab a few drops of witch hazel extract onto the cold sore using a clean cotton ball once or twice a day.Witch hazel has a tendency to irritate sensitive skin. Before applying it to your face, apply a small amount to your elbow.  If it does not bother the skin on your elbow, you can try applying a small amount to the cold sore.  As with the other drying agents, applying this as soon as you notice the cold sore will give you the greatest benefits.  ","rub a little vanilla extract over the sore. apply tea tree oil. use sea salt. apply witch hazel. "

"Every state has its own rules, and you’ll want to start your transition on the right legal foot. You can find an overview of current homeschool laws here: https://www.responsiblehomeschooling.org/policy-issues/current-policy/  Twenty-four states currently require some periodic assessment of your child’s knowledge. This assessment usually follows one of two formats: standardized testing or a portfolio review.  Standardized testing can be arranged either through local public schools or independently.For a portfolio review, a certified teacher will examine and approve a collection of your child’s work, including writing samples, reading lists, math tests, and science labs. If your state relies on portfolio reviews, you’ll want to start saving examples of your child’s work as soon as you begin homeschooling.;  , You’ll be responsible for school supplies, books, and any online curricular content you purchase. Create a list of these costs and incorporate them into your family’s financial planning., While not all states require that you inform the school about your plan to withdraw, it’s a good idea to exit your public school with courtesy. Have an open conversation explaining why you want to switch, and ask for any advice administrators or teachers might be willing to share.Especially if your child plans to continue participating in extracurricular activities, you’ll want to maintain a good relationship with the school community.  If your child has been in public school for several years, the district will have a file containing their medical and academic records. You’ll want to access these records to make sure they’re not lost when you withdraw your child, and so you are fully aware of your child’s educational experience up to this point., Be honest and clear about your plan to withdraw your child from public school, talk about their needs, and be sure to listen to what they have to say.  Try asking your child questions about what they like and don’t like about school now, and what they would want to learn about if they could pick their own lessons. This will jumpstart a conversation that allows you both to talk about your expectations for homeschooling.Give your child plenty of time to reflect on your conversation and their new reality. Introduce the topic well ahead of the date you plan to withdraw.  There are many different teaching methods and curricula available for homeschooling. Reflect on your reasons for switching along with your child’s learning preferences, and develop your approach according to their unique needs.Choosing your curriculum will largely depend on how your child best learns and how you best teach. You’ll want to decide whether to adhere to a more traditional, textbook-based curriculum, or to take the alternative route by designing and compiling a less structured curriculum.  Some parents choose to participate in established online homeschools. The main benefit of these programs is that much of the content preparation is done for you.  Taking the time to research other parents’ experiences with various homeschooling materials and online schools is the best way to ensure that you’re purchasing high-quality content that works. Reviews will also usually specify the driving teaching philosophy of the curriculum., Up to this point, your child will have spent a large majority of their time at a school that’s not your home. Give them a few weeks off from academic study so they can process their emotions regarding this shift.  Some homeschooling parents recommend giving your child at least two weeks and up to a month of time off from school before beginning your homeschool curriculum.  During this transition, you may want to incorporate hands-on lessons to maintain or renew your child’s enthusiasm for learning. You can explain the chemistry behind baking cookies or take a nature walk through the woods., Pick hours that work for your family, and stick to that plan. Even though flexibility and spontaneity are hallmarks of successful homeschools, especially at the beginning of the transition, you’ll want to ensure that your child recognizes that their home is now also their school.  To set up this schedule, reflect on which hours of the day your child has the hardest and easiest time learning. Schedule difficult subjects during their high-attention hours, and easier ones when they might need less brain power. Be sure not to block more than 45 minutes to an hour of any one subject.  You don’t need to adhere to typical 8:00-3:00 public school hours, but your child may crave continuity as they move away from the public-school model and begin learning in a new environment.  Public schools build in blocks of time for children to either play outside, rest, or study independently, allowing children time to recharge. Make sure that these “relaxed” blocks of time are part of your daily schedule so that your child’s school day contains both work and play., Even if your state doesn’t require that you be prepared for a portfolio review, it’s a good idea to keep orderly records of your child’s progress. This will help your child if they choose to apply to college, or they want to transition back to public school at a later date.  This will be a learning process for you and your child. Make sure your child knows that you’re open to their ideas, comments, questions, and critiques. This will allow your child to feel invested in the transition and their new education.Your child may initially ask you to replicate certain elements of their public school experience. While you made this transition for a reason, let your child guide the pace of the switch.  When your child leaves their public school, they may be most worried about leaving their friends behind. In order to ensure that you and your family are remaining socially connected, continue or expand your child’s involvement in extracurricular activities.  Many extracurricular activities are not directly connected to the public school system, including civic clubs such as the Girl or Boy Scouts. Sports teams may also be organized through the community, rather than the school. Be aware of your options, and be sure to budget for the extra costs of these activities.  Even if your child isn’t a fan of extracurricular activities, they’ll surely miss their friends as they transition away from public school. Schedule periodic visits between your child and their closest friends. Make sure your child knows that they can rely on you to make these social activities a consistent part of their life.  There will almost certainly be ups and downs over the course of this transition. Tell your extended family and friends about your plans, and get ready to rely on them when you need it. There are also many online and in-person support groups for homeschooling parents that you should look into joining.  If a homeschool support group doesn’t yet exist in your area, consider starting one. There may be other parents who feel a similar need in your community, and they’ll be grateful for your efforts.

"Diagnosis of the early stages of wear is very difficult so it's important that you keep a close eye on the condition of your teeth and have regular check-ups with your dentist. Patient symptoms are the most important thing in the diagnosis of erosion so having your teeth checked will give you the best chance of an early diagnosis.;  , As well as visiting your dentist, you should take time to monitor your teeth at home and look for signs of erosion or decay. In order to prevent enamel loss you need to stick to a good dental hygiene regime, brushing and flossing twice daily.If you get into good oral hygiene habits you will be more aware of your teeth and it is more likely that you will spot signs of erosion earlier.  The most common place for wear to begin is on canine teeth in most cases. It's the best place to see the beginning signs of wear or in this case, grinding.  There are a number of symptoms of erosion and decay that you can see by observing the appearance of your teeth and their outer surface. As the enamel erodes and more of the dentin is exposed, your teeth may suffer discolouration and appear more yellow.  When you grind your teeth, the edges of your teeth may become rougher, jagged or appear more irregular, with cracks and chips.  You may notice indentations appear on the surface of your teeth. This is known as cupping and can be a symptom of erosion.  If your teeth appear very smooth and shiny this could be a symptom of grinding.A few other signs of grinding are tori (similar to callouses) formed on the outside of the upper teeth, in the gum region, and on the inside of the lower teeth in the gum region. Abfraction lesions on the sides of the teeth, linea alba (lines on the sides of the cheeks) and scalloped tongue (undulations on the sides of the tongue) are also signs that grinding occurs.  Research shows the cause of nocturnal grinding (and wearing) of the teeth is from obstructive sleep apnea, and the grinding is a sign of OSA, rather than stress.  You should also pay close attention to the potential sensory symptoms. If your teeth ache, are sore or especially sensitive, don't ignore it, as it could be a symptom of a more serious dental problem. In the early stages of enamel erosion you may experience somewhat increased sensitivity when you consume certain foods and drinks.  If sweets or hot and cold drinks cause a twinge of pain, this could indicate the early stages of of erosion at the gumline of the teeth, also known as abfractions.  In the later stages of enamel erosion, this sensitivity and pain increases significantly and your teeth may become highly sensitive to temperatures, especially cold.If you notice this twinge, act quickly and make an appointment with your dentist to try and prevent the erosion from accelerating.  ","visit your dentist regularly. monitor your teeth at home. recognize visible symptoms of erosion. pay attention to sensory symptoms of enamel loss. "
"This step saves the hassle of opening bags of candy with sticky fingers later.  ;  ,, Add powdered sugar 2 tablespoons at a time and blend the mixture with a mixer until the icing has the consistency of stiff peanut butter. The icing will secure the graham cracker walls of the house and stick the candy decorations to the surface.  Avoid regular thickness sandwich bags because the plastic is too thin and will not hold up to the punishment of being used as a pastry tube. Approximately 1 cup of icing each bag is enough. Make sure that each gingerbread artist has his or her own bag of icing.  , You now have an 'icing tube'. As you decorate, you'll squeeze the icing toward the snipped corner and use it to dispense a bead of icing on your gingerbread house.  Set four of them aside to form the roof and the two long sides of your house.  Use a gentle 'sawing' motion with a serrated knife. Use the short end of a cracker to measure the angled line from the center of the long side to the centerline of the cracker.  ,, Stick the side edge of the gable end cracker to the bead of icing on the flat side of the wall cracker. The walls should hold each other up.  Use a bead of icing along the bottom to stick the pieces to the pie tin. Also, use a bead of icing where the two walls will join at the corners.  Then, stick the flat of the roof to the top edges of the gable ends and walls. Allow the icing to set for 15 to 20 minutes before handling the house again. If you place candies on it too quickly, you risk collapsing the house.  ,  You can also use cereal for the shingles.  Look at these samples for inspiration:  A roof ridge.  A candy cane door.  Cobblestones.  A male teenager's house.  An adult's house.  Another adult's version.  A log cabin.  An additional small house.  ","separate your christmas candies into bowls. place an aluminum pie tin upside down in front of you. , combine the egg whites and lemon juice in a large bowl to make royal icing. place large spoonfuls of the royal icing into quart-size zipped style freezer bags. seal the bags. , use scissors to snip 1/4' (6 mm) off one corner of the icing filled bag. count out six whole, uncracked, unseparated, unbroken crackers. cut the two remaining cracker sheets to form end gable pieces. repeat for the second gable end. , squeeze icing along the edges of a gable end and 1 whole graham cracker. , place the long edge of the wall cracker vertical to the base edge of the gable end cracker. add the other gable end and wall in the same manner. add the roof crackers in the same manner as the wall crackers, but pipe the icing on the flat of the roof, not on the edges. line the roof with icing where you want to add shingles. , add the shingles using your chosen candies. use your imagination and decorate the entire house whatever way you like.

"The sweater can have a solid front or it can have a button-up front. It would be easier if the sweater has a V-neck, but don't worry if it doesn't; you can always add one.;  , Use a pair of fabric scissors to do this. You can also extend the cut a little bit below the armhole, but do not extend it to the front or back, or it will be too big. Don't worry if the sweater starts to unravel a little.  Add both measurements together, plus 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) for the seam allowances. You will be using this measurement to cut the ribbing for the arms., The wider you cut the strips, the wider the ribbing will be on the arm holes. You can cut the material from a matching sweater or from cotton ribbing. The colors can match, or they can contrast for an interesting look., Fold the strip in half lengthwise with the wrong sides facing in. Press it flat with an iron. Unfold the strip, then fold both of the long edges towards the center by ¼ to ½-inch (0.64 to 1.27-centimeter). Fold the strip shut, and press it flat with an iron once again.Make sure that your iron is set to a temperature appropriate for the material you are working with.  Fold both of the ends towards each other. Cut the strip at the fold so that you end up with two, equal-sized pieces., Unfold both of the strips once so that the long, side edges are still folded towards the center crease. Fold the strips in half, widthwise, with the right sides together. Sew along the narrow edges using a ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) seam allowance., Tuck each ring into each armhole until the raw edges align with the center crease. Fold the top edge down of each ring over the raw edge of the armholes, sandwiching them inside. Pin the rings in place.Align the ribbings' seams at the bottom, with the sweater's side seams.  Choose a narrow, zigzag stitch and a thread color that matches the ribbed material. Sew around the ring and armhole, about ⅛ to ¼-inch (0.32 to 0.64-centimeter) away from the inside folded edge. Be sure to sew through all layers of fabric and the remove the pins as you sew.The stitch needs to be narrow, almost a straight line. Alternatively, you can use a stretch stitch.  Tuck the iron into the sweater, and iron the back armhole on each side. Flip the sweater over, and repeat this step, ironing the front armhole. This ensures that the ribbed binding layers nicely against your sweater. It also prevents creases from forming at the shoulder and armpit.  You can eyeball it, if you'd like. If you want to be more precise, you can tuck the sweater inside an existing sweater vest, and use the existing vet's neckline as a guide. Put the sweater on and make sure that you are happy with the look.  Use a dressmaker's chalk or pen for this.  If your sweater has a ribbed collar, cut the ribbing off first, then cut the V-neck. This will help reduce bulk. If your sweater has a turtleneck, cut the turtleneck off at the seam first, then cut the V.  Avoid cutting off too much material at the side and back of the neck hole.  Be sure to add 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) to your measurement to allow for seam allowances. The strip needs to be 2 to 3 inches (5.08 to 7.62 centimeters) wide—the same width as the ribbing on the armholes.You can use the same color as you did for the armholes, or you can use a different color for something more unique. Make sure that the material matches, however!  , Fold the strip in half, lengthwise, with the wrong sides facing in. Press it flat with an iron. Unfold the strip, and fold both of the long edges in by ¼ to ½ inch (0.64 to 1.27 centimeters) towards the center crease. Fold the strip back shut, and press it flat with an iron once more.  Unfold the strip once, so that the long edges are still folded towards the center crease. Cut a V-shaped notch into each end of the strip. Make sure that the notches are aligned.Cut one side first, then use it as a guide to cut the other.  Fold the strip in half widthwise, with the right sides together. Pin the V's together. Sew along the V using a ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) seam allowance, then remove the pins., Slip the loop you made into the neck of your sweater until the raw edge touches the crease. Fold the top edge down over the raw, cut edge of your sweater's neckline. Make sure that the point of the ribbing is aligned with the point of the collar. Pin the ribbing into place.  Use a thread color that matches your material and a narrow zigzag stitch. Sew around the collar, ⅛ to ¼-inch (0.32 to 0.64-centimeter) from the inside, folded edge. Remove the pins as you sew.The zigzag needs to be narrow, almost a straight line. You can also use a stretch stitch instead.  You can now wear your sweater vest.

"Websites and books are available about the adoption process, and you can read the stories of people who were adopted.  There was nothing deficient about you then, and there is nothing deficient about you now. Giving you up for adoption might have been the best thing they could have done for you.  Maybe your mother was a busy college student who didn't have time to give a baby the love and care you deserved without dropping out of school. So she gave you a better life with a different loving family.  Or your birth family was broken and dangerous for a child, so your parents decided you deserved a better chance at a safe family life.  Or you were left with a disabled father who didn't feel he could properly care for you, so he wanted you to be with a family that could.  The adoption process is not fast or easy. You were so lovable and wanted that they felt it was worth it.  Some people want to know, and others don't care much. If you want to know, explain how you feel. If you're worried about your adoptive parent(s)' feelings, reassure them that you still consider them your real parents.  Ask your adoptive parent(s) what they know. They may or may not have met your birth parent(s), or have records on file. At minimum, adoption agencies will have wanted your parents' medical history so that you would know if various illnesses run in your family.  Ask the adoption agency, but don't get your hopes up.

"You may find it necessary to rearrange your bedroom furniture. Doing so will open up spaces that are good potential nooks. Pick a spot that's as quiet as possible. You do not want a lot of loud noises, such as a radio or TV, to disturb your peaceful little getaway., Do you want a big fluffy chair that swallows you up? Do you want a chair that you can curl up in? Do you prefer a bunch of pillows on the floor or a beanbag instead? Or do you want a woven bench that doubles as a coffee table and an ottoman?, Ample light is the perfect way to capitalize on moments of inspiration that might come to you as you read. Find a light that strikes a balance between lighting needs and your level of comfort.For daytime reading, nothing beats glorious daylight. If it gets too bright, pull across the curtains to prevent the direct sunlight from beaming onto your reading material.  For reading at night, a simple lamp will do, as long as it is adjustable. Another option is to buy a desk or floor lamp.  The most important part of a reading nook is comfort. It must be something that appeals to you and encourages you to curl up in it time after time. Think of softness and textures that delight you. Do not use anything that you do not like or that gives you a feeling of unpleasantness.  Surround yourself with the things that make you the most comfortable, such as a plushy throw or soft pillows.  Use colors, patterns and textures that make you feel safe and warm.

"Compost needs nitrogen and carbon, as well as air and water, in order to function properly so try to make sure that there is an available balance of all four components in order to keep the pile working properly., Typical carbon-based ingredients for compost include straw, leaves, cardboard, and shredded newspapers.  However, gardeners should only add black and white or grey newsprint because colored sheets may contain potentially toxic chemicals.  Add some nitrogen-based fertilizer, such as blood meal or alfalfa pellets, to the compost pile from time to time to keep it working. This is especially helpful during cold periods. Nitrogen not only generates heat, it is part of a balanced diet for all microbes.  Gardeners can also add kitchen scraps, such as vegetable peels and coffee grounds, for a higher nitrogen content if the pile stops decomposing like it should.  Where possible, compost piles should be located in sunny places, as this will increase heat and speed up the decomposition process.  Start the composting process in the garage, basement or nearby shed and eliminate some trips to the compost bin. Cooler temperatures will reduce the usual unpleasant odors. Simply place the compost materials in a large bucket or small garbage can and take them out to the compost pile once a week or whenever the container gets full.  Layer kitchen scraps between layers of “browns” or paper products to help reduce odors.  Diseased plant parts, dog manure, cat manure, coal ashes, and black walnut leaves should all be kept out of the compost pile because each of these things are known to be harmful in their own fashion.

"It is important to have a good fighting stance, but remember that a fighting stance is meant to improve your fighting and not destroy it.  Far too many martial art students are being corrupted when they are taught certain skills such as stances.  You need to realize that stances are meant to teach you the concepts behind standing a certain way. They are not supposed to be used in sparring exactly as they are taught to you! If you do this then you will look very mechanical and inhibit your ability to properly think, your mobility, your balance, your speed, and your techniques.  Remember this for your next sparring session because it will help you a lot.;  ,  A little but important detail on your fighting stance is the concept of 'lead'.  This basically means which side you prefer to keep in the front.  It is normal for fighters to keep their strong side in the back because that is what they have been taught by their instructors, but before this should even be established you need to figure out the purpose of why you are learning to fight.  Is it for sports? For self-defense? For Street fighting?  Whatever the reason you need to know that the reason most instructors teaches their students to fight with their strong side in the back is either because that's how they were taught to fight or because they are teaching competitive sports martial arts.  By keeping the strong side in the back, fighters are able to maintain their upper body strength and energy for longer periods of time than if they were to put the strong side in the front.  BUT!  If you are learning martial arts in order to defend yourself or to become better at realistic street fighting, then you should be encouraged to put the strong side in the front.  And here is why:  The front hand/leg is closer to your opponent so it will get there faster.  If the front hand/leg gets to the target faster, why not put the strong side in the front?  On the street people fight bare knuckled! Meaning that fights don't last for minutes at a time.  Footwork is very important also! If you are still not able to move around with very little effort then you have a problem because having good footwork is key to being able to throw good techniques, maintaining correct distance to your opponent, and having a good defense.  Footwork can be improved through various agility drills, regular workouts, and by teaching yourself to use explosive movements.  Many beginning martial art students have problems with staying natural after they start learning all the techniques the instructor is teaching them. This is not bad for a beginning student since it is simply caused by the absence of training, but if a student has been practicing for a couple of years and is still showing very unnatural and mechanical movements then it becomes a problem.  This student HAS to be stripped of that bad habit!  ,  It is obvious that in order to fight you will need to know the necessary techniques. Make sure that you know at least one technique for attacking straight and for attacking at an angle.  Here are a couple of examples of straight and angled attacks:  Straight:  (Punches)  Jab  Cross  Straight punch  Straight lead  (Kicks)  Straight kick  Front snap kick  Side kick  Angled:  (Punches)  Hook  Hammer fist  Back fist  (Kicks)  Roundhouse kick  ,  Simple techniques are ALWAYS better because they are more likely to work in a fight. Know this!  The shortest distance is always the better solution which means that straight techniques usually works better. By keeping this in mind you will be able to get to your target a lot faster than if you were to use angled attacks.  This brings me to another issue regarding sparring matches which is the usage of complicated and advanced techniques...  When students are sparring it is very typical to see them throw various spinning kicks or punches, but if you have been sparring for a while you should at least know by now that spinning techniques are dangerous to use.  Yes they look very cool! But they will also force you to break eye contact with your opponent AND they take a lot longer to hit the target because of the traveling distance.  Every fighter has a fighting range where they are most comfortable fighting. It is important that you train this range in order to get the advantage when you are fighting. Footwork should be used in order to keep the opponent in the preferred range to give you the upper hand.  Also remember that it is important to train the other fighting ranges that you are worse at because it is very likely that you will be forced into other fighting ranges than the one you are comfortable with.  Have you ever been in a sparring match against someone who seems to know exactly what you are going to do before you even do it? This is because your opponent have learned to read body language.  Reading body language is an important skill that HAS to be learned!  It is learned through practice and experience so if you are wondering what type of training is required to learn it, it is sparring.  Don't worry there are also other ways to learn to read body language but they are not as effective as sparring... (Go to step 12 to figure out how)  Being able to read body language will make sparring A LOT easier because it will make the fight more comprehensive.  (VERY IMPORTANT)  If you have reached the point in your training where you can't see yourself improve much further, it is time for you to start developing your own personal research. This research is the most important part of the ongoing training process that will help you create your own personal fighting method.  Researching is the only way for you to excel beyond the capabilities of your instructors! Isn't it logical that if you only learn what the instructor has to offer then you will only be able to reach the same skill level as your instructor...?  Remember! That the instructor is only there to guide you. It's up to YOU to improve beyond that point!  So how do you research....?  First you question everything you have learned!  Then you try out what you have learned in sparring to see if it really works by focusing on a single skill, technique or strategy at a time.  If a certain skill, technique or strategy doesn't work for you then you discard it!  If a certain skill, technique or strategy works for you then you keep it and try to improve it!  Then you start researching for alternative skills, techniques or strategies that you can add to your training!  Then you start the process all over again by questioning everything you have learned...  This way you will know exactly what works and what doesn't.  Remember that the only person who can tell you what works is you. We all have different strengths and weaknesses meaning that no one fights the same way.  After you have figured out which techniques works and which ones doesn't you will need to be able to put it all together in sparring. Try using as much of the above and try to make it part of your own fighting method.  Instinctive training is a type of training meant to help you be able to use what you have learned on instinct rather than trying to remember it all the time.  The reason this is important to learn is because if you have to spend to much time in a fight focusing on which techniques to use then you will get beaten.  Also if you were ever to get attacked on the street, the adrenaline in your body would only allow you to remember the techniques that are instinctive.  Some examples of instinctive training drills include having a training partner flash focus mitts at you or the partner punching at you while wearing gloves. This will teach your brain to react with a strike as soon as a target opens up or teach you to recognize punches thrown at you.  Instinctive training is basically meant as an introduction to sparring because it will allow a fighter to take it slower if he/she is still not comfortable with sparring.  It can also be used by experienced fighters to split the various skills required for sparring into segments in order to improve them individually.  Technical training is where you take the techniques you already know and work on each one of them in order to improve them even further.  There are many ways you could improve the techniques including:  Power  Muscle strength  Explosive movement  Kinetic linking  Punching through the target  Footwork  Hip/Shoulder rotation  Speed  Reaction speed  Initiation speed  Movement speed  Retraction speed  Snap motion  Non-telegraphing  ,  It is always a good idea to be in good shape for a fight no matter what type of fight it is.  Conditioning will improve your overall stamina whether it being for a sports match or for running from a street fight...  Remember than when strength training it is better to improve the muscles in a way that enhances you striking ability, don't train just to achieve a higher muscle mass because this might make your punches/kicks slower.  Try using explosive movements when training since this will HIGHLY improve your initiation speed.  Your mindset towards fighting is the highest determining factor for if you will win or not!  If you walk into a fight and don't think that you will win then you won't win... You need to tell yourself that it doesn't matter if you win or not, as long as still manage to deal some damage on the opponent. Be careful though because if you fight while angry it will make you a worse fighter so don't fight angry, fight determined instead!

"This step is especially important if your paper is a research paper. Go online, head to the library, search an academic database, or read newspapers. You can also ask a reference librarian.  Know which sources are acceptable to your teacher. Does your teacher want a certain number of primary sources and secondary sources?  Can you use Wikipedia? Wikipedia is often a good starting point for learning about a topic, but many teachers won't let you cite it because they want you to find more authoritative sources. Even if your teacher does not allow Wikipedia, you can still use Wikipedia articles as a starting point. If you have very little background knowledge about your research topic, Wikipedia can be a good place to get a general working knowledge of your research topic and find search terms. The 'Works Cited' or 'Bibliography' section at the bottom of the page can also be a good starting point for finding reliable sources. However, if your teacher forbids even that much, a normal encyclopedia can serve the same function.  Take detailed notes, keeping track of which facts come from which sources. Write down your sources in the correct citation format so that you don't have to go back and look them up again later.  Never ignore facts and claims that seem to disprove your original idea or claim. A good essay writer either includes the contrary evidence and shows why such evidence is not valid or alters his or her point of view in light of the evidence.;  , In your research you'll probably come across really well-written (and not so well-written) arguments about your topic. Do some analysis to see what makes them work.  What claims does the author make?  Why do they sound good? Is it the logic, the sources, the writing, the structure? Is it something else?  What evidence does the author present to you?  Why does the evidence sound credible? How does the author present facts, and what is his/her approach to telling a story with facts?  Is the logic sound or faulty, and why?  Why is the logic sound? Does the author back up his/her claims with examples that are easy to follow?  , Sure, you can use the arguments of others to back up what you want to say. However, you need to come up with your original spin on the topic to make it uniquely yours.  Make lists of ideas. You can also try mind mapping.  Take your time. Walk in your neighborhood or local park and think about your topic. Be prepared for ideas to come to you when you least expect them.  Look at the ideas that you generated. Choose one to three of your strongest ideas that support your topic. You should be able to support these ideas with evidence from your research.  Write a thesis statement that summarizes the ideas that you plan to present. Essentially, let the reader know where you're going and why.  A thesis statement should have a narrow focus include both your topic and what you plan to present. For example, 'Although Eli Whitney's cotton gin ushered in a new era of American prosperity, it also widened the gap in suffering for African-American slaves, who would soon be more in demand, and more exploited, than ever.'  A thesis statement should not ask a question, be written in first person ('I'), roam off-topic or be combative.  Take the thoughts that you brainstormed and assemble them into an outline. Write a topic sentence for your main ideas. Then, underneath, make bullet points and list your supporting evidence. Generally, you want three arguments or pieces of evidence to support each main idea.  Topic sentence: 'Eli Whitney's cotton gin made life harder on African American slaves.'  Ex: 'The success of cotton made it harder for slaves to purchase their own freedom.'  Ex: 'Many northern slaves were in danger of being kidnapped and brought down south to work in the cotton fields.'  Ex: 'In 1790, before the cotton gin, slaves in America totaled about 700,000. In 1810, after the cotton gin had been adopted, slaves totaled about 1.2 million, a 70% increase.'  , You do want to think about length here; don't write pages and pages if your teacher wants 5 paragraphs. However, you should freewrite to let your thoughts reveal themselves. You can always make them more concise later.  Avoid sweeping generalizations. Statements such as '______ is the most important problem facing the world today,' can cause your reader to dismiss your position out of hand if he/she disagrees with you. On the other hand, '______ is a significant global problem' is more accurate.  Don't use 'I' statements such as 'I think.' Likewise, avoid the personal pronouns 'you,' 'we,' 'my,' 'your' or 'our'. Simply stating your argument with supporting facts makes you sound much more authoritative. Instead of writing, 'I found Frum to have a conservative bias,' tell the reader why your statement is true: 'Frum displays a conservative bias when he writes...'  , Your title and introduction make people want to read your essay. If your teacher is the audience, then of course your teacher will read the whole piece. However, if you're submitting to an essay contest or writing an essay for college admissions, your title and introduction have to hook the reader if you want to meet your objectives.  Skip obvious expressions such as, 'This essay is about, 'The topic of this essay is' or 'I will now show that'.  Try the inverted pyramid formula. Start off with a very broad description of your topic and gradually narrow it down to your specific thesis statement. Try to use no more than 3 to 5 sentences for short essays, and no more than 1 page for longer essays.  Short essay example: Every year, thousands of unwanted and abused animals end up in municipal shelters. Being caged in shelters not only causes animals to suffer but also drains local government budgets. Towns and cities could prevent both animal abuse and government waste by requiring prospective pet owners to go through mandatory education before allowing them to obtain a pet. Although residents may initially resist the requirement, they will soon see that the benefits of mandatory pet owner education far outweigh the costs.'  , Summarize your points and suggest ways in which your conclusion can be thought of in a larger sense.  Answer questions like, 'What are the implications of your thesis statement being true?' 'What's the next step?' 'What questions remain unanswered?'  Your arguments should draw your reader to a natural, logical conclusion. In a sense, you are repackaging your thesis statement in your concluding paragraph by helping the reader to remember the journey through your essay.  Nail the last sentence. If your title and first paragraph make the reader want to read your essay, then your last sentence makes the reader remember you. If a gymnast does a great balance beam routine but falls on the landing, then people forget the routine. Gymnasts need to 'stick the landing,' and so do essay writers.  Get your essay done a couple of days before the due date so that you have time to go back and revise it to make it polished. Avoid turning in a first draft that you haven't double-checked for errors.  Consult a style book if you are unsure how to properly use quotation marks, colons, semicolons, apostrophes or commas. Avoid using exclamation points.  Look for mistakes involving than/then, your/you're, its/it's, etc. Make sure you know how to use apostrophes correctly.  Look for mistakes involving general punctuation. Check for run-on sentences, commas and periods inside quotation marks, as well as sparely-used dashes, colons, and semi-colons.  Vary your language with the help of a thesaurus. Also, consult a dictionary to make sure that you're using unfamiliar words correctly.  At the same time, try to keep your language short, sweet, and to the point. A thesaurus is a great tool, but don't just use big words to sound fancy. The best essays are clear, concise, and easily understood by a wide audience.  Focus on writing killer verbs for sentences. Verbs communicate the action in a sentence and drive the action. A great verb can be the difference between a bland sentence and a beautiful one.  Use adjectives lightly. Adjectives are great descriptive words, but when used indiscriminately, they can burden an essay and make it less readable. Try to let the verbs and nouns do most of the heavy lifting before you focus on adjectives.  Do not use contractions or abbreviations (e.g., don't, can't, won't, shouldn't, could've, or haven't). Your essay should have a serious tone, even if it's written in a light or lyrical style.  Does each sentence lead smoothly to the next? Does each paragraph flow logically to the next? Good connections will help your ideas to flow:  When events happen in sequence: I first started to realize that I was in the minority when I was in middle school...My realization was confirmed when I proceeded to high school.  If sentences elaborate on each other: Plants need water to survive...A plant's ability to absorb water depends on the nutrition of the soil.  When an idea contrasts with another idea: Vegetarians argue that land is unnecessarily wasted by feeding animals to be eaten as food...Opponents argue that land being used for grazing would not be able to be used to create any other kind of food.  If you're relaying a cause and effect relationship: I will be the first person in my family to graduate from college...I am inspired to continue my family's progress through the generations.  When connecting similar ideas: Organic food is thought to be better for the environment . . . local food is believed to achieve the same goals.  You don't want your essay to ramble off-topic. Any information that doesn't directly or indirectly support your thesis should be cut out.  Your ears are sometimes better than your eyes at picking up mistakes in language. The essay should sound like it has a good flow and understandable words.  If needed, rearrange sentences and paragraphs into a different order. Make sure that both your conclusion and introduction match the changes that you make to the body.  A persuasive essay is designed to sway the reader to adopt your point of view about a topic. These are good examples of persuasive essay topics you might write about:  Whether governments should or should not fund embryonic stem cell research.  Whether love is a virtue or a vice.  Why Citizen Kane is the best movie of the 20th century.  Why American citizens should be forced to vote.  When you speak in a debate, you introduce your topic, list your evidence and draw a conclusion for the people who are listening. A persuasive essay has a similar structure.  Support your argument with reasoned facts. A well-written essay is great, but a well-argued essay is undeniable.  In addition to doing research, you can perform empirical experiments including taking surveys, doing interviews or conducting experiments. Survey results or interviews could be great pieces of information to start your essay with.  Tell a story about the facts. Don't just list the facts; tell a story! For example: 'Since the death penalty has been reinstated, more than 140 inmates on death row have been released after evidence proved them innocent. Ask yourself: How would you like to be one of those 140 wrongfully-convicted inmates?'  , Present the other side of your argument and use logic and facts to show why the other side's opinion is either inaccurate or not up-to-date.For example: 'Some people argue that the death penalty acts as a deterrent to crime. Time after time, evidence has disproved this theory. The death penalty, in fact, does not act as a deterrent to crime: The South accounts for 80% of US executions and has the highest regional murder rate.'  , Be sure to stress your thesis, or what you are arguing for or against, one last time. Use some of the information you have discussed, or a story you've saved, to color your conclusion a little bit.  You'll be investigating a topic and presenting an argument about the topic based on evidence.  For example, you could write an expository essay arguing that embryonic stem cell research can lead to cures for spinal cord injuries and illnesses like Parkinson's or diabetes.  Expository essays differ from persuasive essays because you aren't stating an opinion. You're stating facts that you can back up with research.  Some common strategies and structures for expository writing include:  Definitions. Definition essays explain the meaning of terms or concepts.  Classification. Classification essays organize a topic into groups starting with the most general group and narrowing down to more specific groups.  Compare and contrast. In this type of essay, you'll describe either the similarities and differences (or both) between ideas or concepts.  Cause and effect. These essays explain how topics affect each other and how they are interdependent.  How-to. How-to essays explain the steps required for completing a task or a procedure with the goal of instructing the reader.  Expository essays aren't about opinions. They are about drawing a conclusion based on verifiable evidence. This means keeping your perspective balanced and focusing on what the facts tell you.  You might even find that, with new information, you'll have to revise your essay. If you started out writing about the scarcity of information regarding global warming, but came across a bunch of scientific evidence supporting global warming, you at least have to consider revising what your essay is about.  The facts will tell the story itself if you let them. Think like a journalist when writing an expository essay. If you put down all the facts like a reporter, the story should tell itself.  Don't mess with structure in expository essays. In narrative essays, you can twist and turn the structure to make the essay more interesting. Be sure that your structure in expository essays is very linear, making it easier to connect the dots.  A narrative essay recounts an incident that either you or others have experienced. In a narrative essay, you could describe a personal experience in which embryonic stem cell research could have helped you or someone you love conquer a debilitating condition.  You'll need an introduction, setting, plot, characters, climax and conclusion.  Introduction: The beginning. How are you going to set the story up? Is there something useful or important here that gets mentioned later on?  Setting: Where the action takes place. What does it look like? Which words can you use to make the reader feel like they are there when they read it?  Plot: What happens. The meat of the story, the essential action. Why is the story worth telling?  Characters: Who's in the story. What does the story tell us about the characters? What do the characters tell us about the story?  Climax: The suspenseful bit before anything is resolved. Are we left hanging on the edges of our seat? Do we need to know what happens next?  Conclusion: How everything resolves. What does the story mean in the end? How have things, people, ideas changed now that the end is revealed?  , Most narrative essays are written from the author's point of view, but you can also consider other perspectives as long as your point of view is consistent.  Utilize the pronoun 'I' if you are the narrator. In a narrative essay, you can use first person. However, make sure that you don't overdo it. In all essays, you sound more authoritative if you state facts or opinions in third person.  You're telling a story, but the purpose of the story is to make a specific point. Introduce your main idea in your thesis statement, and make sure that all of your story elements tie back to your thesis statement.  What did you learn? How is your essay an exploration of the things that you learned?  How have you changed? How is the 'you' that started the essay different from the 'you' now? Related to, but different from, the 'what did you learn?' question.  You will use words to evoke emotions in your reader, so choose your words deliberately.

"t’s okay to admit when you don’t know the answer or even that something had you a little scared. Children, especially older ones, can sense insincerity. Being honest with children lets them know that you are authentic and that they can trust you, which is one of the biggest part of forming a bond.It also sets an example for how you would like them to be with you.  For example, tell them that you’re honestly a little nervous about getting to know them.  If a child asks you about something difficult, traumatic, or scary that they see or hear about, then be honest and age-appropriate about the situation.;  , Although you should be honest with young children as much as possible, sometimes children will ask you things that are a little too personal, or about a topic that is too mature for their age. Sometimes they do this out of genuine curiosity, sometimes just as a “test” to see how much you will tell them.  If a child asks you something that you aren’t comfortable answering, then try saying, “that’s a conversation for another day” or, “Wow! That’s a really big question. I need some time to think about that”.  You can also say, “I'm honestly not comfortable talking about that right now.”  , Doing so sets a good example for children and strengthens your bond with them in several ways. It lets them know that you are human and relatable. It also demonstrates to them that it is okay to mess up, as well as how to handle it.  Don’t let a fear of making a mistake with or around the child stop you from bonding with them. If you make mistake, it just shows them that you are human.  For example, you might try saying, “I made a mistake. I thought I was supposed to do it this way, but I wasn’t”.  Children are known for saying things that can be insensitive, rude, and just plain mean. Taking it personally can cause you to develop resentment toward the child which would definitely prevent you from bonding. Let the child know that it is not okay, but don’t let it hurt your feelings or make you angry.  Often, especially with younger children, they don’t realize that what they are saying is hurting. Gently let them know that what they said was not okay. If needed give them another way to say it.  Older children may do it intentionally as part of acting out, or even just because they are experiencing natural hormone changes that are making them moody.  ","be honest. don’t divulge everything. admit your mistakes. don’t take it personally. "
"As before, you'll need to decide what colors you want for your bracelet. You can choose lots of different colors or just a few different colors. You'll need them in the specific loom rubber bands. You'll also need something to serve as your loom. Two pencils work the best, but you can also use your fingers. You'll also need a C or S clip to connect your bracelet together.If you use pencils, which will give you the closest thing to an actual loom, try to use dull or unsharpened ones. With sharpened pencils you risk stabbing yourself as you move the rubber bands over the looms.  If you find it too difficult to hold the pencils, you can try using your fingers. However, using your fingers might be a bit uncomfortable and it may be easier for the bands to slide off.  Take your first rubber band and twist it into an eight. Then place one loop of the eight on the right pencil and the other loop on the left.You can use double the rubber bands to create a thicker bracelet. Instead of placing just one rubber band on your pencils, you can twist two or three rubber bands into a figure eight and place them on your pencils.  As you did in the previous method, pick your next two rubber bands and place them one by one on top of your other rubber band. You will loop them around both pencils by stretching them across the outside of one pencil to the outside of the other. For a thicker bracelet, you can place three rubber bands instead of two., Using your fingers, grab the bottom rubber band, or rubber bands, and bring it (or them) up and over the top rubber bands you just placed. Take the right rubber band first, bringing it up and over the rubber bands and the top of the pencil. Then repeat on the left side.Tug on the rubber bands to readjust them and push them down lower on your pencils to keep working.  Take your next color or colors and place one or two rubber bands on your pencils (depending on how thick you want your bracelet to be). Then, bring the bottom rubber band over the top rubber band you just placed as you did in the previous step.If you are doing the simple method, using only one rubber band instead of sets of rubber bands, you should just see two loops on your pencils. Bring the bottom loop up and over the top loop on each of your pencils. If you are using multiple rubber bands to create a thicker bracelet, just make sure you are still bringing the bottom rubber bands over the top rubber bands. You should see a separation in the rubber bands by the middle loops.  Continue to repeat this process until you have your desired length. Then, attach the S or C clamp to the bottom of your chain, looping the hook through the rubber band loops., Take the rubber bands that are still wrapped around your pencils and gently pull them off, making sure you don't lose any of them. You can hold the middle rubber band loop, or you can grip the two side loops., Taking the two loops you just pulled off, stick one loop through the other loop. Then, pull the loop you just stuck through tightly, letting go of the other loop. This should create a nice knot at the end of your chain with one loop. Finally, connect that last loop to the S or C clamp and then you should have your finished bracelet!  ","gather your supplies. create a figure eight with your first band. place two rubber bands over the first rubber band. bring the bottom rubber band over the top. place the next set of rubber bands on your pencils. reach your desired length. pull the rubber bands off your pencils. tie off your rubber bands and create your bracelet.

"Take your senior dog’s health into consideration before introducing it to a new puppy. If it has a chronic health condition (e.g. diabetes or hypothyroid disease) or impaired vision, a puppy’s energy might be too much for it to handle. Consult your veterinarian if you are uncertain about your senior dog’s health limitations., Take your senior dog’s interactions with other dogs as an indication of how it will deal with a puppy. If you dog interacts enthusiastically with other dogs and puppies while on its walks, for example, there is a very good chance it will adapt well to a new puppy. If your dog demonstrates fear or aggression towards other dogs, or has a tendency to get into fights with them, take this as a sign that it might not tolerate a boisterous puppy in its environment., Monitor all initial interactions between your dogs very carefully, watching for signal from your senior dog. Things like looking away from the puppy or moving to another part of the room are obvious signs that your dog needs a break from the interaction, and these signs should be considered before your dog gets aggressive.A less obvious sign would be your senior dog licking its lips or nose in an exaggerated manner, which is likely a signal that it is anxious or uncomfortable.

"Doing a round off on a low beam (even with mats) can be challenging, so first, perfect it on a line on the floor. Here are some ways to check if your ready to try it on the low beam:  Make sure that your feet are both touching the line (not at the edge, rather center them somewhere around the middle).  Stick your landing consistently (in a row, and without mistakes).  Check to see if your hurdle is high enough. To do this, you could also hurdle against the wall, and see how high you jump; you should be able to jump half of your size (in your round off, more like two fifths).I f you don't want to do a hurdle, you definitely don't have to, unless your coach says to do so. This goes for any height of balance beam.  Make sure that your hands are on the line when you reach out for the round off.;  , Once you know that you can handle a low beam, find a low beam at your gym. Surround it with panel mats, stacked up to the height of the beam. If you're at home, you can stack pillows., Ensure that there is enough space to put your hand about 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.5cm) before the edge of the panel mat., However, this time also move forwards on the hurdle. It's good to have a strong hurdle with 'flight' (time in the air with no part of your body touching the beam), so if you're competing on this skill, the judges won't give you a deduction for no or less 'flight'., Stretch out your hands, and slightly turn like a cartwheel/dive cartwheel., Make sure you've got straight legs, straight arms, and pointed toes., However, squeeze your thighs as tightly as you possibly can. Here are some drills that could help:  Handstand hop (multiple hops)  Front handspring over vault table, or a block.  Get back onto your feet in under a second., Here are some tips to achieve this effectively:  Avoid wobbling––keep your feet still.  If you think your going to fall, just hop off, and get back on.  Put your hands in front of you to help keep your balance, and to prevent falling.  Try keeping one foot slightly in front of the other, so that you have more space for each foot.  Quickly finish, and move onto your next skill or try again.  If you have perfecting a round off on the beam with mats, now's the time to get rid of those mats. Remember that you're still doing it on the low beam, so you'll be safe if you have actually mastered the previous part., Bend your knees slightly, but soon extend out of them., Do the hurdle as before, and make it high.,, Now is the tricky part: you have to land your feet on the beam, so keep your eyes on the beam., Then, hop/push out of it.,, Remember to land gracefully. Don't be afraid to land, it's better to try., The whole world is a little different on a four inch (10cm) wide, high beam. Think of it as a low beam, but know your safety falls for forwards, backwards, and sideways.  Make sure that you have mastered the steps in the previous part. The high beam can present a high chance of slipping, so be consistent (doing it over and over without mistakes on the low beam).  If it's your first time, ask a coach to spot you. Do not attempt this without someone spotting you., Think about where your aim is for the hurdle., Keep your eyes on the beam, and your hands ready., Get ready to place your hands.,,,, Don't forget to smile!, It's worth it, it's also a great idea to just show your family; they'll be proud of you!

"There are four main attachment styles and learning about these may help you to bond with your baby. You can also consider your own traits and upbringing to determine your own attachment style. The main attachment styles are:Secure  Ambivalent  Avoidant  Disorganized;  , Teach your baby that they can trust you to take care of them by learning to interpret their signals. Pay attention to how they act when they are hungry, tired, and wet. When they need something, respond as quickly as you can.It may take you a few weeks to start understanding your baby’s cries and other cues. Keep trying, and trust yourself to get it eventually.  Babies need lots of physical contact for healthy development. Hold your baby as often as you can, and ask other people, such as your partner or a relative, to hold them when you can’t. Consider buying a sling or another type of carrier so you can keep your baby with you all the time., Smile at your baby, sing to them, and play with them often. If your baby makes noises to get your attention, respond by cooing back at them. Positive interactions tell your baby that they are important to you, which will make them feel safe and valued.Even small babies can sense when you’re impatient or unhappy, so do your best to stay warm and positive when you interact with your little one.  Also keep in mind that a lack of interaction can have negative consequences. Make sure that you do not let your baby cry for too long without holding them and providing comfort., Eye contact helps you and your baby bond. Encourage your baby to look at your face, and let them look away before you do. Smile and talk to your baby while you are making eye contact.Don’t try to force your baby to make eye contact. Looking at a person’s face can be intense for a baby, and they may not be able to do it for very long.  You don’t need to interact with your baby all the time. Infants’ nervous systems aren’t fully developed, so they can’t always handle a great deal of stimulation. If your baby acts cranky or doesn’t want to engage, they might need a break., No parent is able to know exactly what their baby wants all the time. It’s okay if you occasionally interpret your baby’s cries wrong or can’t pick them up immediately. If you do your best and keep trying to understand them, it won’t damage their attachment to you.  ","learn about the different attachment styles. read and respond to your baby’s cues. hold and touch your baby. interact warmly with your baby. make eye contact. recognize when your baby is overstimulated. don’t worry about being perfect.

"If you’re trying to get closer to a shy acquaintance and develop a friendship, chances are that you’ll have to make the first move. Ask them if they’d like to meet up sometime soon, or send them a text asking if they’re busy. Be upfront about your interest in developing a friendship and, more likely than not, it will make them feel flattered and welcoming of your overtures.If you’re in school or college, it can be an easy, no-pressure invitation to ask if they would like to go get some coffee and study or go to a campus event.  If you know one another from work, see if they’d like to go out after work for a happy hour drink.  Going out for a meal, drinks, or coffee is usually a good way to get to know someone, but these kinds of talk-heavy activities can be intimidating or high-pressure for a shy person. You can alleviate this pressure by planning activities for the first few times you hang out together: a shared activity means that neither of you has to work continuously to support the conversation. It will also create shared memories that deepen and strengthen a friendship.If you’re both sporty people, you can go for a hike or a bike ride. If one or both of you isn’t comfortable with this kind of activity, though, pick a more relaxed thing to do, such as seeing a movie or attending a community event.  A shy person already knows they're shy, so mentioning and drawing further attention to it won’t do any good. In fact, you’ll just make the person feel uncomfortably spotlighted and even attacked for something which comes innately.You want to show them that you like and are interested in them just as they are, not that you’re trying to change them and their behavior in order to suit you.  For example, avoid saying things like, 'You're so quiet! Why are you so quiet?' or 'Stop being such a wallflower! Pipe up!' If you want to encourage your shy friend open up, say something instead like, 'You always have such interesting stories, I'd love to hear more!'  If the shy person has done well by sustaining conversation for a while, give them a break. Take control of the conversation for a while or just keep the activities short and let them go.  It can take time to break down the personal defense barriers of a shy person, so don’t rush the process. Keep talking points light and impersonal until you're well-acquainted. In general, this is good etiquette with anyone, but it’s particularly important when dealing with a shy person. Touching on a sensitive personal issue or political hot-button can make the shy person feel vulnerable and retreat back into their shell, effectively undoing any progress you’ve made in the past.  A good way to develop intimacy in a friendship is to divulge a secret or something personal from your life, or to acknowledge an insecurity of your own. This self-revealed vulnerability will make the shy person feel entrusted with your intimate feelings and more likely to share something personal with you in return.Revealing your own insecurity may make the shy person feel okay about their own anxieties.  Also be sure to avoid racy or dark humor. Racial, sexual, or extremely sarcastic jokes may offend the person or make them uncomfortable, so keep your banter breezy and PG-13.  Introducing your friends to one another can be a tricky business with no established etiquette, and it's made even more difficult when you’re dealing with a shy person.Since it’s more difficult and takes longer to get to know a shy person, you might want to keep your hangout sessions one-on-one until you get more comfortable with one another. Letting other friends into the dynamic too soon can make the newcomer feel pushed out and more hesitant to open up, so wait a beat before you bring in the whole gang.  You can help facilitate this by telling this person about your friends before they meet — knowing what to expect can help them feel more comfortable.  Try introducing the person to others around you with a piece of information you learned about the person. For instance, “John have you met Allison? We were just talking about how much she loves traveling.” This will help the shy person make more connections and feel comfortable.  If you met the shy person through your larger group of friends, this is less of an issue. You should still make time for the two of you to hang out one-on-one, though, in order to cultivate a unique friendship.  While a shy person will often open up after they begin feeling comfortable with a new acquaintance, they might revert to old, reserved ways when something bad happens or they’re struggling emotionally. Be a good friend by checking in and helping them to articulate these thoughts and feelings.  The best way to get anyone to open up is to show them you're listening. Pick a time when the two of you are alone and ask, 'Hey, how have you been lately? What's been going on in your life?' If you've noticed your friend has seemed withdrawn or depressed, you can gently bring it up by saying, 'It seems like you've been a bit down recently. Is there anything you want to talk about?'Make sure your friend knows that you're available and interested in the future as well. Reassure them by saying something like, 'I'm always here to listen if you want to talk.'  ","invite the person to hang out. find activities you both enjoy. don’t tell the person to speak up. wait a while to get personal. introduce other friends gradually. check in to find out how the other person is feeling.

"This condition does not endanger your life, and will resolve itself on its own in most situations. However, it may take up to a year to resolve completely, so there are some exercises you can do to help speed up the recovery process.  Usually, the treatment for this condition when it occurs in adults is physiotherapy. It is important to see a professional because exercises that are done incorrectly could actually lead to a worsening of the condition.  One of the suggested exercises is listed below.  These exercises help strengthen pelvic floor muscles and deep abdominal muscles, which can help to resolve this condition. You can start these exercises during pregnancy and continue them after the birth, unless stated otherwise by your physician. These exercises are basically contractions and relaxations of your pelvic muscles.  First of all, you need to identify the right muscles; in order to do this you need to stop urination in midstream. The muscles that you use to do this are the muscles you must relax and contract during these exercises. After this task is complete, you need to completely empty your bladder and stay on your back, relaxed. Try to contract and relax these muscles, holding each contraction and relaxation for give seconds. Repeat this process five times a day.  Once you feel comfortable with this duration of time, you can relax and contract for 10 seconds each; do these exercises three times a day.  Some doctors believe that surgical realignment is the best way to speed up the recovery process. Others believe that surgery should only be done as a last resort if the condition does not clear up by itself over the course of a year or two, or when the diastasis recti is extremely severe.  The operation that would be performed, should you choose to have it done, is called abdominoplasty (this is also called a tummy tuck). During the surgery, your muscles will be realigned and your skin will be elevated from the pubic region to your breast bone.  ","understand that this is a self-limiting condition. set up an appointment with a physical therapist. practice kegel exercises. talk to your doctor about surgical realignment. "
"If you're suffering from morning sickness, sometimes the last thing you feel like doing is eating. However, it is important that your body gets the vitamins and nutrients it needs to keep you and your growing baby healthy.  Try to avoid an empty stomach by eating small, frequent meals throughout the day.  You should also try to eat at a slower pace than you normally would to avoid overeating, which may make you feel even worse.;  , It's extremely important that you stay hydrated, especially if you're getting sick frequently. If you let yourself become dehydrated, you will feel even more nauseated. Sip fluids throughout the day, using a straw if it helps. Try to refrain from drinking 30 minutes before or after eating, however.  You should try to drink about 6 to 8 glasses of water each day. However, if you've been getting sick a lot, you can try replacing some of the water with a sports drink containing glucose, salt, or potassium to help restore lost electrolytes.Alternatively, you can try drinking cold, carbonated beverages, as some women find these easier on the stomach. Other women also find sour drinks, like lemonade, easier to keep down.  Avoid drinking too many fluids, though. Liquids can give you a false sense of fullness which may cause you to feel less hungry throughout the day., Many women insist that crackers are a necessity when dealing with morning sickness. They make a great snack as they are portable, inexpensive and easy to digest. Keep a stash of dry crackers beside your bed and eat a few before getting up in the morning, then continue to nibble on them throughout the day.If you need to get up to use the bathroom in the middle of the night, try eating a cracker or two then as well. They'll help stave off hunger and settle your stomach before the morning.It doesn't matter what kind of crackers you eat, saltines, wheat thins, rice cakes - it's a matter of personal preference. If you're not a cracker fan, try eating dry cereal instead.  Avoid coating your crackers in greasy butter or fatty spreads, they may make you feel more unwell and are harder to digest. Eat the crackers dry, if possible.  Stick to bland foods as much as possible when dealing with morning sickness. They smell less strongly and are easy to digest.  Do your best to avoid spicy, acidic, and fried foods, as these are more likely to upset your stomach.  Try the BRAT diet, which consists of bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast. These foods are bland and low in fiber and thus gentle on your digestive track. They are also very inexpensive.You can also add tea and yogurt to the list to go on the BRATTY diet.  After a while, you will start to notice that certain foods or smells will trigger your nausea. It may be pizza, bacon or anything at all. Once you know your triggers, you can take steps to avoid them.Try making a note of when and why you feel queasy every day, in order to identify your food triggers.  Indulge your cravings, especially if it helps you to feel better. If you have a craving for a particular food, your body may be trying to tell you something. If you are craving dairy, perhaps you need calcium. If you are craving peanut butter, perhaps you need protein or more calories., A lot of women find carbohydrate-filled foods the most appealing when feeling nauseated. Stock up your cupboards with carbohydrate-rich pasta, bread, pretzels and granola bars., Some women find that high protein foods help to ease their morning sickness. Whether it's scrambled eggs, peanut butter, or a lean piece of meat, try to find a protein-rich food that works for you., Try to eat your food either cold or at room temperature, because food tends to have a more pervasive smell when heated, and strong aromas can be major triggers for morning sickness.Stick to sandwiches, fruit and raw vegetables, and salad (when it's properly prepared to prevent listeria).  Fatty foods take longer to digest and can be rough on your digestive system, which can worsen feelings of nausea.They are also less healthy, providing fewer nutrients than other types of foods and have a tendency to smell quite strongly, which isn't good. Avoid!  , Brush your teeth thoroughly and swirl some mouthwash after you eat. This will prevent odors and tastes from hanging around your mouth after eating. Get your partner to brush his teeth too, while you're at it. Nothing like a pepperoni pizza breath kiss to trigger your gag reflex.  You should avoid lying down for at least 30 minutes after eating, as the horizontal position can interfere with digestion and lead to queasiness.  ","eat small, frequent meals. drink lots of fluid. snack on crackers. stick to bland food. avoid foods and smells that trigger your nausea. listen to your cravings. eat carbohydrates. eat high-protein foods. eat cold food. avoid fatty foods. brush your teeth. avoid lying down after eating.

"In order to prevail in a lawsuit for an infringement on your right of publicity, you will have to prove certain elements that have been laid out by the legislature and/or the courts. Some states will have a statute laying out the cause of action, while other states may have judge-made law that lays out the cause of action. Check with your local laws to determine what you will have to prove. In California, for example, there is both a statutory and common law (i.e., judge made law) right of publicity.  Under California statutory law, you would have to prove that (1) there was a knowing use of your identity, (2) the use was for advertising purposes, and (3) there was a direct connection between the use and the commercial purpose.  Under California common law, you must prove that (1) the defendant used your identity, (2) your name was used to the defendant's advantage (commercial or otherwise, (3) there was no consent on your part, and (4) you were injured.  In California, you can simultaneously pursue both causes of action.;  , Someone violates your personality rights when they use your name or likeness for a commercial purpose.For example, someone could take a picture of you and use it in an advertising campaign. You can sue if the company does not get your permission.  Gather examples of your name or likeness appearing in any newspaper or magazine article. If your image was used in an online advertisement, then create screen captures or print them off.  Realize, however, that you can’t sue for all uses of your name or likeness. For example, if you are a celebrity or a politician, then someone can write a biography or newspaper article about you because it is newsworthy. Newsworthiness is always a defense, so you should be aware whether or not your likeness was used as part of a news story.  Your image might have appeared in a television advertisement or other visual media. Try to record the video and preserve it. If it appears online, then download the video.  Non all exploitation has to be for commercial benefit of the person using your name or likeness. So long as the person benefits in some way from appropriating your identity, you can sue.For example, a university professor created non-commercial websites and email accounts that contained the names of several former colleagues. He then sent emails to different universities under the pretense of nominating them for jobs. In his emails, he redirected people to his website which contained negative information about his former colleagues. A court held that this professor misappropriated the likenesses of his colleagues.  If you are unsure about whether you can sue over a particular use of your name or likeness, then gather all evidence and show it to a lawyer.  An experience lawyer can tell you whether you have a valid case. The lawyer can also bring the lawsuit if you decide to hire them. At a minimum, you should schedule a half hour consultation with the lawyer to discuss your situation.  You can find a qualified lawyer by contacting your local or state bar association, which should run a referral program. You can find your nearest bar association by visiting the American Bar Association website and clicking on your state., You can technically sue for any violation of your personality rights. However, that doesn’t mean that you should. Lawsuits are long and expensive. If you don’t have a lawyer, you might save on legal fees but you will still spend a considerable amount of time appearing in court, gathering evidence, and learning the law. For this reason, you should discuss at the consultation whether bringing a lawsuit is worth your time.  Analyze whether you have a strong case. You should discuss with the lawyer whether the person who appropriated your likeness has any defenses. You shouldn’t sue if your case is weak.  Consider whether the person who appropriated your likeness has any resources to pay you.It’s one thing to win a lawsuit but quite another to try and collect on your money judgment. If the person who used your likeness is a small business, then you might not want to sue. However, if a large publishing company or media conglomerate appropriated your likeness, then you should sue.  Consider whether bringing a lawsuit will deter other people from appropriating your likeness. If you are a celebrity, for example, you might want to sue simply to warn other people not to appropriate your likeness. Bringing a couple of lawsuits—even if you lose money—could save you money in the long run.  In a right of publicity case, you will be able to ask the court to award you actual damages, the defendant's profits, punitive damages, and attorneys' fees. Also, you may be able to ask the court to take into consideration the injury to your peace, happiness, feelings, goodwill, and professional standing.  Your actual damages is the amount of money you actually lost because the defendant used your personality. For example, if you lost out on other jobs because of this, you would be able to collect those lost earnings.  The defendant's profits is the amount of money the defendant made off of you because they used your likeness.  Punitive damages may be awarded when there has been oppression, fraud, or maliciousness. Punitive damages are meant to punish the defendant for their actions.  Some states, and possibly the federal government, might allow you to collect attorneys' fees if you are successful in your case. In California, for example, attorneys 'fees are required to be paid by the losing side., You have a couple options for where you bring your lawsuit. First, you will have to decide whether to sue in federal or state court. If your state doesn’t have a law prohibiting misappropriation of likeness, then you will have to sue in federal court.  You can bring right of publicity claims under the federal Lanham Act.If you sue in federal court, you can tack on any state law claims as well.You can certainly represent yourself in federal court though, as a general rule, it may be more complicated. Federal court is ideal when a lot of money is at stake and each side has a lawyer.  You should try to bring your case in federal court whenever possible. While some state courts may be well equipped to take these types of cases (i.e., California), most state courts will have trouble with these causes of actions. In addition, federal courts often have more robust discovery phases, which will be important when you need to learn the extent of your damages.  You start the lawsuit by filing a complaint in court. This document identifies you as the “plaintiff” bringing the lawsuit and the person you are suing as the “defendant.” In the complaint, you explain how the defendant appropriated your name or likeness without your permission. You also make a claim for relief, which is usually money compensation (“damages”).If you have a lawyer, he or she should draft the complaint for you. If you don’t have a lawyer, then you should ask the court clerk if there is a printed “fill in the blank” complaint form you can use. Small claims courts in particular have these forms.  After completing the complaint, you should make several copies. Take the original and the copies to the court clerk. Ask to file the original.  You will probably have to pay a filing fee, which varies by court. If you can’t afford the fee, then ask for a fee waiver form and fill it out.Have the clerk stamp your copies of the complaint with the filing date as well.  The person you sue must have notice of the lawsuit. You can provide this notice by sending a copy of your complaint and a “summons,” which you can get from the clerk. The summons tells the defendant how much time he or she has to answer the lawsuit.  Your lawyer will arrange service. However, if you are representing yourself, then ask the clerk for what methods of service are appropriate.  Generally, you can serve notice by hiring a private process server to make delivery for a small fee (usually $45-75). In other courts, you can pay the sheriff to make service or have someone 18 or older make hand delivery, provided they are not a party to the lawsuit., Whoever makes service should fill out a “proof of service” or “affidavit of service” form.You can get it from the court clerk. By completing this form, the server testifies that he or she made service on the defendant.  The server typically returns the form to you after filling it out. You should make a copy and file the original with the clerk.  The defendant will probably respond to your lawsuit by filing an “answer” with the court. In this document, the defendant responds to each allegation you made in the complaint. Typically, the defendant admits, denies, or claims insufficient knowledge to admit or deny each allegation.Read the answer closely. The answer should provide the first sneak peek as to what the defendant’s defense will be.  If you have a lawyer, then the complaint will be sent to your lawyer and not you. Nevertheless, you should request a copy of all documents filed in your case.  After the defendant responds to your lawsuit, the case enters a fact-finding phase. This is called “discovery.” The purpose of discovery is for each side to request information from the other side so that you can understand what evidence will be presented at trial.As the plaintiff, you can also request documents that help strengthen your case.  For example, you might not know the full extent of the defendant’s appropriation of your likeness. You can submit a Request for Production for a copy of any use of your name or likeness. The defendant will then have to hand over copies to you. In this way, you could uncover that the defendant used your likeness in more advertisements than you were originally aware of.  During discovery, each side can also ask witnesses questions in a “deposition.” Depositions take place in a lawyer’s office with a court reporter present.You might have to give a deposition, and you should certainly ask the defendant to sit for one.  For example, the defendant might claim that you consented to the use of your likeness, which is a defense. You can use the deposition to figure out what facts the defendant thinks constitute consent.  Any statement given in a deposition can be raised at trial, so your lawyer can use the deposition to “lock in” the defendant to a story. If the defendant starts to tell a different story at trial, your lawyer can raise the inconsistent statement the defendant made in the deposition. This is a good way to undermine the defendant’s credibility at trial.  After the close of discovery, the defendant might try to win the lawsuit before going to trial. He or she can file a “motion for summary judgment.” These motions are appropriate only if no facts are in dispute and the law clearly favors the defendant.Your lawyer will probably defend against the summary judgment motion by arguing that meaningful facts do remain in dispute for a jury to decide. For example, you might have had a conversation with the defendant which the defendant claims represents your consent. However, you don’t think what you said can be interpreted as consent.  Because of how long lawsuits can be, you might want to try and negotiate or mediate a settlement outside of court. You should discuss with your attorney whether settlement would be ideal. Consider the following factors:  The strength of your case. If you have a strong case, you might only settle if the defendant can pay you close to the amount you are suing for. By contrast, if your case is weak, you might want to settle for far less.  If the defendant will apologize. One benefit of settling a case is that you can craft your own remedies. For example, you might want the defendant to issue a public apology. A court can’t order a defendant to apologize, but you could negotiate an agreement where he or she does. Talk with your lawyer about whether there are unconventional remedies you want to pursue during settlement.  As you prepare for trial, you should fully understand what you need to prove. Understanding the different elements of your claim will help you decide what evidence to present at trial. To win your case, you will need to prove:The defendant used a protected attribute. This could be your name, likeness, voice, etc. You can prove this element by introducing examples of the advertisement or use.  The defendant used your attribute for an “exploitative” purpose. In other words, the defendant tried to get some benefit from using your likeness. If the defendant used your image for commercial benefit (such as in an advertisement), then this element is easily proved.  You did not consent. Consent is also a defense. You will need to testify at trial that you didn’t consent to the specific use of your likeness.  If you have a lawyer, then he or she will gather all of your evidence in preparation for trial. If you are representing yourself, then you should do the following to prepare:  Draft your list of witnesses. You might have people testify on your behalf. You usually have to give the defendant your list of witnesses before trial. You should ask someone to testify on your behalf only if that person has personal knowledge of the facts they are testifying to.For example, if someone found an advertisement that used your picture, then you should have that person testify that they saw the image, recognized you, and sent you the advertisement.  Create exhibits. Any document you want to use at trial needs to be turned into an exhibit. You should get exhibit stickers from the court clerk or an office supply store. Affix the sticker to a corner of the document.If you are introducing a picture into evidence, put the sticker on the back of the picture.  Make copies of the exhibits. You have to give the defense and the court a copy of the exhibit. You also will need to show the witness a copy of the exhibit on the witness stand. Accordingly, you should make at least four copies of everything.  You will probably be nervous, especially if you have never participated in a trial before. To prepare, you should find a trial at the courthouse where you will be appearing. Ask the court clerk if there is any you can observe. Courtrooms are generally open to the public., Either you or the defendant can request a jury trial. If you want a jury, then request it in your complaint. If you are in small claims court, then you might not be able to have a jury (though it depends on the court). Jury selection is called “voir dire.”During “voir dire,” the judge will call up a panel of potential jurors and ask them basic questions (about their jobs, hobbies, etc.) If you think a juror cannot be unbiased, then you should ask the judge to dismiss the juror “for cause.”  You will also have a certain number of “peremptory” challenges. With these, you can excuse the juror without having to give the judge a reason. The only limitation on using peremptory challenges is that you can’t discriminate on the basis of race, gender, or ethnicity., If you have a lawyer, he or she will handle the whole trial. You will only testify. However, if you are representing yourself, then you might need to make an opening statement. Try to keep it brief. The purpose of the opening statement is to give the judge and jury a roadmap of the evidence you will present., You can call your witnesses first. If you have to ask them questions, then make sure not to ask leading questions. A leading question contains its own answer and can typically be answered with a “yes” or “no.”For example, “You saw my name and face in a used car ad, didn’t you?” is a leading question. Instead, ask a series of general questions to elicit the same information:  “Do you read any newspapers?”  “Which ones?”  “And how often do you read it?”  “Did you read it April 2, 2015?”  “What did you see?”  , The defendant gets to go second to present witnesses and introduce documents or other exhibits. You will have a chance to cross-examine the witnesses.  If you are representing yourself at trial, then read Question Witnesses when Representing Yourself for tips.  After all evidence has been submitted, you will be able to make a closing argument. The purpose of the argument is to draw together all of the evidence and show how it supports your case.  Be sure to remind the jury of any exhibits you used. For example, if you have a full-page commercial advertisement with your face plastered on it, then be sure to hold it up to the jury during your closing argument.  The judge will read the jury its instructions and then allow them to retire for deliberations. If you are in small claims court, then the judge might just deliver the verdict from the bench after all evidence has been submitted.  In many state courts, the jury no longer needs to be unanimous. However, a jury must still be unanimous in federal court., If you lose, you might want to appeal. You should talk this over with your lawyer. An appeal can be time-consuming; many take a year or longer to resolve.  However, if the judge made an obvious mistake, then you could appeal and get a new trial. Depending on the amount of money at stake, you might want another shot to win at trial.  If you brought a small claims case, then you might not be able to appeal.

"Before waxing a trap, you should make sure that it is free from grease, blood, dirt, rust, and other contaminants.  Scrub away contaminants using soap and hot water. Rinse well before proceeding further.  For rusty or extremely grungy traps, allow them to soak in undiluted vinegar for several hours. Scrub away any remaining rust with a steel wire brush.  Allow the trap to dry outside for approximately one week. A light coating of rust should form on the surface of the trap.;  , Dyeing is another procedure used to protect traps. If you choose to dye and wax the trap, you must dye the trap before coating it with wax.Place a heat-resistant brick inside the dye pot to prevent the trap from touching the bottom of the pot. The springs of the trap may weaken if directly exposed to the heat.  Mix 1 lb (450 g) of logwood dye into 3 to 5 gallons (12 to 20 L) of water. Bring the dye mixture to a rolling boil over a burner, then reduce the heat so that the dye drops to a mild simmer.  Lower the trap into the dye and allow it to stay in the simmer liquid for one hour.  Remove the trap and allow it to dry completely before waxing it.  Carefully place a nail in between the jaws of the trap to keep them open throughout the waxing process.This step will allow the wax to coat the inside of the trap, thereby protecting it more thoroughly.  Another option is to wax the trap once it is already set so that all parts will be submerged. Doing this can be rather dangerous, however, since triggering the spring can cause the trap to close without warning and injure you.  Insert a thin, sturdy piece of metal rebar through the chain of the trap. This bar must be able to support the weight of the trap without assistance.  Select a piece of rebar that is longer than the mouth of the pot you plan to use for waxing. The bar will need to rest on top of the pot without slipping in.  You may need to readjust the position of the rebar later, but for now, position it somewhere within the top few links of the chain.  Odorless trap wax is the best option to use and is specifically manufactured for this purpose.  The next best option is refined trapping beeswax. When using this, you should also add an equal amount of paraffin wax to the melting pot to help regulate the temperature.  Unscented paraffin wax can be used alone, as well, but keep in mind that it has a lower boiling point than most trap waxes.  Do not use straight beeswax without adding paraffin wax. Beeswax is brittle and will likely dry unevenly when used alone.  Place 5 lbs (2250 g) of wax into a small pot with tall sides. Heat the wax in a deep fryer until it is completely melted.Do not add any water to the wax. The wax will actually stick to the trap more effectively without the addition of water.  If you do not have a deep fryer that can be used for waxing traps, place the wax in a small pot with deep sides and melt it over an open flame. Temperature is easier to control with a deep fryer, but an open flame will still work.  Keep the wax in a liquid state throughout the entire process, but do not allow the wax to get much hotter than that. Wax can burst into flames if it becomes too hot.  Slowly submerge the prepared trap into the melted wax. Allow it to remain in the wax for several minutes.  The metal of the trap must have ample opportunity to heat up. If it does not get hot enough, the wax may not dry smoothly or evenly.  Hold the rebar as you lower the trap into the wax. If you do not want to hold the trap as it sits in the wax, carefully rest the rebar on the mouth of the pot.  Do not allow the trap to rest on the bottom of the pot. The springs can become damaged if they touch the bottom of the hot melting pot.  Pick up the rebar attached to the trap chain and carefully lift the trap out of the hot wax. Hold it above the pot for several seconds to allow the excess liquid wax to drip off the wax and back into the melting pot.  If the metal trap reached hot enough temperatures, the excess wax should drop off the trap and look as clear and fluid as water.  Hang the trap outside for several hours. The wax should cool and dry completely before you handle it any further.  Do not hang the trap in an area polluted by strong odors.  The wax should dry as a light, even coating. If the wax is chunky or thick when it dries, you may have removed the traps too soon.  Store the traps in plastic containers until you plan to use them.  Surround the traps with several layers of local leaves or branches. Doing so will imbed the wax with a natural odor, making it less noticeable to wildlife once set.  Handle the traps while wearing gloves to prevent your scent from seeping into the wax.  ","clean the trap. consider dyeing the trap. separate the jaws. insert a bar through the chain. select the wax. melt the wax. submerge the trap in the wax. slowly remove the trap. allow the trap to dry. store carefully until use.

"This means, stop using the transpose button gradually, until not using it becomes the new normal for you.;  , It is helpful to write out these tools using solfa notation, as this will make it easy to transcribe to other keys.  Choose one key per week, then at the end of the week, rehearse everything you have practiced. Note the difference between practice time and rehearsal time. In practice time, you are learning new material, while in rehearsal time, you are revising the material you already learnt.  Also, when practicing, be sure to have your fingers as relaxed as possible, as this would help improve on speed and accuracy, though much focus should be placed on accuracy  , What doesn't kill you only makes you stronger.  For example, if you are learning Key C on a certain week, move over to Key F or Key G the next week. The reason for this is because keys a perfect fourth interval apart are very much similar, with a difference of only one extra black note. For example, if you're moving from Key C to Key F, there is only one added black note which is A#.  Include all the inversions of the key you're learning.  Practice their inversions of the key.  Examples are the 2-5-1, 7-3-6, 7-3-6-2-5-1, b5-7-3, and 5-1-4.  In about two months, with some level of discipline and consistency, you should be able to break out of the transpose comfort zone.  ","break out of your comfort zone. write out everything you know on your favourite key including chords, scales, chord structures, scale patterns, and licks. devote at least two hours daily to practice. practice until you have developed muscle memory (you can play it without much effort). don't be afraid of mistakes. as you move from one key to another, do this in perfect fourths or fifths. practice all the triads (major, minor, diminished and augmented). practice the seventh chords (maj.7, min.7, dim.7, dom.7, etc). afterwards, begin to learn standard progressions and their substitutions on each key, one at a time. begin to incorporate all the licks you already know on your favourite key into all other keys, one by one.

"Typical non-vegan cake baking ingredients include eggs, butter, milk and even refined white sugar, which is manufactured with animal bones.;  ,  Most non-vegan cake ingredients such as eggs and butter can be easily replaced with typical household grocery items. For example, bananas and applesauce replace eggs and margarine replaces butter.  One egg can be replaced with 2 tbsp. ground flax seed stirred into 3 tbsp. of water.  Replace a single egg by mashing half of a banana or using 3 tbsp. applesauce. 1 egg may also be replaced with 1/4 cup (59.14 ml) of soft tofu that's been run through a blender.  Buy a vegan egg replacement product. This non-dairy powdered mix is usually found in health food stores.  Soy and almond milk are the most recommended replacements when baking. You can also use hemp, coconut, or hazelnut milk.  Use the same measurements when substituting dairy milk with vegan replacements.  Be sure that the margarine you use is not made with animal-based ingredients. Health food stores usually carry 100 percent vegan margarine.  Another option for replacing butter with a vegan ingredient is vegetable shortening or applesauce, which can replace up to 3/4 of the total butter used in any baking recipe.  These include granulated cane sugar and date sugar as well as new plant-based sweeteners. Granulated cane sugar may be used in the same proportion as refined sugar. If using date sugar or a plant-based sweetener, use less amounts in the recipe than refined sugar. These products are far sweeter than typical refined sugar.  Liquid sweeteners such as barley malt and maple syrup can also be used but be sure to slightly reduce the use of other liquids in your cake recipe.  Vegans prefer to use non-refined flours made with barley, brown rice, potato and Kamut, which are found in health food stores.  Alternatively, you can ground 1 cup (236.5 ml) of whole rolled oats to create 3/4 cup (177.4 ml) of oat flour.  For a vegan cake frosting, replace the use of butter with blended tofu and cooking oil or margarine.  ","review the recipe to determine the non-vegan ingredients. search your pantry for items that make good substitutes for the non-vegan cake ingredients. omit the use of eggs from the recipe and replace with a comparable ingredient. replace any milk used in the cake recipe with non-dairy alternatives. substitute butter with equal amounts of a vegan butter alternative, such as margarine. choose a vegan sugar substitute, which is generally healthier than refined brown and white sugars. replace refined white flour with healthier alternatives. make the frosting.

"If you already made one and stored it in the fridge, remove it so it can warm up to room temperature. If not, make a cold brew as described, but stop short of straining the liquid. Let the rice sit in the water instead and cover the bowl., Allow the rice water to ferment anywhere from 12 to 48 hours. Uncover and smell the contents periodically. Once it begins to smell sour, consider it fermented. Expect the time needed for this to vary depending on the exact temperature, plus whether or not the liquid has been strained.An unstrained mixture should ferment in 12 to 24 hours.  Strained liquid will take between 24 and 48 hours.  Higher room temperatures will reduce the amount of time needed.  First, strain the liquid if you haven’t already done so. Transfer the liquid to a pot or saucepan. Raise the heat to medium-high. Bring the water to a boil to cease the fermentation.Boiling the water after fermentation is often recommended, but not strictly required.  If you intend to use it right away, allow the water to cool first to avoid scalding. Otherwise, transfer it to a sealable container. Store in the refrigerator.Expect fermented water to pack a punch. Dilute the fermented rice water with plain warm water as desired when you use it.  ","make a cold brew. let the rice water sit at room temperature. boil the water. use or store your rice water. "
"Dump out the ants and remaining contaminated food. Immediately close the bag and take outside. This helps keep the ants from crawling back out and getting back into the food., Ants leave pheromones behind that attract more ants, so make sure to thoroughly wash out the bowl with hot water and detergent. If the bowl is dishwasher friendly, you can put it through your dishwasher., After removing the ants, clean the area around the food. You have to remove the pheromone trail so ants from the colony won't return. Try using vinegar or lemon juice to erase the scent and deter future ants from approaching.You can also mop the area around the food container, or the entire kitchen floor. You can use what you normally use to mop, or use dish soap., Look for a shallow container that is wider than the cat food bowl. You can use a silver tray, a cake pan, a pie pan, a roasting tray, or anything else that will fit the cat bowl in.Make sure the container you put the cat bowl in isn't too big. However, there should be about an inch between the edge of the moat and the food bowl. This distance helps keep ants away.Some companies manufacture bowls that already incorporate the moat around the bowl's edge. These are great and easy to use and the entire bowl can be picked up and cleaned in one go. However, if you don't want to spend the money on that before seeing if it works, you can try this DIY method.  Place a small amount of water in the moat container. You don't want to fill it too high so it spills into the food, but want enough water to provide a barrier for the ants. Ants aren't good swimmers, so it should drown or deter the ants from crossing.To help keep ants from crossing the water, try placing some vegetable oil, lemon essential oil, or dishwashing soap into the moat water. But only add dishwashing liquid if the space between the moat and food bowl is too small for the cat to drink from., Put the food bowl in the water. Make sure there is at least a 1-inch space between the edge of the moat and the food bowl. Fill the food bowl with fresh food.  If the container is extra large, put the food bowl close enough to its edge so your cat will be able to reach the food without difficulty, but far enough from the edge the ants won't be able to hop across.  If the food bowl is too short, use a block or other item to raise the food bowl above the edge of the moat container., The water may contain some drowned ants or spilled food. It will need refreshing as it begins to evaporate.  Eventually, the ants will stop coming. In some places, like in warmer climates, you may have to feed your cat in this manner persistently as the ants never go away.

"Many dog trainers believe that excessively anxious, excitable, or frightened dogs are the direct result of insufficient training. You must reinforce positive behavior when training your dog. Teach it to not get anxious at the vet, excitable at the dog park, or frightened by thunderstorms. Do this by offering an alternative task to focus on and then rewarding it when it completes the task successfully.For example, during a trip to the veterinarian’s office, if you dog gets overly anxious in the waiting room, tell it to “sit” or “lay down”. Really any basic command will do. Then reward your dog after they’ve successfully followed your command. This will reinforce the training and take your dog’s mind off of the stressful situation. In the future, your dog may even associate the waiting room of the vet with sitting and receiving a treat, not with being probed by a stranger., Your dog thinks of you as a member of its pack. If he sees you anxious or fearful, he will adopt a similar emotional state. If you find yourself in an unsettling situation, don’t let it show. Take deep breaths and count them, exhaling slowly and deliberately.  For example, if you take your pet to the vet for an operation and you’re stressed about it, don’t let your dog see it. You want to always create a positive experience for your dog in these situations. Alternatively, if you shriek every time you hear a thunder clap, your dog will think there is something to fear. This will cause anxiety too., Pheromones are chemical messengers given off by a dog’s mother during nursing to reassure her pups that they are safe and secure. Synthetic versions of this chemical, known as Dog Appeasing Pheromones (DAPs) are available for purchase as many pet superstores. Simply plug them into the wall or attach them to your dog’s collar and watch them calm your canine companion., Zylkene contains a protein extracted from milk that acts as a calming agent — like diazepam.

"The locust pose is a 'baby backbend' – a deceptively simple pose that can be quite challenging. This pose can be good to move into after dolphin plank pose, and can be added to a flow of poses with dolphin and dolphin plank.  Start locust pose by lying flat on your belly. You may want to put a folded blanket under your ribs and pelvis to provide some padding. Rest your arms along your sides with your palms up and turn your toes towards each other.  As you exhale, lift your upper torso, arms, legs, and head away from the floor, so that your body weight is resting on your belly and pelvis. Reach through your legs, firming up your buttocks and legs. Your arms should be parallel to the floor, stretching back through your fingertips.  Keep your gaze straight ahead, taking care not to crunch the back of your neck or jut out your chin. You can clasp your hands behind you above your lower back to deepen the stretch in your chest.  Hold the pose for 30 seconds to a minute, breathing deeply, then exhale and release slowly back down to the floor.  Since you start downward facing dog from your hands and knees, it's a good pose to do after the locust pose. You also can do downward facing dog directly after your dolphin plank pose.  Walk your hands forward slightly, so they're just in front of your shoulders. Press your palms firmly into the mat and spread your fingers.  Tuck your toes in, and on exhale lift your hips up and back into downward facing dog pose. Your body should take the form of an upside-down 'V' with your toes and palms supporting your weight.  Bend your knees a little to lengthen your spine, and with each exhale try to straighten them a little more. Your back should be a straight line from your hips down to your head. Pull through your heels to straighten your legs.  Keep your shoulder blades pressed down and back along your spine. Your upper arms and shoulders should be rotated outward while your forearms pull inward to stabilize your upper body.  Child's pose is a relaxing pose to add to the end of any yoga routine. The gentle pose increases flexibility in your hips and back while giving you a chance to relax in a completely stable position on the floor.

"Baseball writing, as a career, is not for every baseball fan. A successful baseball journalist must love more than just baseball. Twin passions for baseball and writing are necessary to break into the industry.An enthusiasm for baseball alone will not be enough. You'll also need a talent and genuine love for writing to be a success., To land your dream job as a baseball writer for a big magazine, newspaper, or television station, you will, in all likelihood, have to move to another city. In developing your career, you may have to move multiple times.  When you start looking into jobs, look into the media organizations you would most like to work for. Where are they located? Would you be willing to move there for the right offer?, Baseball writers have to work very hard during baseball season. If you get a job covering major league baseball, expect baseball to become your life, at least during the season.You will work long hours and have little free time to enjoy other pursuits.  You should also expect to work major holidays during baseball season, such as the 4th of July, rather than enjoying them with friends and family.  During the season, you will also need to travel extensively with the team you cover. You will often need to be away from home for periods of two weeks or more., If, after considering all of these factors, this sounds like a job you want, work hard and make it happen. For the right person, being a baseball writer is the best job in the world.

"Mineral extraction usually occurs at some time in the future as equipment and employees are often scheduled years in advance. If you do not start mining or drilling operations before the expiration of a lease, then all rights to the property and the minerals reverts back to the owner.Oil and gas have the ability to cross property boundaries underground. Some states require drilling companies to specify how oil and gas royalties will be shared among adjacent property owners., There is usually no guarantee that gas or oil will be present, so it would be to your advantage to pay a smaller amount for a lease rather than purchasing outright that will cost more. A lease gives you the right to test the property for minerals., Speculators buy the property with the goal to sell the mineral rights to another company who will do the actual production. It is an opportunity to acquire valuable property from individual owners and sell those properties to mining companies for a higher price than what you paid., In an option transaction a property owner is offered a small amount of money today for the option of buying the property at a certain price before a specified date in the future. You would then quickly try to find someone who will pay an even higher price, purchase the property from the owner, and then sell the buyer your mineral rights. If you fail to pay the specified price by the expiration date of the option, the property owner keeps the option payment., Companies such as Patriot Royalties do all the purchasing of mineral rights and the mining. Investors receive monthly income, and you don’t pay taxes on 15% of the production from a well.  Like other assets, oil and gas royalties can be bought, sold or transferred. The royalty income lasts for as long as the well produces, which may be several decades.  Most mining and drilling activity is regulated by state law. These laws may restrict extraction or require additional expenses, so make sure you are familiar with all regulations relating to extracting the minerals. Also, consider that laws may change or new laws and regulations may be passed which impact your ability to extract minerals.  Note that if you are merely receiving royalties and are not the majority owner of the mineral rights, you have no say in the production schedule. If the majority owner decides prices are too low, they may cease production at any time, which will stop the flow of royalties.  ","determine the advantages of buying vs. leasing mineral rights. lease rather than purchase gas and oil rights. purchase the mineral rights as a speculator. purchase mineral rights as an option. invest in oil and gas royalties. familiarize yourself with local and state laws.

"Use warm water to rinse out all traces of soap. If any shampoo remains in your dog's coat while you blow dry it, the soap can cause dryness and skin irritation.Make sure that the water is warm, not hot.  Since poodle hair is so dense, it can take a long time for water to thoroughly saturate it. It is crucial that you do not rush the process and patiently make sure that all traces of shampoo are out of the coat before proceeding further.  Avoid spraying the poodle's eyes with water and do not let any of the suds get into the dog's eyes, either. You may wish to protect the poodle's eyes by applying a thin coat of petroleum jelly or mineral oil around the outer perimeter of the eye.  You may have to “knead” the poodle's coat as you rinse it to make sure that all traces of shampoo are scrubbed out.;  , After washing your poodle with water and dog shampoo, consider applying a dog conditioner to the coat. The conditioner will improve the health of your dog's coat and will make the blow drying process easier.  Follow the instructions on the dog conditioner regarding proper application. Some conditioners should be left in, while others will need to be rinsed out.  You could also opt for a detangler spray instead of a conditioner. Detangler will not offer the same overall health benefits for the poodle's coat, but it will still make combing and drying the coat easier.  Gently brush your dog's wet coat with a slicker brush to remove any knots that developed during bath time.  A slicker brush is a special type of brush that has thin metal wire tines poking up from a foam or rubber base. The design of the brush makes it easier to remove tangles and dead clumps of loose hair.  Note that you could also use a large plastic comb during this stage. The comb will help you remove large knots but may not remove as many fine tangles as a slicker brush would.  Wring out as much moisture as possible from the longest parts of your poodle's fur by gently squeezing the fur in between your hands.Focus on the tail and paws. Most of the water will accumulate in these areas, so most of the excess you need to remove during this step will be in these areas.  Squeeze gently. Never pinch the dog's skin and avoid putting too much pressure on the dog's tails or legs. Also avoid pulling the hair as you wring it out.  Toss a soft towel over the dog. Rub and blot away as much moisture from the coat as possible using this towel.  The towel should be large enough to cover the dog and made from an absorbent material, like terry cloth.  Since poodles have a dense coat, you should work on blotting the water out rather than scrubbing it out. A lot of rubbing can cause the fur to become tangled, making it more difficult to comb out during the blow drying process.  While towel drying the dog, check in its ears. Lightly dab away any noticeable moisture inside the poodle's ears. If you allow excess moisture to remain in a dog's ears, it can easily cause a painful infection.  If you have managed to prevent your dog from shaking and splattering water all over the place before this moment, now is the time for you to drop your guard and let your dog shake itself.  Most dogs will want to shake their fur to remove excess water immediately after the bath, if not during it. Try to prevent your dog from doing so at those points to reduce the mess.  Since shaking is so natural, though, it is recommended that you let your poodle shake after you have towel dried as much excess moisture as possible. Doing so will make the dog feel better, and it will also help your dog dry faster overall.  Set your blow dryer on the lowest heat setting possible and hold it a forearm's length away from the coat. Dry your poodle off with the blow dryer, maintaining this setting and distance the entire time.  If possible, use a blow dryer specifically made for dogs and other pets. These machines are less likely to burn your dog than a human hair dryer is. A human blow dryer can still be used, if necessary, as long as it remains on a low to cool setting.  It is better for your poodle to blow dry the coat rather than letting it air dry. Air drying will increase the number of mats and tangles that form.  If you do choose to air dry your poodle, be aware of the fact that the hair will dry in curly ringlets. The only way to make the hair fluffy and straight is to dry the dog with a blow dryer.  As you blow dry the poodle's coat, you should simultaneously brush out any knots and mats with a slicker brush.If you do not brush and dry simultaneously, the coat will become more matted due to the force of the air blowing on it. These tangles will be more difficult to remove once the coat is dry than they will be to remove while the coat is in the process of drying.  Brushing the poodle's coat as you dry it will also help the coat become softer and fluffier.  If you aren't careful, you could accidentally burn or hurt the poodle while drying its coat. As long as you pay attention as you work, however, the dog should be perfectly fine by the end of the process.  Do not allow the blow dryer to come too close to the dog's skin, even if you have it set to a low heat. Your poodle's skin is too sensitive to heat, and even low dryer settings can cause the dog's skin to burn or otherwise become irritated.  Never aim the blow dryer at the poodle's face. It is best to towel dry the hair on your dog's face, or to otherwise let it air dry. The skin of the face is especially sensitive to heat and prone to burning.  If you use an automated dryer that hangs in front of a crated or leashed dog, you should test the temperature before aiming it at the poodle. You should also check the poodle every 5 to 10 minutes to make sure that the dog is still safe and not suffering from the heat.  After the poodle is completely dry, take a few minutes to brush out any knots you may have missed during the drying process. As before, use a slicker brush for best results.  Proper coat care will make both the bathing and drying process easier later on. The most important thing you need to do is simply to regularly brush the dog's coat.  Brush your poodle at least twice a week, if not more frequently.  Regular brushing will spread the natural oils produced by the skin throughout the coat, keeping it healthy. It also prevents tangles and mats, which can become painful for your dog if allowed to increase too severely.  In between baths, brush your poodle with a natural bristle brush, especially on areas with longer hair. Use a slicker brush afterward to pull out any mats and dead hair. A comb can be run through the dog's hair after that to catch any additional tangles.  ","rinse thoroughly. consider applying a conditioner. comb out any knots. squeeze out excess moisture. towel dry the dog. let your dog shake. blow dry the poodle using low heat. brush out the coat as you dry it. work carefully. brush out any remaining knots. take care of the poodle's coat in between baths.

"In Germany, for example, it is common to hold a dance on the night of April 30 that lasts past midnight. This is known as 'Tanz in den Mai'.  Choose wherever you most like going out to dance and treat this as an excuse for a special 'May 1st' dance celebration.  This is a traditional English dance often seen for May Day celebrations. If you're lucky, they might even give lessons for the day!  ,  Cotswold Morris uses either stick or handkerchiefs accompanying hand movements.  North West Morris has a military style shown by the precise movements.  Border morris is a more vigorous (and occasionally more dangerous) style of morris using sticks. Dancer often have blackened faces and rag coats for this style of dance.  Longsword dancing uses long rigid lengths of wood. It is often performed by older men at a slow pace though groups such as The Demon Barbers have challenged this stereotype.  Rapper sword dancing originated in the pubs surrounding the English mines after the working day ended. The swords (used to scrape soot from mine ponies backs) would be held by each handle joining five men in a circle. The idea was to jump or somersault over, move under and twist between the swords whilst being extremely drunk. The tradition continues in the form of DERT, the national competition which travels around the country.  Molly dancing was performed when work was scarce in an effort to receive payment for the spectacle.

"Line up a knife with the pod and press down to cut it open, then repeat with the remaining pods. If you don't wish to cut the pods in half, you can leave them intact or simply cut off the tips.  Whether you chose to infuse brandy, bourbon, tequila, or another type of alcohol with vanilla, just place the beans directly into the container and close the lid. Shake well.  Since strong-flavored spirits take longer to pick up the more subtle vanilla flavor, the bottles need to be shaken so that the vanilla gets distributed. For a week after putting the vanilla beans in the container, shake it several times a day. In the second week, shake it once a way.  Vanilla extract made with spirits aside from vodka takes longer to infuse. Store it in a cool, dry place for at least three months.  Open the bottle and sniff it, then take a taste. If the extract has a strong vanilla flavor, it's ready to use. If you can only taste the alcohol, replace the cap and let the extract infuse for another few weeks before using.  ","slit open the vanilla bean pods. place the vanilla beans into the alcohol container. shake the bottle. store the vanilla extract. determine whether the extract is ready. "
"Makeup should be stored in an interior closet, such as a linen closet, away from an outside wall. This is because exposure to warmth and sun can dry out the products. Too much warmth can also cause the natural oils to separate from the rest of the product, leading the makeup to expire., Although storing your makeup in the bathroom can be convenient, it is not necessarily the best idea. The bathroom has high levels of airborne bacteria that can contaminate your makeup and beauty products. The high exposure to bacteria can cause makeup products to expire sooner than they ordinarily would.Store makeup in your closet or a linen closet outside of the bathroom to keep it cool and dry.  You can store makeup in a dresser, set of drawers, or chest as an alternative.  An important aspect preserving makeup is keeping your makeup brushes clean. This will prevent bacteria from spreading and cross-contaminating your other products.  Wet the bristles of your brush.  Gently rub in brush cleaner or shampoo. Brush cleaners can be purchased at Sephora, Ulta, or drugstores in your area.  Rinse the brush.  Squeeze the excess water from the bristles of the brush.  Set the brush aside on a towel to air dry. It is important to let the brush dry on its side so that the water doesn’t get into the glue and loosen the bristles at the base of the handle.  Brushes used for concealer and foundation should be cleaned at least once a week.Clean brushes that are used for eye makeup at least twice a month.  All other brushes can be washed once a month.  When using liquid makeup, pour a small amount of makeup, as much as you intend to use, onto a makeup mixing palette. This will keep the bacteria out of the makeup bottle.Set the mixing palette on a flat surface.  Pour a small amount of the desired product onto the surface of the palette, taking care not to set it too close to the edge.  Dip your makeup brush into the product and apply it to your face (or wherever you are using the makeup).  ","store makeup in a cool, dry place. avoid storing makeup in the bathroom. clean makeup brushes regularly. pour out instead of dipping in. "

"The database is what will contain all of your data in its various forms. You can choose to create a blank database, a blank web database, or pick from a variety of templates.  A blank database is a standard Access database, and is good for local use. Creating a blank database will create one table as well.  Web databases are designed to be compatible with Access’s web publishing tools. Creating a blank database will create one table as well.  Templates are pre-built databases designed for a wide range of uses. Pick a template if you don’t want to spend a lot of time putting the database structure together.;  , Once you’ve selected a database type, give it a name that reflects what it’s for. This will be especially helpful if you’re going to be working with several different databases. Type the file name of your database in the 'File Name' box. Choose 'Create' to generate the new database file.  If you are creating a blank database, you’ll want to think about the best way to organize your data, and add the appropriate structure. There are several ways that you can format and interact with your data in Access:  Tables – This is the main way that data is stored in your database. Tables can be compared to spreadsheets in Excel: the data is organized in rows and columns. Because of this, importing data from Excel and other spreadsheet programs is a relatively straightforward process.  Forms – Forms are the way that data is added to your database. While you can enter the data into the database directly into the tables, using forms allows for quicker and more visual data entry.  Reports – These summarize and display the data in your database. Reports are for analyzing data and returning answers to specific questions, such as how much profit was made, or where customers are located. These are usually designed to be printed out.  Queries – This is how you retrieve and filter your data. You can use queries to display specific entries from multiple tables. You can also use queries to create and update data.  If you are starting a blank database, you will automatically begin with a blank table. You can begin entering your data into this table, either by hand or by copying and pasting from another source.  Each piece of data should be give its own column (field), while each record should be a separate row. For example, each row would be a customer while each field would be a different piece of information about that customer (first name, last name, email address, phone number, etc.).  You can rename the column labels to make it easy to tell what field is what. Double click the column heading to change the name.  If you want to import from a supported file or location, you can set Access to grab the information and add it to your database. This is useful for grabbing data off of a web server or some other shared resource.  Click the External Data tab.  Select the file type that you are importing. In the “Import and Link” section, you will see a few options for data types. You can click the More button to see more option. ODBC stands for Open Database Connectivity, and includes databases such as SQL.  Navigate to the location of the data. If it is on a server, you will need to provide the server address.  In the next window, choose 'Specify how and where you want to store the data in the current database.' Choose 'OK.' Follow the steps to import your data.  You will want to keep your different records in different databases. This will help keep your databases running smoothly. For example, you may have a table of customer information and another table for order information. You will then be able to link the customer information into the order information table.  In the Create section of the Home tab, click the table button. A new table will appear in your database. You can enter information in the same way you did for the first table.  Each table will have one primary key that is unique for each entry. By default, Access creates an ID column that increases in number for each entry. This is set as the primary key. Tables can also have foreign keys. These are fields that are linked with another table in the database. The linked fields would contain the same data.  For example, in your Orders table, you may have a Customer ID field to track which customer ordered which product. You can create a relationship for that field with the ID field in your Customer table.  Using relationships helps keep your data consistent, efficient, and readable.  Click the Relationships button in the Relationships section. This will open a new window with an overview of all of the tables in the database. Each field will be listed underneath its table’s name.  You will need to have created the field for the foreign key before you create the relationship. For example, if you want to use the Customer ID on the Orders table, create a field in the Orders table called Customer and leave it blank. Make sure it is the same format as the field you are linking (numbers in this case).  Drop it to the field that you created for the foreign key. Click Create in the window that appears to set the relationship for the fields. A line will appear between the two tables, connecting the fields.  Check the box to “Enforce Referential Integrity” when creating the relationship. This means that if data is changed in one field, the other field is automatically updated. This will help keep your data accurate.  Queries are actions that let you quickly view, add, and edit the data in your database. There are a wide variety of query types, ranging from simple lookups to the creation of new tables based on existing data. Queries are essential tools for building reports.Queries are broken down into two main types: Select and Action. Select queries pull data from tables and can make calculations. Action queries can add, edit, and delete data from tables.  If you want to create a basic select query, use the Query Wizard to walk you through the steps. You can access the Query Wizard from the Create tab. This will allow you to view specific fields from a table.  You can use criteria to narrow down your select query and only display the information you need. To start, click the Create tab and select Query Deign.  The Show Table box will open. Double-click the table that you want to run the query on, and then click Close.  Double-click on each field in the table that you want to add to the query. The fields will be added to the Design grid.  You can use several different types of criteria, such as text or functions. For example, if you wanted to only display prices higher than $50 from your “Prices” field, you would enter >=50 into the criteria. If you wanted to only show customers from the UK, you would type UK into the Criteria field.  You can use multiple criteria per query.  The Run button is located on the Design tab. Your Query results will be displayed in the window. Press Ctrl + S to save the query.  A parameter query will allow you to specify what you want to retrieve each time the query is run. For example, if you have a database with customers from various cities, you can run a parameter query to ask which city you want to display results for.  Add fields to be retrieved in the query by double-clicking them in the table overview.  Parameters are denoted by “.  You can end parameters with “?” or “:”, but not with “!” or “.”  , You can use multiple parameters to create a custom range for your query results. For example, if the field is a Date field, you can return a range of dates by typing Between And . You will receive two prompts when you run the query., You can use queries to pull specific data from existing tables and create a new table with this data. This is especially useful if you want to share specific parts of your database, or create specific forms for subsets of your database. You will need to create a regular select query first.  Double-click on the tables that you want to pull your data from. You can pull from multiple tables if necessary.  Double-click each field that you want to add from the table overview. It will be added to your query grid.  If you want to specify specific data from a field, use the criteria section to set the filter. See the “Creating a Select Query with Criteria” section above for more details.  Before you create your table, run the query to ensure that it is pulling all of the correct data. Adjust your criteria and fields until you get all of the data that you want.  Press Ctrl + S to save the query for later use. It will appear in your navigation frame on the left side of the screen. Click on the query to select it again and then click on the Design tab.  A window will appear asking for your new table name. Enter the name for the table and click OK.  Your new table will be created with the query you established. The table will appear in your navigation frame on the left.  You can use an append query to add data to a table that already exists from another table. This is useful if you need to add more data to a table you created with a make table query.  This will open the Append dialog box. Select the table you want to append.  For example, if you created a table with the criteria “2010” for the Year field, change it to the year you want to add, such as “2011”.  Make sure to set the correct fields for each column that you are appending. For example, when using the above changes, data should be appending to the Year field on the Append To row.  Click the Run button on the Deign tab. The query will be run and the data will be added to the table. You can open the table to verify that the data was added correctly.  Forms allow you to easily see the data for each field, as well as quickly switch between records or create new ones. Forms are essential for extended periods of data entry, as most people find them much easier to work with than tables.  This will create a form based on the fields contained in the table automatically. Access does a pretty good job of automatically creating fields that are the correct size, but you can resize and move around any elements on the form that you want.  If you don’t want a specific field to be displayed on the form, you can right-click on it and select Delete.  If your tables have relationships, a datasheet will appear beneath each record, showing the connected data. You can edit your connected data this way much easier. For example, each sales rep in your database may have a customer database attached to their record.  The arrow buttons at the bottom move from record to record. The fields will be populated by your record data as you switch between them. You can use the buttons on the edges to move to the first or last record.  This is located in the upper-left corner, and will allow you to start changing the values of your table by using the form.  You can edit the text in any field of each record to change the data in the table. The changes will reflect automatically in the table, as well as in any connected tables.  Click the “Add Record” button near the navigation buttons to create a new record at the end of the list. You can then use the fields to input data into the blank record in the table. This is a much easier way to add new information than through the table view.  Make sure to save your form by pressing Ctrl + S so that you can easily access it again later. It will appear in your navigation frame on the left side of the screen., Reports allow you to quickly display summaries of your data. They are often used for income and shipping reports, and can be tailored to just about any use. Reports draw data from either tables or queries that you have created.  Select the type of report you want to create. There are a few different ways you can go about creating a report. Access can create your report for you automatically, or you can create a custom one.  Report – This will create an auto-report with all of the data from your source. Nothing will be grouped, but for small databases this is probably sufficient for showing what you need.  Blank Report – This will create an empty report that you can fill with your data as you see fit. You will be able to choose from any available field to create a custom report.  Report Wizard – The report wizard will guide you through the report creation process, allowing to to choose and group your data, and then format it accordingly.

"Put on socks that will both push the leather outwards and protect your feet from any rubbing or pinching, preventing the formation of blisters.;  , Keep the shoes on long enough that they begin to mold to your feet, but not so long that they cause pain or injury. Walk around and stretch your feet while your wear them.  Do this whenever you have free time to change shoes and walk around, at least two to three times per day.  To find the time to switch between your comfy shoes and the Dr. Martens you’re breaking in, wear your new boots either before or after work, or during your lunch break at the office.  Slowly expand the amount of time you keep your shoes on your feet, paying close attention to how your feet feel. Don’t push through the pain!Because this is a slower and more time-consuming method, plan ahead. If you want to show off your new Dr. Martens at a particular event, begin this process about a month before that date.  Bend the back of the shoe inwards to make the heel area more spacious, then push the toe to and away from the laces. You can also bend the leather in and out on the instep (or the middle, by the laces) of the shoe. This may cause creasing in the leather. To avoid noticeable or permanent creases, be sure your leather is properly conditioned before you use your hands to stretch it. Dr. Martens has its own product, Wonder Balsam, for this purpose.  Periodically conditioning your boots will also aid in the overall break-in process. Soft and supple leather is much easier to stretch than stiff leather., Stuff your shoes with newspapers or a shoe tree to make sure they don’t shrink back down when you’re not wearing them. If you use newspaper, be sure to fully stuff the shoe.  Once you can comfortably wear your Dr. Martens for an hour, they should be fully broken in.

"You might have a parent you feel closer to or maybe one of your parents tends to be more lenient than the other. Oftentimes, breaking the news to a parent who is easier to talk to can clear the way for talking to the other parent.For instance, if you grew up as a 'daddy's girl,' meaning you can now wrap him around your little finger, you might start with your dad. On the other hand, if your dad tends to be overprotective, you might start with your mother instead.  This approach can be an especially helpful idea if you are a teenager with your first boyfriend.  On the other hand, if you think both of your parents will take it equally well (or badly), just rip off the bandaid and tell them both at the same time.;  , You don't want to tell your parents when they are busy with something else or when they aren't in a good mood. If you want, you can ask them when a good time to talk would be. Try to choose a time when the house is calm, and your parents are not stressed or distracted by something else.However, don't use picking a good time as a way to continually put off telling them. You will need to tell them eventually, so you might as well get it over with.  If you're afraid you'll get flustered, it's perfectly fine to write out what you think you'll say. Then practice saying it in front of a mirror. That way, when the time comes, you'll be able to get it out without stopping., You are hesitating about telling your parents for a reason. Do you think that your parents will be mad because you're dating? Maybe you think they won't approve of the person you're dating. On the other hand, maybe you just prefer to keep your personal life private. Knowing what you're feeling is important because you can use that in the discussion.For instance, if you think that your parents think that you aren't ready to date, you could say, 'Mom and Dad, I need to talk to you about something. I've been a little hesitant to tell you that I have a boyfriend because I think you think that I'm not old enough.'  , Once you sit down, you just need to get the conversation over with. Don't beat around the bush. However, you can soften the blow with qualifiers. For instance, you could say, 'I really love you two, and I don't want to make you mad. Also, I really want to be honest with you about my life. I want to tell you about the boy that I've started dating.'  , If you are trying to make a case for dating, lay out the reasons why you think you should be able to. For instance, maybe you think that you should be able to date because you are in high school, and most people your age are allowed to date. Be reasonable, and don't get angry if your parents don't agree.Your parents probably won't respond well to 'But everyone else is doing it!' However, you can pull statistics off the internet about the average age that people start dating, and you can bring up points about how you've shown your maturity in the last year.  If you're parents don't want you to date and you're asking them to let you, you need to be willing to compromise. Maybe you can suggest that you only see your boyfriend at school or that you only go on group dates with other people. Your parents just want to protect you, so you have to be willing to give up some of your freedom., Tell your parents about your boyfriend. Talk to them about his family and what you like about him. Highlight his good qualities so they get a sense of who he is. It's also helpful to have a photo for them to see.Your parents will probably have many, many questions. It is advisable to answer every question as honestly and fully as possible to reassure them about your new relationship. If you try to hide or lie about something, your parents may become suspicious and anxious.  If your boyfriend has a good relationship with his family, make sure your parents know. This trait is a major plus for many parents because it lets them know that this new guy in your life knows how to value others and can appreciate the tight ties of family.  One of the most important things to do if you want your parents to accept your boyfriend is to be the one to tell them about your relationship. If they find out about your relationship from someone else, they may assume that you were trying to hide it because you felt you were doing something wrong.You should tell your parents about your boyfriend even if you do not plan to make any formal introductions any time soon. As a general rule, the sooner you own up to the relationship, the better. Avoiding the conversation will only make it harder to have eventually and will increase the odds that your parents may find out from another source.  Once you get older and have already moved out of the house, you do not necessarily need to bring up every date or every boyfriend you have. Wait until a guy comes along that you can exclusively and seriously commit to before getting everyone worked up.

"It will also help if your parents are at the door or place where you are being dropped off for the night. Ask if they could come up to the door with you so that you can say goodnight.

"There are many herbicides you might use, though you should be aware this plant is resistant to many common treatments. Regular herbicides used for dandelion control won't likely be strong enough to kill creeping charlie.  Three way herbicides, often called 'trimec herbicides,' should be prioritized, as the special compounds in these are effective at eliminating creeping charlie.Some herbicides may affect other plants around the creeping charlie. You should consult the label of your herbicide to understand the full effects before administering it.  Some herbicides leave behind residue for a period of time after its application that can be harmful to children or animals. In these cases, you should block off the area and/or keep an eye around children and pets until the next rainfall or until your label indicates the herbicide has diminished to safe levels.  This is the ideal time for chemical treatment of creeping charlie. At this time of year, the plant begins storing nutrient in the stem and root system for the winter. This means your herbicide treatment will have a greater effect on the plant.When using a herbicidal treatment, more is not always better. Follow the directions that came with your herbicide for best results.  A follow-up spring application is best suited to severe or especially stubborn cases., If you have a plot that is susceptible to creeping charlie, or if this plant is common in your area, even if you kill or remove it completely it'll likely spring up again from another source. In this situation, you'll likely have to apply herbicide yearly to your lawn to ensure the plant doesn't come back.  You can also make your lawn less hospitable for creeping charlie by creating a bright sunlight environment by pruning shade casting branches.  A thick cover of grass can also make your lawn less hospitable for creeping charlie. By planting grass that grows well in shade, it's less likely creeping charlie will pop up in shady areas that are more susceptible to the plant.

"Write on the grey lines in the endorsement area on the back of the check. On the first line, write the name of your business.  For example, write 'Jim's Hardware Store' on the first line of the check.  Use this method when a check is made out to your business rather than just to you.  If you want to add any restrictions, then you can do this before signing the check. Just like personal checks, you can add a restrictive endorsement to your business check, indicating you only want it deposited at the business' bank in a specific account, or you can transfer the rights to the check from the business to another individual or business.  For example, writing 'For Deposit Only' with your bank and account number ensures the check can only be deposited in one of your business' accounts.  If you want to transfer the check, you can write 'Pay to the Order of' and the name of another person or business. Once you have written the transfer endorsement, the transferee must endorse the check in order to cash or deposit it.  If you have not added a restriction, such as 'For Deposit Only,' this creates an unrestricted endorsement on your business check, meaning that anyone who has access to the check can cash or deposit the check.  For example, you can write 'James Smith, Owner' beneath your business name.  For your endorsement of a business check to be valid, you must be authorized by the business to do so.

"There are several benefits to having your cat come to you when you call her. For example, you can call her when it’s playtime or mealtime.You can also call your cat if you are unable to locate her in your home.In addition, when your cat knows how to come to you when you call her, you will have the reassurance that she is safely accounted for if you have to leave the house.If your cat is indoor/outdoor, it will be helpful to call her to come back inside.Calling your cat is also beneficial when it is time to leave the house for her veterinary appointment.Your cat may not view a trip to the veterinarian as a pleasant experience, so you may need to allow some extra time to get her come to you when it’s time to leave for her appointment.  Because cats are naturally intelligent, teaching your cat to come to you when she is called is a great mental exercise for her.;  , Although positive reinforcement (verbal praise, petting) is an important component of successful training, the key to training your cat to respond to your call is an enticing reward.The most enticing reward for her will probably be food that she thinks is delicious, such as tuna, shredded chicken, or sardines.You can also purchase cat treats at your local pet store.Keep multiple treats on hand. When you reward her, you can vary which food you reward her with so that she does not come to expect the same reward each time.Catnip is not a good reward. Your cat’s desire for catnip would likely diminish if she receives it more than once a week, so it would be best to select a food treat that will consistently entice her.Whichever food reward you choose, use it only when you call her. It is preferable for your cat to associate that tasty reward with responding to your call and no other commands or verbal cues.Playtime can also be an enticing reward., You can use any verbal cue that you would like.One common verbal cue that cat owners will use is “Here, kitty kitty.” You can also use the words “come” or “treats.”The verbal cue should not be something that you already use, such as her name.You can also use various tones of voice. Cats typically respond to a high-pitched tone of voice, since their prey usually makes high-pitched sounds in the wild.If you are not the only person in the house who would be calling your cat, make sure that everyone uses the same verbal cue and tone to call her.If your cat is deaf or hard of hearing, you will need to use some different methods to get her attention, such as visual cues– flicking a light on and off or using a laser pointer (available at your local pet store). Deaf or hearing-impaired cats also respond to vibrations in the floor, so you can thump or stomp of the floor to call your cat., A convenient time to practice calling your cat is around feeding time. Your cat will likely already be hungry, which may make the training process easier and faster.In addition, she will already be used to going to the kitchen (or wherever you keep her food bowl), so you will not be calling her to a room that is unfamiliar to her when you begin training her.  Another benefit to calling her at her regular feeding time is that she will already know what time to get her food.This will make the initial training easier because you will not be doing something that is completely unfamiliar to her.  If you choose to reward with her extra play, then you can practice calling her when it’s getting close to her scheduled playtime.If the kitchen and her play areas have a lot of distractions, consider calling your cat in a quiet room that doesn’t have any distractions that could keep her from coming to you., When you are in the room where you want her to come to you, say your verbal cue in a high-pitched voice. If you are calling her when it’s time for her to eat, make sure that you say the verbal cue before you open a can of food or rip open a bag of food. You want to ensure that your cat comes because she heard your verbal cue, not because of the noises of food preparation.Reward her immediately when she comes to you, whether that is with the tasty treat or extra playtime.Extra positive reinforcement through petting and verbal praise will also be helpful.  Even if you are calling her at mealtime, it is still important to give her the tasty treat as a reward, rather than just feeding her the regular food.  If you are calling her around playtime, say the verbal cue without shaking a toy that makes noise.  It may take her a week or so before she starts to consistently come to you when you call her., Once your cat consistently comes to her play or feeding areas when you call her, take the difficulty up a notch.

"If you worked with an attorney to draft your estate planning documents, contact them and let them know that you want to update your documents to indicate your desire to be an organ donor.It typically isn't necessary to include organ donation in a will or trust, because your loved ones likely won't find these documents until it's already to late to donate your organs.  When you contact your attorney, they will let you know what documents need to be updated and how you should go about it.  Your living will tells your loved ones what you want to happen if you are in the hospital on life support. Your healthcare power of attorney gives a specific person the power to make healthcare decisions for you if you are unconscious or unable to make those decisions on your own.If you have either, or both, of these documents, they should include organ donation.  If you don't have a living will and healthcare power of attorney, talk to an attorney about creating one. When you document your intentions in a living will or healthcare power of attorney, Wisconsin law requires any healthcare providers or family members involved in making your end-of-life decisions to honor those intentions.  You also should let the person you've named in these documents know that you are now registered as an organ donor. Give them a copy of the new documents for their records.  Even after you've registered as an organ donor, your wishes may not be honored unless those around you know that you intend to donate your organs.It's a good idea to let your primary care physician and any other health care providers who treat you regularly that you've registered as an organ donor.  You also want to let close family know, particularly your spouse or parents. If you don't have a healthcare power of attorney, these are the people who will be making your end-of-life decisions.

"Using someone's assets to pay off debts may not directly protect estate assets from the government. However, since debts would be paid out of the estate, fewer debts mean more estate assets.For example, assets can be used to pay off credit cards or personal loans. Since available credit is not considered an asset, these payments do not affect the person's eligibility for medical assistance.  Paying off existing debts and obligations also doesn't qualify as a transfer that could result in a penalty if done within five years before the person applies for medical assistance.  In addition to paying debts, it's also possible to use assets to purchase exempt items. For example, the person could buy a new HVAC unit or new roof for their primary residence.  Certain assets, such as a personal residence, a car, and other personal items such as furniture and clothing, are exempt from seizure by the government to recoup medical assistance.The homestead exemption covers the primary residence of the person on medical assistance if their spouse still lives in the home, or if the person is reasonably expected to return home after long-term stay in a nursing home.  For example, the homestead exemption would apply to the primary residence of an unmarried individual who was staying in a nursing home for several months to recover after hip surgery, but was expected to return home.  Keep in mind that people are expected to use the equity in their home to cover their long-term care expenses. The government will put a lien on the property if it is owned by the person on medical assistance.  For this reason, transferring the home to a trust may protect it for future generations.  Another way to protect the home is to transfer the deed to the person who would get it under a will or other estate plan, and then grant the person on medical assistance a life estate in the property.  However, the government can reach life estate properties as well in some circumstances. Contact an attorney if you're thinking about using this option to protect the estate assets of someone on medical assistance.  If the person on medical assistance has regular bills that are due each month, you may be able to make advance payments on those bills using the person's liquid assets.Keep in mind that this doesn't preserve assets for the estate in a direct sense. However, advance payments for regular bills decrease that person's expenses while they remain in a nursing home.  Fewer expenses means more assets for the person's estate. It also means the person's spouse, children, or grandchildren aren't forced to pay these expenses on their behalf while they're in a nursing home.  Property taxes are a good regular expense on which you can make advance payments.  One benefit of making advance payments is that this sort of transfer can be made at any time. Even if made during the look-back period (in other words, less than five years before the person starts medical assistance), these payments are considered totally valid and won't affect the person's eligibility for medical assistance.  A person on medical assistance can pay a family member for services. However, those services must be provided under a written contract. The family member's payment cannot exceed the usual payment for similar services. These payments can be used to transfer assets to a family member that would have been passed on using a will, trust, or other estate planning document.  For example, suppose Sally wants to leave her son $10,000. She has to spend down her assets before entering the nursing home so she will qualify for medical assistance.  Sally drafts a contract with her son under which she pays him $1,000 a month to serve as caretaker and landscaper at her home while she is in the nursing home.  Provided the payment Sally has agreed to make are similar to what other full-time caretakers and landscapers would earn, this payment would not be considered an unlawful transfer that would affect Sally's eligibility for medical assistance.

"Make it as short as possible and not too complicated. If you have a script you won't have to worry about remembering what to say and you should be able to focus on the performance. You should try to follow the script but also leave room for spontaneous moments. Work in feeling and a sense of importance or excitement into your article to catch the watcher right from the start and keep them interested throughout.;  , The better your script and filming, the less time you spend on editing. Focus on delivering the speech straight to the camera and never second guessing yourself. If you want, practice without the camera on a couple of times to be sure that you efficiently deliver the speech.  Try to avoid leaning over, fixing your hair, stuttering or fixing your clothes. Distracting movements will only inhibit you from doing your best. If you need any props, keep them on a small table to the side of you so that it is not visible to the camera. Try not to say things like 'um' or 'and' over and over. If you want you can put a full length mirror behind the camera so that you can see yourself and watch the way you move, but be sure not to use this as an excuse to fix your clothes or hair and be careful to look at the camera instead of the mirror the majority of the time.  If you're doing this outside, at home or anywhere else where there might be people or noises try your best to cut down on extra noise during the filming. Let people know that you're going to be filming and you need it to be as quiet as possible. If you have animals try to keep them out of the frame and preferably in a different room.  This is the most important step. Make sure that you are not distracted or tempted to look away from the camera at all. Videos in which people don't maintain eye contact are never as effective or nice to watch as videos where the person does. You'll probably feel a little silly talking to a camera, so take a deep breath and treat it just like you're having a normal conversation with someone. If it helps to envision someone you like to talk to as the camera than do that, whatever works you should do.  You are your worst enemy, so try not to worry too much about everything you do. Have fun and let go. If you make a mistake don't let it show and no one will ever notice, so go on as if nothing happened and have fun with it.  If you need help don't be afraid to ask! You can also find good instructions for video editing if you do a google search or a wikiHow search. It doesn't have to be perfect and if this is your first time creating a video don't worry too much about the editing.  Send it in an e-mail to your friends and family or keep a copy on a CD or thumb drive to show to people if you want to.  ","start with a script. do your best when recording your invitation. practice good video etiquette. keep it quiet except for you in the video. maintain eye contact with the camera. don't overanalyze your actions. editing could be a complicated process so try to use simple tools (unless you are a pro), and you'll probably have a lot of fun. embed the video on video sharing websites such as youtube or attach it as an attachment (if you've exported it into a .wmv format).

"Mistakes in an employee’s name and social security number are the most common mistakes that employers make when submitting an employee’s W-2 to the government. This mistake must be corrected or the IRS may reject your federal tax return.  A common mistake on the W-2 is that the employer incorrectly listed your first name as your last name.;  , When reviewing your W-2, compare the amount of your wages and taxes withheld to your last paycheck in the tax year for which you are filing. If there is a dramatic difference, you should discuss the issue with your employer.  A common mistake on W-2s is for a decimal point to be placed incorrectly. For example, if you actually made $36,502.32 but your W-2 reported your income as $365,023.20. This mistake could cause significant issues when you attempt to file your tax returns.If there is only a slight variation between your final paycheck for the tax year and the W-2, this may be because your pay period included part of the following tax year. This would not require a corrected W-2 (W-2c).  If you contributed to an employee retirement plan, this will be noted on Box 12 of the W-2 with a code that is meant to designate the type of plan. Employers routinely list the wrong code on the W-2.  You can check the IRS retirement codes at: https://www.irs.gov/Retirement-Plans/Common-Errors-on-Form-W2-Codes-for-Retirement-Plans  If you are unsure of the type of plan for which you or your employer contributed on your behalf, you should ask your employer., While some mistakes may be easily noticed, other mistakes on your W-2 may be less obvious unless you compare your paystub to your W-2. By finding mistakes right away, you have time to get a corrected W-2 (W-2c) and still file your taxes before the deadline. The most common mistakes on W-2s in 2014 included:  Missing or incorrect names or social security numbers.  An incorrect Employer Identification Number (EIN) or employer address.  Failure to report correct federal income tax or Medicare Tax.  Incorrectly listing the proper retirement plan.  Failure to include certain compensation in Social Security and Medicare wages.  Listing excess contributions to Health Savings Accounts or Flexible Savings Accounts. Employees are limited in how much they can contribute annually to these types of accounts and the amount changes every year.Failure to reduce your income for pretax contributions made to taxable life insurance., If you did not receive your W-2 by the beginning of February or the information on your W-2 was incorrect, you should immediately contact your employer and notify him or her of the mistake or missing W-2.  Employers who have been notified of an error on an employee’s W-2 have a legal responsibility to file a W-2c and correct the mistake.It may be best to send an email to the business manager or whoever is responsible for sending W-2s.  Your email should state that you noticed a mistake on your W-2 and you should provide information about the nature of the mistake. For example, you can state “My social security number was incorrect on my W-2. I am requesting that you file a corrected W-2. Please let me know when I should come and speak with you about the issue.”  You should not include your social security number in an email since it makes you vulnerable to identity theft.  If you notified your employer of the mistake and you have not received a corrected W-2 by the end of February, you should contact the IRS to assist you. You can contact the IRS by calling 800-829-1040. You must have the following information available to you when you call:  Your name, complete address, phone number and social security number.  Your employer/payer’s name, complete address and phone number.  Your employer’s EIN, if you know it.  An estimate of the wages that you earned during the tax year, the dates of your employment, and the federal income tax withheld. You can locate some of this information on your pay stub.The IRS will send a letter to your employer to file a corrected W-2 form within 10 days and also notifies the employer of the legal penalties to which your employer may be subject if he or she fails to submit the form.You will also receive a Form 4852, Substitute for Form W-2, Wage and Tax Statement, from the IRS that can be used to file your income taxes should your employer fail to submit a corrected W-2., If you have not received a W-2c by the time you are required to submit your federal income taxes, you can use Form 4852. You can also use this form if you never received your W-2.  You should note that a tax refund may be delayed when you submit your taxes with Form 4852.If after you submit your taxes you receive your W-2c and it differs from Form 4852 and the amounts your reported on your income tax return, then you will have to file Form 1040X, Amended Tax Return.You can locate form 1040X at: https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040x.pdf.  While an employer is not required to reimburse you for tax preparation costs that you incurred as a result of the incorrect W-2, some employers will reimburse employees in order to maintain good employee relations.  You can discuss reimbursement with your employer directly or submit the request in writing.  Make sure that you submit any receipts for the costs of tax preparation related solely to the incorrect W-2.  Typically, an employer will only reimburse you if you received your W-2c after you filed your tax return and you needed to take extra steps and incurred costs related to filing amended state and federal tax returns., As an employer, your are legally obligated to correct mistakes on an employee’s filed W-2. You can make these corrections by filing Form W-2c.  You can correct misstates related to an employee’s name and social security number by completing Form W-2c boxes d through i.  If an employee’s social security number was reported as blanks or zeros, you should not file a W-2c but rather contact the SSA at 1-800-772-6270 for instructions.If the W-2c has an incorrect employee address, you can issue a W-2c to the employee with the new address but you do not need to file it with the SSA.You can order a W-2c at: https://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Online-Ordering-for-Information-Returns-and-Employer-Returns.  You cannot submit W-2c forms downloaded from the internet.  If you submit a W-2c to the SSA, you must also file Form W-3c, Transmittal of Corrected Wage and Tax Statements. This form acts almost like a coversheet for a corrected W-2 form. The form must be completed in dark ink or Courier 12 font. You must complete every box on the form, even if you only enter a 0 (zero).  The employer must sign the form.You can order Form W-3c at: https://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Online-Ordering-for-Information-Returns-and-Employer-Returns.  Forms W-2c and W-3c must be submitted together and can be filed in the following ways:  The forms can be filed electronically at: https://www.socialsecurity.gov/bso/bsowelcome.htm after you register for an account at the same website.  You can mail the forms via the U.S. Postal Service to: Social Security Administration Data Operations Center, P.O.

Mountain Drive Wilkes-Barre, PA 18702-7997., If an employee reports that he or she did not receive his or her W-2 but all of the information was correct, an employer can issue a replacement Form W-2.  If you are reissuing a paper copy of the employee’s W-2 it must be labeled “REISSUED STATEMENT.” You do not need to put this label on W-2s that are reissued electronically,  You should not file Copy A of the reissued W-2 with the SSA since the information did not need to be corrected.

"Research what kind of trees grow in local forests. Then, decide which kind you'd like to use for your canoe. Look for a sturdy stout tree that is straight and symmetrical.  Dugout canoes are often made from cedar, willow, spruce, pine, cottonwood, and redwood. Traditionally, they were made with whatever was growing close to a river source., Walk through a nearby forest and find a tree. Look for one that's large and tall enough to make into a canoe. Remember, you'll only be using the long trunk of the tree; you won't want to use branches.  You can cut down a tree, especially one that's already dead, or you can use a tree that's already fallen.  If the tree is still standing, have someone help to first cut the tree down. Then, make two clean cuts at the ends of your log. Make sure no branches are growing out from any part of your log. Your log should be as long as you'd like your canoe to be.  Make sure you have permission to cut down a tree even if it's dead.  If you're unsure how long you'd like to make your canoe, cut a longer log. That way you can cut down and make a shorter canoe, if you choose.  Given the enormous size of your log, you may want to work in the field or forest where you cut your log. This will save you from having to move it.

"The easiest way to keep elderly people safe around active dogs is to keep them separated. This may mean putting the dog in its crate, out in the yard, or in a separate room that is closed off while an elderly person is visiting.Placing an active dog in an isolated location may require that you train it not to bark or cry as well. In some cases an active dog that is isolated from the group my be very upset about that isolation.  If you cannot put the dog in a totally separate room, you can at least force it to keep physical distance from the elderly person. Place baby gates or obstacles in the way that keep the dog in a separate space from the elderly person.This solution works best for dogs that cannot jump and that will not use their brute strength to knock down an obstacle.  Also, using a baby gate does not keep your dog from barking or whining incessantly. In order to stop this, you will need to train it not to.  If the dog needs to be in the same room as the elderly person, then you will need to keep a firm hold on it. This is most easily done by keeping a leash on it and holding that leash tightly.If you have a harness on the dog this can also be used to hold onto the dog and make sure it does not knock over or otherwise injure the elderly person you are around.  ","keep them separated. place barriers to restrict your dog's movement. keep the dog on leash. "
"This includes items you may carry in your pockets such as pens, keys, or small pistols.;  , Clenched fists give away your readiness to strike. Open hands present a non-threatening appearance that will cause an attacker to let his guard down, while still leaving you the options to suddenly strike or grab.  Screaming may draw attention and scare the attacker away.  What use is any other defense tactic if you get knocked out?  , To form the hand for a palm-heel strike, bend the wrist back at a 90 degree angle and spread and claw the fingers. For an edge of hand blow, straighten the fingers and press them together, and strike with the muscle in the side of the hand. When striking down into an assailant's face, clench the fist and strike with the little finger side. Closed fist punches rely on wrist strength and stability to deliver a proper strike, and the knuckles are easily broken in the confusion of a fight.  These areas are easy to hit and will probably knock the enemy down for your chance to escape. Remember that a heavy strike to a person's face is highly effective at making them lose their senses. A broken nose or strike to the eyes will greatly hinder your opponent's ability to observe and react. Do not strike a person in the mouth--this will damage your hand.  So can headbutting.  The eyes and throat are especially vulnerable areas.  Instead, use your knee repeatedly.  Not only could this cause their nose to bleed, but it will cause their eyes to water, giving you a chance of escape.  If an attacker gets a hold of you and doesn't have a firearm pointed to your head or a knife to your neck, squirm. Squirming and pinching the attacker can help you get out of his or her clutches. If the attacker has a weapon, keep it away from you.  Kicking the jaw off of an unconscious person isn't self defense, it's a lack of self control.  ","remember that every part of your body and everything on your person has the potential to be used as a weapon. open your hands and keep them in front of you in a pleading position when confronted by a potential attacker. scream. block or dodge an oncoming attack. strike with the heel of your hand, or with the meaty little-finger side of your fist. aim for sensitive areas such as face, stomach, groin, knee, shin and instep. if you are in close proximity to your attacker, jabbing with your elbows and fingers can be an effective method of defense. if necessary, use any hard item available to poke, jab or scratch your assailant's face: a stick, a brick, a pen, a piece of glass, etc. never kick your attacker in the groin, this gives them a chance to grab hold of your leg. using the heel of your palm, hit the attacker's nose upwards. squirm. once you have taken your attacker down and they are no longer a threat, stop attacking. call police once your attacker is no longer a threat.

"When substances build up around the teeth of your zipper, it can prevent the zipper from staying closed.

"Wrap the yarn over the crochet hook three times, working from back to front around the hook.Wrap the yarn in between the loop already on your hook and the opening of the hook. Note that each consecutive yarn-over should be made in between the last one and the opening, not in between the previous yarn-over and the starting loop on your hook.;  , Slide the tip of the hook into the stitch indicated in your pattern instructions.  Only insert the tip of the hook. Do not draw any of the yarn already on your hook through the stitch.  Keep the working yarn behind your crochet piece as you continue along.  With the opening of the crochet hook still behind the piece, wrap the yarn over the hook once, letting this yarn-over slide into the opening of the hook.  Wrap the yarn from back to front.  Pull the crochet hook back through to the front of the stitch, bringing the most recent yarn-over with it. Note that the yarn-over has now turned into a loop.  There should be five loops on your hook at this point.  You may need to keep tension on the previously worked portion of the piece using the thumb and index finger of your non-dominant hand (the hand not holding onto the hook). Doing so can make it easier to slide the hook in and out of the stitch.  Wrap the yarn over the tip of the hook once more time.  Work from back to front again.  Let the yarn-over slip into the opening of the hook.  With the previous yarn-over caught in the hook opening, draw it through the top two loops previously on your hook.  If you have difficulty drawing the yarn-over through the loops, gently twist the hook so that the opening faces down and try again.  You should be left with four loops on your hook at this point.  Yarn over the hook, then draw the yarn-over through two loops. Repeat this three more times until you are left with only one loop on your hook.After the first repetition, you will have three loops left on the hook.  After the second repetition, you will have two loops remaining on the hook.  After the third repetition, you will only be left with one loop on the hook.  Once you complete this step, you have completed one DTR (double treble crochet) stitch.  Attach the yarn to your crochet hook using a slipknot and create a foundation chain. Your foundation chain needs to have five stitches more than the number of double treble crochets you want in your first row.  For example, if you want to create a row of 10 double treble crochets, you need to start with a foundation chain made of 15 chain stitches.  If you do not know how to make a chain stitch or a slipknot, please check the 'Tips' section for additional help.  Skip over the first five stitches next to your hook and work one standard double treble crochet into the sixth stitch. Use the same method described in the 'Double Treble Crochet Stitch' section of the article.  Yarn over three times.  Insert the hook into the stitch to be worked. In this case, it is the sixth stitch.  Yarn over once.  Draw the yarn-over back through to the front of the stitch to create a loop.  Yarn over once.  Draw the yarn-over through two loops.  Repeat three more times: yarn over, draw it through two loops; yarn over, draw it through two loops; yarn over, draw it through two loops.  This completes the stitch.  Work one double treble crochet into each chain of your foundation chain. Continue doing this until you reach the end of the chain.  To complete a straight row, only make one double treble crochet per stitch.  Once you reach the end of the chain, you have completed a first full row of double treble crochet.  If you have not done so already, flip the crochet work over so that its front becomes the back and its back becomes the front.  Note that this technique applies if you are working on your second row or any row after that. It will vary slightly from a row of double treble crochet completed from a foundation chain.  The purpose of a turning chain is to extend the yarn up to the finished height of your next row, and the height of that turning chain is based on the type of stitch you will be making in that row. For a row of double treble crochet, you need a chain of five stitches.  When counting the stitches in this row, you will count your turning chain as one double treble crochet.  Work one standard double treble crochet stitch into the second stitch of the previous row, counting the stitches starting at your hook. When the time comes, insert the hook into both top loops of the stitch, working from front to back. The double treble crochet you make now should follow the basic instructions provided in this article.  Yarn over three times.  Insert the yarn into the stitch to be worked. In this case, that should be the second stitch. Make sure that you insert the hook into both top loops from front to back.  Yarn over once.  Draw the yarn-over into a loop at the front of the piece.  Yarn over once.  Draw the yarn-over through two loops on your hook.  Repeat three more times: yarn over, draw it through two loops; yarn over, draw it through two loops; yarn over, draw it through two loops.  When you only have one loop on your hook, the stitch is complete.  Make one and only one double treble crochet in each stitch of the previous row. Continue until you reach the end of the row to complete a full row of double treble crochet.  Note that for future rows, you will need to make your last double treble crochet into the fifth stitch of the turning chain from the previous row.  You can complete as many rows of double treble crochet as desired using this technique.

"Acrylic is a soft, malleable finish, which means it can easily be scratched or marked up if you’re not careful. To prevent doing lasting damage to your shower, pick out a product that doesn’t contain any harsh chemicals or astringents. Your best bet is to use a mild acid-based solution like Lysol Power Bathroom Cleaner, Formula 409 All-Purpose cleaner or Bar Keeper’s Friend.Stay away from any type of astringent cleanser, including Comet, Ajax and Scrubbing Bubbles, as well as solvents like acetone.  Whenever possible, using natural derivatives to clean your bathroom will be your safest choice.;  , Apply the cleaner liberally to areas where grime, soap scum and hard water stains have accumulated. Focus on spots that suffer from visible dirt or discoloration. You may need to use quite a bit of cleaner in order to penetrate multiple layers of dried-on residue.  Be sure to remove all soaps, shampoos and other hygiene products from the shower before you get started so that you can clean underneath them.  Pull back the shower curtain all the way and turn on the overhead fan to keep the bathroom properly ventilated while you clean.  After a few minutes, the dingy messes that have built up on the surface of your acrylic shower will begin to dissolve. This will allow you to wipe them away with ease.If you’re dealing with particularly heavy soap scum or stains, it may help to reapply the cleaner once or twice.  Use this time to take care of any other cleaning tasks you need to complete, like detailing the faucet or shower head.  Turn on the shower head and direct the flow of water over the areas of the acrylic you just sprayed. Wash away as much liquefied grime and cleaning solution as you can. Once you’ve given the shower a preliminary rinse, go over the acrylic with using a soft microfiber towel or sponge to remove any remaining residue.Never use abrasive scrubbers, such as wire brushes or rough kitchen sponges, to clean an acrylic surface. These will leave behind tiny scratches in the finish that will then trap dirt in the future, making it much harder to remove.  ","choose a non-abrasive cleaning solution. spray the product onto shower stains. let the cleaner sit for 5-10 minutes. rinse and wipe out the shower. "
"A modern assault rifle can shoot up to 300 meters and has selective firing mechanisms.Common assault rifles include the AK-47, M4A1 carbine, and M16.Also think about extra features that you might want with the assault rifle:sights  electronics  collapsible stocks  suppressors  lasers  drum magazines;  , If you don’t know what rifle you want, then try speaking to someone who is familiar with the different assault rifles on the market. You can stop by the nearest firing range to ask someone who works there if they have any advice for you.  State law supplements federal law. Although federal law mandates background checks, it currently requires that checks only be performed if you purchase from a licensed dealer. Federal law does not mandate that background checks be performed when a sale is made between private parties.An individual state, however, can require that even private sellers perform background checks. You can find relevant state laws by visiting your local law library, which should be housed in your local courthouse.  Alternately, you can search the web. Type “assault rifle” or “assault weapon” and then your state into your favorite web browser. Look for state-specific laws on background checks, registration, and other requirements.  The federal background check can typically be completed in a couple of minutes. Nevertheless, the FBI has up to three days to perform the check. If three days pass without hearing from the FBI, then the seller can proceed with the rifle sale.Federal law limits who may buy a gun that has shipped in interstate or international commerce. The following are some of the groups of people federal law prohibits from purchasing a firearm:anyone convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment of more than a year  a fugitive from justice  an illegal alien  someone under a restraining order for harassing or threatening an intimate partner or the child of an intimate partner  a person convicted of domestic violence  , If you know the exact type of rifle that you want, then you should comparison shop. There is no reason to purchase the first rifle that you find. Instead, you can compare prices from different retailers and take the best offer that you can find.  You can join gun groups on the web, including Facebook. By joining, you can stay up to date on the prices and availability of different assault rifles.Start early. If you need the rifle by a certain date, then you should give yourself a couple of months to search. You might need to visit multiple gun shows or contact several private dealers.  Some assault rifles are for sale online. You can search for websites. One website is www.gunbroker.com. You can bid on assault rifles that meet your criteria.  You also might be able to make a private purchase through a gun group. Many members put guns up for sale. You can reach out and close a private sale without having to go through a background check.By contrast, some online sellers will require that you make the purchase through a Federal Firearms License (FFL) dealer. With an FFL dealer, you will have to undergo a background check. Some sellers prefer to use an FFL so that they can have a record of the sale and confirm that they are not selling to a felon., If you buy at a gun show from a private dealer, you can avoid a background check. Gun shows are held at various times of the year. To find a gun show near you, you can search the web. There are several websites which update a list of gun shows on a weekly basis.If you plan on traveling a distance, then call ahead of time to make sure that the gun show is still being held.  Some gun shows charge a small admission fee, usually around $5. Children are sometimes admitted for free., You will need to fill out a background check form if you purchase from a gun shop. Any gun shop that sells you an assault rifle legally will be an FFL., You may need to register your new rifle with the appropriate law enforcement agency. Instead of a comprehensive federal scheme, each state determines its own registration requirements.You should check with local law enforcement to find out what your state’s registration requirements are.  Several states prohibit all registries. Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, and Vermont all prohibit registries as of 2015.If you live in one of those states, then you will not have to register your new rifle.  If you do not want to ask law enforcement, for fear that they will now be suspicious that you have a gun, you can consult an attorney. An attorney will research the law and provide you with confidential advice about your registration obligations under the law.  You should have all of your guns under lock and key. Also be sure to put a trigger lock or other safety device on the gun. You should then store any rifles in a locked container.You should think about safe storage even if you do not have children. Visitors, intruders, and other people could stumble upon a gun in your home and assume that it is not loaded. Also, if you ever get drunk or high, or if you hallucinate, then you could access an unlocked gun when you aren’t thinking clearly. By keeping the gun locked in a storage container, you ensure that you only handle the gun when you are thinking clearly.  You can get a safety device approved by the Department of Justice. You can find approved safety devices at https://oag.ca.gov/firearms/fsdcertlist.  By storing the ammunition in a different location, you make it harder for any children to accidentally shoot the gun or for an intruder to gain access to a loaded gun.You should store ammunition in a locked container as well. This increases the safety.  If you have children, then you will want to educate them about guns. No matter how careful you are, you might accidentally leave a gun out at some point. Your children should know what to do:Avoid touching the gun. Make sure your children understand not to pick up the gun or play with it. Instead, they should leave the area where the gun is immediately.  Tell an adult. Once they leave the gun area, they should go directly to an adult and tell him or her that the gun is out.

"The best time of year in terms of weather and Miami attractions and events is also the most expensive.  If you're looking for the best value for your money, you can avoid the crowds, but Miami weather can be uncomfortable and volatile.;  ,  Temperatures are in the 70s (20s Celsius), and the sun is always shining.  A popular Miami attraction is its nightlife, which kicks into full gear during the peak season.  Dinner reservations can be hard to get.  Due to the crowds at Miami attractions, the advice is usually to arrive early.  Hotels fill up quickly, so book early.  Many hotels offer great deals in the off-season; however, some use off-season to make renovations.  Daily rains aren't unheard of, but sometimes they're over quickly.  Labor Day weekend finds Miami bursting at the seams, however, as visitors try to get one more vacation weekend under their belts.  Visit Miami in October through December to benefit from great Miami weather while avoiding the worst of the crowds.  Avoid Miami trips around holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas, when the crowds visit Miami.  June through November is hurricane season with hurricanes typically peaking in August.  August tends to be the most humid month, with humidity pushing the heat index over 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.8 degrees Celsius).  Miami weather in August doesn't mean the most rain, however. That distinction belongs to June. However, August usually has the second most rainfall.  If Miami travel must be during summer, remember that you can cool off in the Atlantic Ocean at Miami's great beaches.  Look at specific Miami areas, like the Art Dec district, Little Havana, South Beach or Calle Ocho.  Two tracks offer thoroughbred racing: Calder Racecourse and Gulfstream Park.  The city's home football team is the Miami Dolphins.  The Miami Heat is the professional basketball team.  The Florida Marlins won major league baseball's 2003 World Series.  If you want to catch professional ice hockey, Miami has the Florida Panthers.  ","consider what you want most from a miami trip, because most trips involve a trade-off. visit miami at peak time, which is january through april. weekdays are slightly less busy than weekends. take a miami trip in june through september, the low season, for great deals and fewer crowds. combine the best of the high and low seasons when you time your miami travel for the last three months of the year. avoid nasty and uncomfortable miami weather in august. find more events happening during the peak season, but most miami attractions are open year-round. attend miami sporting events in season.

"If you don't know anything about navigation units, determine how much you are willing to spend, and move on to step 2.;  , Look in 'GPS' or 'GPS/Navigation' departments. You may also want to search for 'Satellite Navigation' or 'sat nav'. You can also find online GPS comparison sites which provide a list of ratings and features for many models.  Choose between one for your car (Garmin Nuvi, Magellan Maestro, Magellan Roadmate, TomTom one, TomTom go), one for your motorcycle (Garmin zumo, tomtom rider) or a top of the range mobile phone (TomTom mobile, iPhone)/PDA (TomTom navigator) which will often include GPS.  A particular brand may have 3 or 4 different models with a variety of prices and features going from low-end to high-end.  Some have maps for more than one country or the capability of adding them (though this will cost extra). To add maps you will need a GPS unit with sufficient memory space and sometimes an SD memory card slot.  Some maps are considered better or weaker in some areas than others. Find out if the unit uses OpenStreetMap, Tele Atlas or Navtech.  Whether a unit supports speed camera warnings and live traffic information might be of interest to you.  If you buy a second hand unit, the maps may be neither updated nor able to update. Old units may have buttons rather than a touchscreen. Cheaper ones often have smaller screens too.  Most large stores, like BestBuy and Circuit City, don't give their employees commission to push a particular model, so you can usually depend on their suggestions and information.  Try eliminating brands you don't like, models that are too expensive, and units with features you don't want or need.

"Botulism in all its forms is a serious life threatening illness and requires immediate medical treatment. The sooner you get medical attention, the better your recovery. Call emergency services by calling 911 in North America.  Symptoms of foodborne botulism present 12 to 36 hours after eating contaminated food and include nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, blurred or double vision, slurred speech, drooping eyelids, dry mouth or difficulty swallowing or talking, sudden facial muscle weakness, trouble breathing, and paralysis. Foodborne botulism comes from environments with little oxygen, such as canned and bottled foods and foods fresh from the soil.Symptoms of infant botulism begin with constipation, floppy movements, drooping eyelids, weak cries, drooling and difficulty sucking or feeding, and paralysis. Infants contract botulism via spores that get into the intestinal tract and convert to toxins inside the body. Infants who develop botulism are typically between two to eight months of age and have ingested honey or soil.Symptoms of wound botulism are the same as in foodborne, except you will not have nausea, vomiting, or abdominal cramps. Spores can convert to toxins inside open wounds and are commonly found in cuts you haven’t noticed and intravenous drug users’ injection sites.Botulism does not increase blood pressure or heart rate or cause confusion. You may have a fever if you have wound botulism.;  , Antitoxin is one of the first lines of early defense in fighting botulism. Antitoxin cannot reverse damage already done but can reduce the risk of further complications and nerve damage. Antitoxin is delivered via a slow intravenous infusion.  Antitoxin is derived from horse serum so a skin sensitivity test will be done before administration.  Because the toxin in botulism weakens muscles to the point of paralysis, you can stop breathing. Medical treatment for botulism therefore usually includes time on a ventilator to help you breathe until the effects of the toxin have cleared your system. This could take several weeks., Medical treatment for foodborne botulism usually involves induced or forced vomiting and medications to cause bowel movements. The goal is to clear the food substance out of your system., Wound debridement is the removal of dead or infected tissue, thereby removing toxins in the wound if you have wound botulism.  ","get to a hospital immediately. be prepared to receive an antitoxin. expect respiratory treatment. anticipate vomiting and bowel movements. undergo wound cleansing and debridement. "

"If you are doing an activity that could cause you to injure your knees, such as a sport that could make you fall, then you should protect them before that happens. Wear knee pads whenever you are doing an activity that may involve a fall or pressure on your knees.  For example, volleyball players should use knee pads to protect their knees when they fall or dive for the ball.Knee pads can be useful for activities beyond sports. For example, if you like to spend a lot of time in your yard weeding, wear knee pads or use a cushioned pad to kneel on when you are on your knees.;  , There are certain kinds of motions that can put a lot of pressure on your knees. Sudden movements or direct pressure on the front or back of the knee can strain and injure the knee. This is especially true if you have an existing injury or illness in the knee, such as osteoarthritis.This means that you should be careful when lifting heavy objects. Be careful that you do not rotate while lifting, as this uses your knee abnormally under extreme pressure.  Also avoid using your knees in a way makes them overextend.

"First you have to decide which Tifa outfit you want, one from the games, or the one from advent children. When you’ve decided this, start researching. Look up pictures, get screen shots of her clothes from various angles that highlight the different elements you want to incorporate into your piece.;  , This will keep you from going overboard when you aren’t really ready to commit $200 into this. You have a variety of options for making the outfit.  Or, you can find the patterns you need, and sew it yourself, only buying accessories such as earrings, shoes and gloves.  The pros to this are that it usually saves time and money. However, it tends to look fake.  Find someone you know that sews. In some cases professional tailoring services may do this as well, but will be more pricey. Find the fabrics you want, threads, etc. and offer to pay for your friends time spent. Those that love to sew usually are just thrilled with the opportunity and the free fabric and may do it as a service. Don’t count on this though.  You can make the difference just by getting realistic and varied fabrics for each part of the outfit. For example, in FFVII AC you should notice that she has a sort of woolen apron in the front, with 6 buttons, attached by a belt to her back skirt that is made of a stiffer, smoother fabric. It cannot be stressed enough how much it helps if you really look like the character. With that said, we’ll turn to the second part: Details.  If you have short blond hair and blue eyes, reconsider. You’ll end up with a wig and contacts. Though you can’t do any thing about your facial features, see if you have a triangular face, but if not, find a way to create that effect. For makeup, Tifa has thick eye shadow, and medium long lashes, with a pale brown shadow across the eyelids. Her lips are very pale, and not glossy at all, so don’t try lipstick. If you have brunette hair, try a dye that only darkens it, but for paler hair, go with a brownish-black dye or a long wig with that color. The style of it is a side-sweep bang across the left eye, and longer bangs on the right that are half tucked behind her ear. The rest of it can either hang down, or be put into a red ponytail that is towards the end.  It should be noted in your research that her Advent Children boots have white heels, and a significant tread. (They are best seen during the fight scene)  , Tifa is a mature young woman who does care a lot about her comrades and beloved ones. Besides her revealing appearance, you will never hear a bad word from her. She is very gentle and shy, and speaks with her doings rather than her speech. Also, she takes problems much to heart, and often feels grief or sadness. She has difficulties showing her feelings to others, and because of her taciturnity she doesn't get well along Cloud, who is very withdrawn, too.

"A good drum set mic setup will include 2 overhead mics for capturing the sound of the kit as a whole. Listen to the audio from these microphones and examine the tone - is it bright and punchy or dark and warm? The tone from your overhead mics is crucial to adjusting your EQ, because it establishes a kind of overall constraint.  For example, if your overhead mics produce a bright, crisp sound, then trying to make each individual drum sound dark and warm will be a losing battle. In this way, you should use the tone produced by your overhead mics as the general template for the type of tone you aim for when adjusting the EQ for each drum.  EQ adjustment for the overhead mics should be minimal, but it often helps to roll off some of the low frequencies. This will make room for the floor tom and bass drum in these frequency bands.;  , Your microphone setup will vary, but generally you want to have dedicated mics for the snare drum, bass drum, and hi-hats. A single mic can be used for toms, and cymbals can be picked up solely through the overhead mics if desired.  When adjusting the equalization for the snare drum, roll off most of the low frequencies. The depth of a snare drum's sound can be adjusted by moving the faders for mid frequencies, and the bright 'crack' can be adjusted through the high frequencies. Adjust your hi-hat similarly, as they benefit from the same type of EQ treatment.  When adjusting the EQ for your bass drum and low toms, roll off some of the high frequencies. This will cause you to lose some of the drums' brightness, but will keep each drum out of the way of each other in the mix and improve the overall sound of your drum set.  Do not listen to each channel in solo mode while adjusting the EQ. If you adjust just the snare drum until it sounds perfect, for example, you may find that it sounds terrible when mixed back in with the rest of the drum set. Always adjust EQ with all of the channels playing.  In addition to rolling off the low end of your snare, high toms, and cymbals, consider using a high-pass filter in your mixing software. This will completely remove much of the low frequencies, which will allow the bass drum to occupy this sonic space without being crowded by other channels. This is a better way to improve your bass drum's presence than simply cranking the channel up.  If you are mixing music that includes guitars, pianos, or vocals, your mix will likely already be very crowded between about 250 and 500 hertz. Cutting these frequencies from your drums makes room for other instruments and cleans up the overall sound.  These middle frequencies can be more readily sacrificed on drums than on other instruments like guitars. Drums are chiefly valued in a mix for their high-frequency crack and their low-frequency 'oomph.'  ","examine the tone quality from your overhead mics. adjust the equalization for each individual mic. apply a high-pass filter to all channels except the bass drum. consider cutting some of the middle frequencies from your drum channels.

"Water is one of your skin's absolutely essential needs. Water flushes toxins out of your body and also improves circulation, both of which are helpful in the fight against acne. Drink water whenever you become thirsty. A good rule of thumb to use is looking at the color of your urine: if it's mostly clear, you've had enough water; if it's yellowish, aim to get more water in your diet., While fatty foods are often considered bad for acne, there are good fats that help fight acne. Omega-3 fatty acids help keep the skin flexible, which drains sebum out of the pores. This will cut down on the oil that is associated with acne.For good fats, eat nuts, cold-water fish, and avocados.  The body uses the amino acids from protein to produce collagen. This nutrient helps keep the skin healthy and hydrated.Good sources of protein include seafood, poultry, dairy products, and eggs, as well as beans and soy., This particular vitamin helps cut down on the oil your skin produces. Good sources include sweet potato, carrots, dark green vegetables, and sweet peppers., Sugar stimulates levels of insulin in your blood, which can in turn increase the amount of oil your skin produces. Limit your intake of junk foods and soft drinks to cut the amount of sugar in your system.  ","drink plenty of water throughout the day. eat enough good fats. include proteins in your diet. eat vitamin a. cut artificial sugars out of your diet. "
"Have a conversation with your partner about each of your values around money. Often, people inherit the beliefs, values, and attitudes around money from family.Before getting into the next argument about money, sit down and talk about how your partner relates to money.  Understanding your partner's attitudes and views might explain why he or she is hesitant to discuss money, or why he or she feels the urge to overspend. Whatever your partner's relationship to money, it is important for you to understand it clearly.  Ask your partner, “What did your parents or family members teach you about money? Can you remember your first memory involving money? Do you have any financial goals? Do you have any fears around money? Was your family fearful about money when you were a kid?”;  , If you have thoughts such as, “We’ll finally be financially okay once he stops overspending” or, “I’ll be happy once she changes her behavior,” recognize that you’re placing your happiness onto someone else only if he or she changes. Remind yourself that you are engaging in a false belief based on your own thinking; no one can “make” you happy, and no one can “make” you feel anything. This is an opportunity for you to face your own beliefs around money and any fears you may have. Resolve to explore your own relationship to money before demanding your partner to change.Ask yourself, “What is it I want my partner to change? How does this relate to my own beliefs on money? Is there something I need to change in how I relate to money?”  , If having “enough” money is the only thing that makes you or your partner feel secure, you may find that it causes constant worry and conflict in the relationship. If you perceive your partner spending money on an unnecessary item as a threat to your relationship or a threat to your own security, it may be time to reflect on your relationship with money.Ask yourself, “What makes me feel secure? How does money play a role in me feeling secure? When do I know I have enough money? When is it okay to spend more money than expected?”  , If one partner handles the day-to-day spending and the other partner deals with long-term savings, this can cause problems in the relationship. This kind of task division can cause conflicts. If you want to handle one job at a time, consider switching roles each month by one person handling daily expenses while the other handles investments, then switching.You can also share the roles equally. Set a time each month to pay bills, discuss spending, and look over savings. Plan something fun to do together afterward, such as going to a movie or going bowling. This way, the money talk will feel less like a chore and you will have something to look forward to afterward.  If your current situation isn’t working well or causes many difficulties, approach banking in a new way. For example, you can share one bank account (used for paying bills, household expenses, groceries, and vacations, and cars) and then have separate accounts for your own personal spending. Be creative in finding an approach that works for you and that minimizes conflict., When you first fall in love, you may throw caution to the wind and spend money on special experiences together. Yet, before you know it, you may run out of money which can lead to conflict. Find a realistic way to budget that both of you agree upon. You may work with a financial planner, create a budget on your own, or use an online/smartphone application to track your spending.While nobody likes to budget, it can be helpful to track your spending for a month to see where the money goes. After that month, see your “money pits” and figure out a plan to spend money more meaningfully the next month. Slowly allocate your money to places you’d rather spend it.  Instead of accusing each other of bad spending habits, learn to live within your means. Don’t take out any debt that isn’t necessary. If you want a big purchase, save up for it. If you feel an impulse to buy something, tell yourself to wait one day (or one week) before you buy it. Make it a goal not to fall into debt.By living within your means, you can avoid future problems that could threaten your relationship.  If you are in debt, you may want the advice of a financial planner. Make it a priority to get out of debt as fast as you can.  For more information, check out How to Get Out of Debt.  If you have problems with your credit, you may consider seeing a credit counselor. You can find help for managing debt and creating a budget. You may also enroll in a debt management program (DMP), which can help you manage your debts. Some creditors will waive or lower fees. Many credit unions, universities, and military bases offer services for credit counseling.Ask what services are offered and how payments work. Some places offer payment plans.  Don’t spend money just to spite your partner or “get back” at him or her. If your relationship gets to this point, it’s likely the relationship is in a state of neglect and needs attention. Don’t use money as a weapon.Recognize that vindictive spending does not help you manage money in a positive way. Change your approach by talking about these financial decisions one-by-one, and coming to a solution together.  If your partner makes a financial decision that you do not agree with, don’t try to get revenge. Ask yourself, “What is this accomplishing? Is getting revenge helping us move forward as a couple?”  , Instead of interrupting your partner when he or she speaks, listen to everything being said. Don’t plan what to say next or think of a comeback. Just listen and wait for your turn to speak. This shows respect and can help you better understand your partner.It can also help prevent arguments by not jumping to conclusions about what your partner did or why he or she did it. Engaged listening can prevent fights by fully understanding your partner.  Look your partner in the eyes, keep your body language engaged, and asked questions. You can say, “Is there anything else you’d like to say?” before moving on.  For more information, check out How to Communicate Effectively .  Perhaps a hidden expense is exposed or your partner makes a large purchase without asking you first. Your first reaction may be to blame your partner or jump on the defensive. If blame is a normal part of your interactions, recognize that casting constant blame can be abusive. If you are feeling blamed, tell your partner how you feel without pointing the blame back.Instead of blaming, use “I” statements. While blaming is often an accusation, you can learn to state your own feelings and concerns without blaming your partner.For example, instead of saying, “That purchase you made set us back and now we can’t afford our vacation,” say, “I wish you would have told me about that purchase beforehand. I’m sad that it’s affecting us now, and will affect our vacation together.”  , A psychologist or therapist can help you and your partner when your own efforts have failed. Working with a therapist can help you and your partner relate to each other better when discussing finances and break out of unhealthy patterns. Find a marriage or couple’s therapist, who specialize in working with couples in conflict.For more information, check out How to Attend Couples Counseling.

"If your baby prefers the other parent, try to play with them more. Instead of putting them in a walker or playpen, or trying to get them to play alone, get down on the floor and play a game with them. Let the child lead the playing, and follow along with them.If your child resists playing with you, then you might want to try getting down on the ground a few feet away from them and just playing alone. Try playing with some Legos or get out a bottle of bubbles and start blowing them. After a little while, your child may approach you and start playing with you.  If your child is older, watch them as they play and ask if you can join. You may say something like, “That tea party looks really fun. Can I join?” or “I love swinging.

"Try not to smile when proposed to, or at least not to beam and look excited. If your mate has gone as far as to pop the question, they are assuming you will say yes, and your smiling will only confirm their hopefulness, which will make the shock of your rejection greater. Look in your partner's eyes tenderly, put your hand over theirs, and give your response in a gentle voice.  If you are in public when proposed to, ask your suitor to stand up (if necessary), and give them a gentle hug. This is a way to acknowledge that you're touched by your partner's gesture, without saying yes. Hopefully, it is enough to make anyone who's watching lose interest and go back to doing whatever they were doing, which will help ease any embarrassment for your mate.  If people are still watching, take your partner by the hand and quietly ask to go somewhere more private.  Never say yes just to get out of the situation so you can give your real response later. This will just make the later rejection more painful.  This guide assumes you like the person proposing; if your ex from three years ago leaps out of the bushes holding a ring, 'say no and get out of there' is all the advice you need. But if the suitor has reason to be hopeful, it's best to break the news gently, without being misleading. Say something appreciative, but keep it short so you can get to your response:  'That's such a moving request. I need time to think about it; it's not something I'd feel right saying yes to straight away. It's a bit of a surprise for me - would you mind if I take some time to think it over?'  'Thanks, that's incredibly wonderful of you but I have so many questions that I've yet to ask you that I'm not sure of our future compatibility yet. Maybe this is a good time for us to sit down and talk about what spending a life together would look like.'  'I love you for asking that, but I don't plan on getting married (for a while / ever). We could move in together instead?'  'I'm honored that you've proposed to me. You're a kind, caring (man / woman). I wish I could say otherwise, but I can't see our marriage working out, and I have to say no.'  , It's likely that the person proposing has put in a lot of effort to asking, thinking through the depths of why they want to spend the rest of their life with you. Letting down their unhappiness gently isn't going to be easy, but there are ways you can help the process:  Give each other space if either of you feels angry or too upset to talk. Let your partner know you'll be contacting them soon (preferably the same day or next morning), but give them time to think until then.  Suggest the two of you do something you both love doing. If your partner wants affection from you, spend the rest of the day together doing something that keeps your occupied. This will serve as a distraction and it will help the other person realize that you still care.  In private, and once neither of you are actively upset at each other, explain at length what the situation is. Emphasize that your relationship still matters a great deal to you. Describe exactly why you're not prepared to accept. Don't let the other person think it's because they're not good enough.  If you have doubts about the relationship itself, not just marriage, be honest about this. It may not be the best time to air your grievances, but let your partner know that there are problems to discuss once you've both calmed down.  Things can get really awkward from this point, or they can pick up as usual with good, caring approaches to continuing to nurture your love and relationship. If the proposer is able to accept your position (whether that's an alternative to marriage or delaying the decision for now), then the relationship will likely remain strong and forge on. On the other hand, if this rejection opens a rift in your relationship and causes suspicion, anger, resentment, or discomfort, it may be time to reassess the purpose of staying together. Unless it's clear that the relationship has ended, take a few weeks to sort through the post-proposal emotions before making a drastic decision.  Telling your partner that you'll say 'yes, if...' is not about love or reasonable compromise. You may end up in the same situation a year from now, full of resentment that you backed yourself in a corner. Instead, ask for more time to work out what it is that makes you want to reply conditionally. Most likely your real answer is 'no,' and you should only alter this answer if you have a genuine change of heart.

"Whether you're male or female, long hair is the norm. This is mainly because you're not going to bother getting it cut!

Black walls can make a room look dark, small, and dreary, so it needs to be done very well!;  , This is useful if you aren’t able to paint your walls, such as in a college dorm or a rented apartment. Do a Google search to easily find removable wall art. Amazon is a great resource. Choose something like the iconic Eiffel Tower, a scene from a French café, French script, or all of the above. There are hundreds of options, and luckily they aren’t very expensive!  Hanging posters can add a bit of fun to plain walls as well.  You can be creative with these. A faux fur rug can add a dash of glamor to your room, while a patterned rug can add an element of high fashion fun. A solid colored rug will let your Paris-themed accent pieces stand out, but a floral rug can add a soft, romantic touch to your bedroom. Be creative and choose a rug that fits the specific Parisian vibe you are going for!  These rugs will also help make your room much more cozy, especially if you have hard floors.  This will be the centerpiece of your bedroom, so it’s important to find one you really love. Upholstered headboards look girly and romantic, while wrought iron beds look delicate and chic. If you’re unable to buy a new bed, don’t worry— the perfect bedding can turn any bed into a cozy little piece of Paris.  If your walls are painted a sweet pastel color, top your bed with a black and white patterned, or a plain white, comforter. This will create a beautiful contrast.  If your walls are a stark white or black, choose a colored comforter. Just make sure that, somehow, your bedding and your walls create a nice contrast between solid neutrals and color.  You can certainly be creative with this. If you have a plain wooden night stand, paint it the same color as your walls for a pop of color that ties the room together. A delicate, wrought-iron side table can mimic the look of a Parisian café table, and would look ultra-sophisticated in your Parisian room.  If you don’t want to purchase a new Paris-inspired side table and aren’t able to repaint the one you have, consider draping a beautiful fabric over the side table, like a tablecloth. Voila— a perfect Parisian night table.  Vanities are glamorous and sophisticated, and tie in perfectly with a Parisian themed room. You can find these online at stores like Pottery Barn and Crate and Barrel, but don’t be afraid to scout Goodwill, garage sales, and vintage stores as well. With a coat of paint and a little TLC, you can bring a cheap, rickety vanity back to life.  Set your makeup and perfume bottles on your vanity. This way the vanity serves a purpose and provides a spot for you to get ready, but looks chic and Parisian at the same time!  , Real flowers can make your bedroom smell delicious, but fake flowers look great and last forever. Roses are all over Paris in the springtime, and they will make your bedroom look stylish and elegant. Peonies, daffodils, irises, and tulips are also Parisian flowers, and would look great in a Paris-themed bedroom., Don’t underestimate how much the perfect curtains can transform a room. Choose something soft and romantic, like a sheer fabric or one with ruffles or lace. These add a touch of elegance to your Parisian room, while also blocking the light so you can get your beauty sleep.  You can find Paris-themed accent pillows at various home décor stores, like Bed, Bath, and Beyond, Pottery Barn, WalMart, and Target. These are cheap accent pieces that can really bring together your Parisian theme. Opt for a mix of colored pillows and black and white pillows of different shapes and sizes. Romantic pillows like lips and hearts look great, especially mixed with pillows of French phases and images. Throw in a couple of black and white striped or polka-dotted pillows, and your bed will be looking very Parisian., This is the cherry on top of a Parisian bedroom. Not only do chandeliers add soft light to your bedroom, but they are a classic and stylish fixture. You can find miniature chandeliers meant specifically for bedrooms on various home décor websites. Just make sure that the bottom of the chandelier is no lower than seven feet, so adults avoid bumping their heads!, A fashion bust to hang your jewelry on will make your room look very high-fashion and classy.

"Is there a crawl space or basement below the floor? If there is a crawl space, then you will have to work with the jacks while laying down. If it's the basement, then jacks while standing up.  , Draw on some paper a floor diagram and indicate what direction the floor is leaning. This will help a lot when the jacking begins., Generally there are posts and beams under the floor joists. If a pier that the post is standing on has sunk into the ground you will need to lift the beam off the post and replace the post with a taller one., Place the jack (I prefer at least 25 ton hydraulic. or a house screw jack) on the plywood and then I use a piece of thick hardwood between the jack's ram and the beam to prevent damage to the beam. If two beams meet on the post that is sunk then a jack on both sides of the post is required., Check the floor regularly to make sure you do not over level it., Once the floor is brought to level you check all around to see if there is any other areas that are still low. This is done by placing the level on the floor in several different positions and areas as before., Cut a replacement post of the same dimension lumber that was removed. You can go larger lumber but never smaller. But the best is to go with the same dimension. Also it is not a good idea to try to raise the pier block up by placing more dirt under it and then putting the old post back in. You aren't going to be able to compact the soil enough to keep it from sinking back down under the weight of the house., This will ensure moisture doesn't come up through the concrete and get to the wood. If the reason the floor sank is due to a rotten post and there was no tar paper you can now see what happens. Now put the weight of the house on the post. Keep it lined up with the sides of the beam. Check the floor for level again to make sure you're still good., Once the post is replaced it needs to be fastened to the beam. If the beam and the post is the same width (they should be) then just nail a 2X4 piece on both sides of the beam down the side of the post and nail to the post. Then you fully remove the jacks and lumber they sat on and put them away. You're done!  ","determine where the floors supports are.put a level on the floor in several different positions in the affected room to determine which way the floor is leaning. check the perimeter of the room to see if there are any additional areas that are out of level. get the jacks under the floor. place a couple of two foot long pieces of 2x6 lumber side by side on the ground under the beam and place a 3/4' plywood 1'x1' on top of the 2x6's. begin jacking up the beam or beams and make sure you jack equally with two beams. look for low areas. remove the old post and measure the distance between the beam and the pier. place a piece of tar paper on top of the concrete pier and the new post on top of the paper. fasten.

"You usually know what your class is going to be about because your teacher assigned you some kind of material ahead of time. As you are getting to class, think about what you will be covering that day, mentally preparing yourself for the time ahead. This process will get you in the right frame of mind and help you absorb information better., If you're in high school, you really don't have the option not to show up, but in college, you're in charge of your own time. One of the easiest ways to earn good grades without studying much is to show up to your classes and listen to what your teacher has to say. That means not just showing up but being attentive as well.In addition, many professors will make attendance and participation a part of your grade. Therefore, just attending will contribute to you making better grades. If you don't show up enough, you lose those points., It may be tempting to sit in the back row, out of sight and mind of your professor. However, you'll be better able to see what your professor is writing on the board at the front, and you'll be able to hear her better. You'll also be less tempted to let your mind wander.  If you're confused about something, don't be afraid to ask a question. Your teacher will be happy to shed some light on what's confusing you, and other students will likely have the same question.  It may sound difficult to do, especially if the subject is something you don't like, such as math. However, start out by feigning interest, if you have to. Psych yourself up, saying how much you love math. Try to find parts of it that do interest you, even if it's a small part. Being interested in what you're learning helps you to take in information more effectively., Your teacher will likely clue you in to what's important by writing main ideas on the board or emphasizing it with her voice. She may even repeat the main ideas to make sure the class is understanding what's important. Constantly be asking yourself what the main ideas and main points are, so that you are using your time in class to think about and absorb the ideas., Taking good notes does not mean writing down every word your teacher says. In fact, that often means you aren't absorbing the information, just re-writing it on the page. You also won't be able to keep up, unless you are taking notes on a computer and can type very fast. Therefore, it's best to write down notes with a few words or short sentences that capture the main points.For instance, if your teacher says, 'We're talking about verbs today. Verbs are the action of the sentence. There are two main types of verbs, being and action verbs.' You could write: 'Verbs: action of sentence. 2 types: being, action.'  It's a good idea to use shorthand or abbreviations to make your writing faster, but be sure to be consistent so that you always know what you wrote.Though you can capture more with a computer, studies have shown that taking notes by hand actually helps you learn more than taking notes on a computer., It's tempting to stop being interested if the room is too hot or people are talking. Maybe the day is really nice outside, or you just don't feel like being there. Commit yourself to paying attention. Block out what's distracting you, and focus only on what the teacher is saying and the class discussion.Everybody's mind wanders sometime. When you find yourself drifting away, bring your focus back to what your teacher is saying.  If you absolutely cannot focus or you find yourself going to sleep, try going to the bathroom for a short break to splash water on your face, if your teacher will let you.  If you hand-wrote your notes, try typing your notes when you get back home. Typing them will reinforce the information in your brain, helping it to stick for longer. If you typed your notes in class, try re-reading them when you get back home.  ","think about the material before you come to class. go to class. sit in the front row. ask questions. be interested. always look for the main points. take good notes. don't get distracted. type or review your notes after class.

"You can rank the relative importance of each job characteristic by using a scale from one (highest priority) to ten (lowest priority).  If your list has more than ten characteristics, you can continue ranking in ascending order from highest to lowest priority.  For instance, you could write the number one beside the salary range you decide upon to indicate this characteristic as your number one priority.;  , Consider whether you want to be doing the same type of work you are currently doing or something a little different. If you are a carpenter and spent most of your time in your last position doing framing, consider whether you would like to be framing at your next job or if you would prefer to spend more time on finishing work, cabinetry, or other types of carpentry.  Reflect on the salary you want to be earning at your next job. Consider the salary you made in your last few positions and whether you want to be earning a similar or a higher salary., Think about the qualities you want to see in your next boss. Reflect on the qualities of your last supervisor and which of those qualities you would hope to find (or not) in your next supervisor.  If your last supervisor offered little or poor feedback about your performance, consider whether you want your next supervisor to be more proficient in offering constructive feedback.  Think about the opportunities for advancement or professional development you hope to see in your next position. Ponder whether there are specific areas of professional development that you would hope find at your next position, such as funding for professional conferences.  You can search for corporate values by looking at mission statements and “about us” pages on company websites or by talking to former or current employees at professional conferences and events.  For example, you can look at mission statements on company websites. Reading the mission statements, search for keywords that relate to the values you are looking for such as “personal growth” or “professional development.”  For example, if you want a job that values professional development opportunities, you should look for one that promotes this on their website.  If you want one that values work-life balance, you should look for this quality on their website. , Whereas some companies do a lot to promote social relationships in the workplace with perks like weekend retreats, others have a more hands off approach. You should make sure the corporate culture is a good fit for what you want in your career and whether it fits your lifestyle.  Explore the ‘About us’ or ‘Values’ pages of the company website. This should give you an initial sense of whether they value things that you are looking for in a company.Explore the ‘Careers’ page on the organization website. This can help you figure out if the culture is a good fit for you.  Set up a Google news alert for the company. This will help you get a sense of the values the company promotes to the public and how it is perceived in the news media.  Think about the kind of work-life balance you need and whether the corporate culture will support that balance in your life.Consider your current and future plans. For example, if you plan on having a child in the near future, then you might consider whether the company allows for telecommuting or flexible hours.  Common review websites include Glassdoor and Vault.If you find trends in the reviews that raise red flags for you, you might want to look elsewhere. At the same time, remember to take the reviews with a grain of salt. Many reviews may be written by either disgruntled or new employees.Company review websites also often include information about similar companies that you might be interested in applying to.  Observe the values promoted in their Facebook posts and whether they align with your values. Next, look at profiles of people who work at the company on Linkedin. Decide whether these are people you would like to work with.If you place a high value on work-life balance and you find a lot of posts that indicate the company values workhorse or nose to the grindstone type employees who work every weekend, perhaps the company values do not align with yours.  If you value social and environmental sustainability and you cannot find any posts relating to sustainability, perhaps the company does not have the same values as you.  Talking with other people who work at the company is one of the best ways to determine if it is a good place to work. Talk to them about the company to figure out if it is a good fit for you. If it seems like a good fit, you can use the contact to help you get ready for the big interview.Ask them about what it’s like to work there, such as whether it is expected to work late and whether they give you free meals or other fringe benefits.You might ask: How do you feel about the company? Do you feel like it offers good opportunities for advancement? Are you happy with how they treat you?

"Now that you know you learn by seeing and watching, utilize this knowledge. Write down what you hear, translating the aural into the visual.  If your teacher shows you a movie or is talking about specific points on a test, write it down. After you write it down, look over it twice. Start speaking your brain's preferred language.  If your teacher uses slides while lecturing, it's important to concentrate on the slides. You'll be less likely to remember what he/she said, but you will remember what you saw on the screen.  Take what you're trying to learn and let your eyes use it. This may involve an extra step, but your test scores will certainly lap it up.  Did your professor just say English was 30% French, 30% Latin, 25% Germanic, and 15% other? Great! Pie chart it is! Now, what color do you associate with each?  Hone your artsy side.

Every teacher will stress, 'Don't write down everything I say! You'll get so far behind!' Well, you're not an aural learner anyway, so why would you remember what they said?  If your teacher goes much too fast for you to write anything legible, ask them for notes or an outline on their materials. They will love your enthusiasm.  You could always write what you learned on wikiHow!  ","use written materials and exercises. use boards, models, and flip charts. take good notes. "
"If your shoes are made of a delicate material like satin or silk, you should not clean them in a washing machine. The machine could potentially damage the shoes. Always wash satin shoes by hand., Look inside the satin shoe to see if there is a label with laundering instructions. There also might be instructions on the shoebox. You can also try contacting the manufacturer directly and ask them for instructions. If you locate instructions, follow them., Take a soft bristled brush and gently brush loose dirt from the shoes. Try using a brush with soft, nylon bristles. Make sure you remove all the loose dirt. Any debris or dirt left on the shoe will be rubbed further into the fabric when you clean the shoes.

"Most people who work in the garden work for at least 45 minutes to an hour at a time, walking, raking, weeding and more. In the off season, find a way to walk, swim, use an elliptical or bicycle to keep your heart and lungs trained for gardening.;  , These are the abdominal, oblique (side), transverse abdominis (underlying) and back muscles. They support you as you bend, twist, pick up or complete almost any gardening activity.  Lay on your back with knees bent. Tighten your core muscles. The curve in your back should flatten slightly toward the ground. Pick up 1 knee at a time and put it back down. Pick up the opposite knee and put it back down. Repeat this motion for 60 seconds and add your opposite arms when you are ready. Do this every other day in the gardening 'off-season.'  , To get into the practice of bending at the knees, rather than at the waist, do the following every other day.  Put on athletic shoes that have some grip. Keep your back straight and your weight in your heels. Bend your knees and squat as low as you can without breaking form, and then repeat 10 to 12 times. Do 2 to 3 sets, increasing repetitions as your gluteal, hamstring and quadricep muscles get stronger.  Another way to do this, if you have any lower back problems, is to use a medium to large resistance ball. Place the ball on the wall, behind your back. The curve of your back should fit into the curve of the ball. Flex your core muscles and lean back into the ball as you squat. Do 10 to 12 repetitions and 2 to 3 sets.  Get a resistance band of light resistance, which is available in most sports stores.  To do a bicep curl, put on your athletic shoes. Place the middle of the band beneath 1 of your feet. Curl the ends around your hands until the band is taught when your arms are straight. Raise your forearms until they are at a 90 degree angle and slowly lower them. Do 10 to 15 repetitions in 2 to 3 sets.  To do a tricep curl, hook the resistance band around a doorknob or shut the band into the low part of the door itself. Curl the ends of the band around your arms so they are taught with your arms at your sides. With legs at hip-distance apart, step forward with 1 foot (0.3 m) and flex your core muscles. Keep your arms straight and bring them up as high as you can, and then slowly bring your arms down. Do 10 to 15 repetitions in 2 to 3 sets.  Gardening uses biceps, triceps, quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, abdominal and more muscles. Developing a stretching routine that you will continue into the gardening season will help you to avoid muscle strain and arthritic pain.  Do a hamstring stretch. Lay on the floor with your back straight. Lift each knee individually and hug it into your chest for 10 seconds. Repeat with the other knee. Stay on the ground and hook a towel underneath your foot. With the help of your arms, bring 1 leg as straight up as possible with your back and head on the ground. Repeat with the opposite leg.  Do a quadricep stretch. Stand next to a wall. Bend 1 knee back and grasp it with your hand. Pull lightly on your foot and you should feel a pull in your front thigh. Hold for 10 seconds and then repeat with the second side.  Do a chest stretch. Stand in a narrow doorway. Bend your elbows and place them on the inner sides of the door. Step forward 1 step. You should feel a pull in your chest and armpit. Hold for 30 seconds. Raise or lower your arms to stretch more of the muscle.  Do a gentle twist. Lay on your back with your knees bent and arms out to the sides and let your knees fall to the left side. Bring your arms to your right side. Rest in this position for 30 seconds. Bring your knees and arms back to a neutral position and then switch sides.

"Be close, but try to give yourself enough room to maneuver your hands. Let your hands fall forward. With your fingers pointing at a downward angle, slowly move your hands next to the dryer opening.  Jet air dryers are motion activated, so air flow will start once your hand movement is detected. Try to make this movement swift. Sometimes, slower movements will not be detected.  Be sure to lower both hands entirely. You want to make sure that the air surrounds your wrists and hands.  Gently raise both hands upward until they are almost out of the air stream. Move them in a way that allows them to brush against the airflow.  When the airflow hits your fingertips, place your hands back into the airflow. You want your hands to be thoroughly covered.  Repeat these motions until your hands are completely dry. You may even want to turn your hands so that your palms are facing upwards. This will ensure that both sides of your hands are dry.

"Whatever your circumstances, there has to be one main, stand-out reason. Whether that person just isn't right for you or if you're just not ready, be honest with yourself and develop your own reasoning for not wanting to date. That way, you'll be in a good position to explain yourself and won't feel as if you have to give false reasons to accept or avoid dating.;  , At some point in time, you may meet a person and think that you could possibly develop feelings for them as you're getting to know each other. Be honest with yourself about what you want, and whether or not you're ready to become emotionally intimate with another person. Either way, you can become friends with this person at a later point in time when you may be ready for a relationship.  You may find that the friendship you've shared so far will add depth and meaning to your relationship. But, if you do not intend or want it to ever blossom into an intimate relationship, that's okay, too. Being honest with that person about your expectations for the relationship and your intentions is the best thing you can do, but remember to use your words appropriately.  Use the 'Golden Rule' when deciding how to tell someone you're not interested.  Sometimes you'll get that annoying question: 'Why are you, or why do you choose to be single?' Be prepared to answer it in a way you feel comfortable with, but don't feel as though you have to answer in detail. Something simple like: 'I want some time to discover myself,' or 'I don't need a relationship to be content,' works fine, too. But not having even a simple explanation can make the interested person feel as though they have a fatal flaw. And even if that is the case, there's no reason to tear that person apart.  Spend time with friends and family or gain a new hobby/invest more time in a current one. You'll learn that you are capable of doing activities that you enjoy on your own.  When you are ready to date and get into a relationship, you'll have your own interests to keep you busy in your partner's absence, or you'll have a great passion to share with them. Remember that you are your own person!  , The bonus is that these people will likely share more interests with you; the downside is that you may feel compelled to connect romantically. However, there is no universal law saying that you must be in a relationship with someone you share interests with. Instead, take this opportunity to make some great friends and do some serious networking, especially if you see this hobby turning into a career path.  Being friendly and being flirty can sometimes be perceived as the same thing, but you should never let someone make you feel guilty or pressured into a relationship because they misread your signals. But also be clear to the interested person about your intentions at that point so that they cannot further misread your signals. If they continue to be persistent and you're not interested, it's probably time to ask yourself if the friendship is worth putting effort into.  If you find yourself in a situation where you've been asked on a date, and don't feel ready to, make it clear to the interested person that you don't want to be in a relationship. Turn them down politely, with a legitimate reason, otherwise you risk hurting their feelings--especially if you want to be friends. Or, instead of declining a date for the two of you, you could suggest inviting friends to join your activity together. Be clear though that it is not a date, and make sure the interested person understands your intentions.  If they like you as a person, then nothing should have changed in your relationship. If they get mad or upset with you, remember; it's not your fault! Try leaving them alone for a few days so that they can cool off. If they care for you and understand you, they will not let it affect your friendship. Try not to scared away easily. You can still remain friends after turning someone down, but you should always be sensitive to whether or not the other person is willing to continue the friendship, despite their intimate feelings towards you.  Don't pressure them or make them feel guilty about maintaining the friendship if they are uncomfortable with only remaining friends.  If you sense a person is starting to take an interest in you, make sure that you are clear from the start that nothing more than a friendship will be possible. Do not lead them on to stroke your own ego because that can definitely hurt any chances of remaining friends. But don't apologize for being friendly either. Some people may misinterpret friendly behavior as interest, which is why it's important to be clear about your intentions using both verbal language and body language.  Don't stay friends with people who persistently ask you out if you don't feel ready. If you remain friends with such people, you are likely going to end up committing yourself or hurting the other person.  It's okay if dating isn't number one in your priority list. Just have fun and enjoy life to the fullest. Sometimes it's great to be single!  , You of all people know what you're ready for, and feeling pressured to find a mate can be emotionally draining. Tell your close friends and family members about your choice to stay single and your reasoning behind it so that they don't continue to harass you. Otherwise, those people may assume to know your reasoning, which can complicate things even further.  If you had a traumatic experience that has influenced your choice to stay single, do not bear the weight of that incident alone. Reach out to trusted family and friends to help you work through what happened, and/or see a therapist or psychiatrist. Keeping a private journal can also help you work through the experience and overcome it, but do not be fooled: unresolved traumatic experiences can fester over time and create new or worsening problems like anxiety, depression, and PTSD. Do some research to find the best options for your recovery so that you can live a more enjoyable and peaceful life.  Don't forget that there are three outcomes to any intimate relationship: marriage, long-term commitment, or a breakup. Don't date unless you feel prepared for any of the above scenarios. Don't let society's expectations (or your mom's opinion) make you feel like you're a weirdo for wanting some time to date yourself. Embrace your freedom!  , If you are in a relationship where you are friends with someone but they want to date you, just remember that if you don't want to date them keep it in the friend zone. If they are truly your friend, they will understand. If you have been asked to date but you don't want to, tell them you'd rather be friends for now and not jump into things so quickly.

"Each school or organization has its own guidelines for length and font. While some personal interest statements ask specific questions they want you to answer, others are wide open for you to write whatever you wish.  These kinds of formatting requirements usually aren’t very complicated. Typically, they mandate the use of a common font in a specific size, with an additional specification for the margins around the page. It’s important to follow these instructions—they’re not always nitpicking—because the admissions team wants the document to easily transfer across platforms.;  , Transcripts, resumes or CVs, job histories, and applications are all important documents to have in front of you. This will help you remember extracurricular activities, personal experiences, work experiences, classes, and more.  Avoid making your personal interest statement a restatement of your resume. Over the course of application season, the admissions officer will read hundreds of personal interest statements, most of which will be poorly written and interchangeable. The point of gathering these documents is to jog your memories of your successes and failures and what you learned from each, not to provide a narrative account of your academic career., There are a few consistent ways personal statements are organized. They are organized around a single event, a series of events to illustrate a theme, or an account of the general personal journey that put you in a position to send in an application.Single event narratives recount something in your life that was the proximate cause (or but-for cause) of your academic goal. For instance, “After my grandmother was swindled out of her house, I knew I wanted to be a lawyer” recounts the event that spurred you to go to law school--but for your grandmother getting swindled, you wouldn’t have pursued a legal education.  Series of events narratives use multiple occurrences to illustrate a personal quality you think is important or the proximate cause of your goal. Perseverance, for example, is not a quality that can be demonstrated by simply writing about one event. You’ll have to tell the story of more than one event in order to show how you persevere.  Try to avoid general personal journey narratives if you can. They have a tendency to slip into a restatement of your resume. Instead, try to turn those narratives into series of events narratives, sticking to milestones and highlights.  ","look over the requirements for your personal statement. gather materials. brainstorm possible themes and answers. "
"Given how easy it is to be online all the time, you've probably stopped counting the hours and noting when you're doing internet things rather than offline things.

"If someone is following you, touching you, or you feel threatened, don't be afraid to seek help. Find a friend or authority figure who may be able to help you. Don't confront someone if you think they may become violent or aggressive--just get away from them and get help.If someone is following you on the street, try slipping into a coffee shop. Find another woman and tell her you are being followed, and ask if she minds if you sit with her for a minute or if she can act like she's your friend. The harasser will see you joining your friend and probably go away. If you're still worried, call the police.  These people are looking for your attention--good or bad--and ignoring them denies them what they want.If you feel you need to respond, stay calm, look directly at them, and don't swear or call them names.Say something like, 'Repeat what you just said to me,''Stop harassing women,' or 'Show some respect.'If they insult you or become defensive, don't respond.

"If you are not feeling good, ponder what it is you are thinking that is causing you to feel bad. Work that Subject over in your mind until you have a new thought that raises your vibration. Your feelings are a built-in barometer for how you are vibrating.;  , If you have a pattern of thinking the same way about a particular subject matter—money, health, relationships—you will find that you have ingrained beliefs that are coming up whenever that subject matter comes to mind. Those beliefs can be empowering or they can be dis-empowering ones. Taking a look at your existing circumstances gives you a glimpse as to your overall vibration because whatever you are living - is a reflection of that. That is a good place to start in re-thinking your beliefs.  Counting on others to behave a certain way in order for you to be happy is a trap. Just like you cannot jump through all the various hoops required in order to make the people close to you happy—the same thing applies to you being able to accommodate all those demands. Take charge of your life and understand that you can be happy no matter what others are doing. It just takes a different perspective. Happier people attract more circumstances to be happy about.  Stop fretting over all the perceived mistakes you have made. The other people involved in those situations are most likely not even still thinking about what happened. And if they are, it is because they have not been willing to give up that incident in favor of being happy now. Whatever happened, happened. Get over it.

"Tea is very calming. Drinking hot tea while you study or while you take a break from studying can help you feel more relaxed and less stressed.

"It’s much easier to organize a demonstration for a cause many people believe in and understand. For example, “the government is bad” is too vague, but “the state government has cut funding for education” is specific enough to attract supporters., Most demonstrations are going to be too big to organize on your own.

Look for committee members at other demonstrations, online groups dedicated to your cause, and among your social circle.  Ask potential committee members if they have experience organizing demonstrations. It’s not a requirement, but previous experience will definitely help!  Try to organize a diverse committee. This will help your event be inclusive and aware of issues you might not consider, such as disability access., Picketing is a group of people holding signs and marching in front of a specific location while chanting loudly. This is good for smaller, local protests focused against something very specific, like a business accused of mistreating workers.  Vigils consist of people standing quietly at a specific location, often at night while holding candles. This kind of event is good for large or small groups, and is especially useful for larger, symbolic causes, like ending community violence.  Sit-ins involve a group of people walking into a space and refusing to leave until their demands are met. Sit-ins are more controversial, and are best for smaller groups with very specific demands, like the resignation of a public official.  Marches are organized groups of people disrupting traffic by walking a planned route through a city. Marches are best for very large groups, and work well for general, nationwide causes, like a disputed election., Daytime weekend events in the spring and summer months are best for gathering the largest groups, but if your cause is tied to a specific event like an election, time it as closely to the event as possible. Locations should be in easy-to-find places and in an area with high traffic, like an urban park, the main street of town, or the front gates of a university., Protests can’t happen without money, so start planning right away for expenses! Be flexible with your budget--if your event grows unexpectedly, so will your costs.  Permits may cost money in some areas. Check ahead of time to be sure.  Megaphones and sound systems will be needed at even small protests.  Supplies for signs and banners can add up quickly.  Large events will require food, water, and public facilities.  If you are supporting a controversial cause or live in an area with significant unrest, a legal defense or medical expenses fund may be a good idea., Most jurisdictions require you to obtain a permit before holding a protest--check with your city government for local requirements. You might also have to get permission from additional authorities, such as the police, university administration, or the parks department., A powerful public speaker can energize your protest and win bystanders over to your cause. A speaker doesn’t have to be somebody famous.Try asking leaders of local activist groups, university professors, union leaders, and even members of the organizing committee., Your friends probably have similar beliefs--talk to them about your protest! Get your friends and family involved first, but respect their wishes if they choose not to join in., Don’t just focus your publicity on worldwide social media platforms. Make sure people in the immediate area know what’s going on! Put up flyers at the protest location, ask local businesses to put a flyer in their window, and post to neighborhood-specific online groups., Set up a public page and link it across multiple social media platforms to reach the largest possible audience.  Be clear and concise! Your page should have an easy-to-find FAQ with basic information like time and location.  Update your page regularly, especially if the date or location changes!  Assign someone to moderate the page, especially if your cause is controversial., Having the local news at your protest will attract attention and interest, and will spread your cause further! Call or email your local newspaper or station--they are interested in local events and will want to know about your protest. Be sure to tell them the time, date, location, and cause., The event will be much easier to set up if everybody has an assigned task. Important jobs for a demonstration can be helping people find the location, updating the event page during the protest, coordinating food and water deliveries, setting up a sign-making party, and picking up litter after the demonstration ends., Be sure your protest site is visible to oncoming traffic, is on level ground, and is accessible for ambulances and fire trucks. If your protest is controversial or there has been unrest in your area, check to be sure your supporters are safe from physical attack by making sure they have an escape route and are clearly visible to the public., This is a great opportunity to have fun with your supporters. You can organize a casual get-together with everyone to make signs, or encourage them to make signs on their own and post them to the event page.  Gather your supplies--you’ll need cardboard, markers or paint, wooden stakes, and cloth for banners.  Plan your slogans before you make the sign.  Use contrasting colors for high visibility, such as black on white or red on yellow.  Make your signs as clear as possible. People who don't know anything about your cause should be able to learn something from your signs.  Be clever. Witty signs have gone viral online, spreading the cause worldwide!, On the morning of the event, check to make sure everything is in order. Make sure the organizing committee and speakers are accounted for, supplies have been delivered and set up, and all your permits are complete and ready to be presented., Make sure your supporters are safe from attack, arrest, and accidents, then take a moment to reflect on the event. You’ve made a difference in your community and brought people together for a common cause. That’s something to be proud of!  ","narrow down your cause. organize a committee. choose picketing for local, very specific protests. organize a vigil to support for a larger cause. choose a sit-in if you have a specific demand that can be met quickly. organize a march for a large group. pick a date and location. make a budget. get permission. find a speaker. talk to your friends. advertise locally. connect to the internet and social media. speak to traditional media. assign tasks to your committee. check for safety issues. make protest signs and banners. do a last-minute check. protest safely!

"If your annuity is not transferable, then you cannot sell it under any circumstances. Check your contract to see if it is transferable. If you are trying to get immediate funds, list your nontransferable annuity as an asset or form of income and apply for a bank loan.;  , Check your contract or consult your accountant to learn about the laws in your state. Most states have laws that protect people trying to sell their structured annuity. If your state has a Structured Settlement Protection Act, your transaction will have to be approved by a state court.The Periodic Payment Settlement Act protects those who received a cash sum as a result of personal injury and wrongful death lawsuits, from spending the awarded money too quickly, which may then force them to turn to public assistance to meet their needs.Don’t try to sell a structured annuity by yourself, especially if you are living in a state that does not have a structured annuity protection law. Talk to a trusted broker and attorney before you proceed.  Before you shop around for annuity buyers, find out what the resale value of your annuity is. Hire an accountant if you are unclear on the details of your investment and its relative worth. Keep in mind that selling your annuity always result in your receiving a lower amount of money from your annuity. You will get a lump-sum payment that is adjusted with a discount rate, meaning that you'll get about 8 to 14 percent less than you would if you waited for the payments., All annuities offer tax-deferral from the time of your initial investment. Your distributions, however, are taxable. This means that your annuity grows tax-free in the accumulation phase, but is taxed as distributions are made to you. These payments are taxed as ordinary income.Gains made by selling your annuity before it matures are taxable as ordinary income. However, losses on the sale are not tax-deductible as investment losses.If you withdraw from an annuity before age 59.5, you are also charged a 10% tax penalty. However, exceptions are made in various cases, such as the death or disability of the annuity holder.  You can also trade your annuity for another qualified annuity contract without paying taxes on the first annuity. These '1035' exchanges can be tricky, so check with a tax accountant or investment adviser before proceeding., Your best source for locating a potential buyers is the insurance agent that first sold you the annuity. They understand the market well and will likely have contacts for this sort of transaction. Additionally, they may also charge you a reduced commission for finding a buyer, as you already paid them a commission when you purchased the annuity.Alternately, you can search for an annuity buyer online. Before working with any of these companies, make sure that they:  Have positive, independent reviews of their services.  Have excellent customer service.  Can make a competitive offer for your annuity.  Are licensed to conduct business and follow all appropriate regulations.  Communicate timelines and figures in a transparent way.  Recommend that you first consult with a financial professional before selling.Try checking with the Better Business Bureau (BBB) to identify whether or not the company is reputable. Companies with poor ratings from the BBB should be avoided.Some reputable buyers of annuities include JG Wentworth, Peachtree Financial, and Stone Street Capital. These companies can be contacted by phone or through their respective websites.  If you are having trouble finding potential buyers, or if you can't find the price you think is reasonable, hire a broker. You’ll have to pay a brokerage fee, but you may stand to gain from the expertise of the broker's negotiations. Choose your broker carefully. Check their certifications to ensure that they are licensed to negotiate the sort of sale you want to make.  Ask the broker you want to hire for a quote. If they quote you a percentage, calculate it before you agree.  Look up the name of a broker you haven't worked with before. Any violations or complaints they have might be online., Try to obtain offers from at least five companies before you choose. When you find companies online, use their quote form to get a free quote from them. A quote is not necessarily the amount you would receive, and it may not include the fee that may be deducted when a settlement is reached.  When you fill out the free quote form, give them only the standard information. Your name, email address and the name of your annuity should be the only information they ask for.  Do not give your social security number, bank information, or pay any fees to obtain a free quote.  Give yourself as much time as you can to make the sale. A rushed sale is less likely to get you a good deal.  Getting an offer of about 80% of the value of your annuity would be considered a good deal.Do not take a deal in which your buyer expects you to pay fees out of pocket before a settlement is agreed upon. Once you have finalized your agreement, all agreed upon court costs, legal fees and commissions should be deducted from the final settlement.  To sell your annuity, you will need copies of your original annuity application and your annuity policy. If you are already collecting on your annuity, you will need your most recent disbursement check and tax return. If you have a settlement agreement, you will need a copy of that. Bring your valid government issued id, such as a passport or driver's license, and a written declaration that you are selling your annuity of your own free will.  Gather any other documentation your buyer requires, such as a copy of a court judgment for a structured annuity, or copies of any release agreements.  Investigate the various ways annuity buyouts are made. Remember that no matter what kind of deal you make, the buyer will get the better deal in the long term. You will likely be offered anywhere from 60% to 85% of the value of your annuity. With this in mind, consider alternatives to selling your annuity.  If you are just selling your annuity to free up some cash, taking out a loan might better serve your purposes.  If you sell as a straight purchase, the buyer will give you one lump-sum payment for your annuity. You will not go on to collect future payments. Choose to sell as a straight purchase if you are trying to get the largest immediate sum possible, or if you have determined that your annuity is not serving its purpose.  If you sell an annuity contract, you will have to pay ordinary income tax on your annuity's earnings., In this case, the buyer purchases your immediate annuity payments for a set period. At the end of that time, you once again collect your annuity payments as scheduled. Consider this option if you have a temporary shortage of cash, but would like to continue investing in your retirement.  Sell several years of your annuity. For example, if you are now receiving $1,000 per month for the next 15 years, sell your payments from years 5 through 10 only. You will get a lump sum for those years, but still receive your current payments up through year 4. You will then receive no monthly payments in years 5 through 10, but they will resume in years 11 through 15.  Know that this will result in a lower overall payout from your annuity. You will get the money for the sold years up front, but it will be lower than the total value of the payments from those years.  You also need to be sure of the value of the future payments before any deals are made.  This might be a good option if you need money now, but know you will be able to support yourself during an upcoming time period.  If your buyer makes a split purchase, they will receive part of your monthly payment. If you only need $500 a month and your annuity payment is $1,000, sell half your annuity; you will get an immediate lump sum for the half you don't need, and continue to receive monthly payments of $500.  Even though you've only sold half the annuity, you will still pay ordinary income taxes on the deferred earnings and any gains made on the sale.  ","determine whether or not your annuity is transferable. determine if your annuity is a structured settlement. evaluate your annuity. understand the tax implications of selling your annuity. search for potential annuity buyers. hire a broker. get offers for your annuity. pick the best offer. gather your paperwork. decide what type of funding you are trying to get from your sale. consider selling as a straight purchase. consider selling as a partial purchase. consider selling as a reverse purchase. consider selling as split purchases.

"Removing meat from your diet can significantly reduce fat, but if you aren’t willing to do that, choose leaner meat. Most store-bought meat will have a label that says the lean percentage. The higher the lean percentage, the less fat there is. If you can’t tell by looking at the label of the meat, don’t be afraid to ask an employee which meats are leanest.  Cooking meat releases most of the fat anyway. Buying lean means you can reduce even more fat overall.  Compare the various packed selections and choose ones that don’t have much fat on them. It will save you time in preparation because you won’t have to cut the fat off yourself. This is especially helpful when buying steaks, roasts, and pork chops, as these tend to have sections of fat left on., Although some fat melts off of the meat when you cook it, the meat still soaks in the fat as it cooks. Use a sharp knife and cut off as much of the fat as you can before you cook the meat. Don’t bother slicing into the red muscle part of the meat, just trim the fat that is around the edges.Remove the skin from poultry before you eat it, as this also contains extra fat.  The muscle itself still contains fat, so some fat will still be in the meat.  If you have time, cook the meat at least a couple of hours before you add it to a dish. Set it in the refrigerator so that the cooked off fat can harden, then scrape the excess fat off and discard it. This works well for large chunks of meat, like a roast, but may not work as well for ground meat., When meat is part of a recipe and not the main dish, reduce fat by using less meat. Even a ¼ or ⅓ less meat in the dish will reduce the overall fat. You can replace the meat and bolster the dish by adding extra vegetables to fill out the quantity of the recipe.  ","choose lean cuts of meat. choose meat with little visible fat. trim the fat off before you cook meat. cook meat ahead of time and scrape off the hardened fat. use less meat than the recipe calls for.

"Ice wine is manufactured across the globe, but Germany and Canada are known for producing the best ice wines. If you’re looking for a traditional ice wine, select a wine from one of these two countries.Canadian and German wines primarily use Riesling grapes in their ice wines.Canadian wines do not age well and are best consumed when they are younger. German wines should be allowed to age a little longer.;  , The United States is not a major producer of ice wines, but it does have several very successful vineyards. If you’re buying ice wine from the US, look for wines manufactured in very cold regions, like Michigan or the Finger Lake region of New York.If you’re an ice wine super-fan or if you’re local to New York, visit the NY State Ice Wine Festival, which is held every February in Fairport, New York. Wineries across the region bring samples for vendors and new fans to sample and enjoy.  There are also other festivals scattered across New York, as well as across the country. Try Googling Ice Wine festivals to find an option near you.  Australia is much warmer than other countries where ice wine is manufactured, and therefore, their methods are a bit more controversial. Australian ice wine is created using artificial freezing techniques, instead of natural freezing techniques.Tasters are unable to tell the difference between wines frozen artificially and wines frozen naturally, but if you're looking for a more traditional ice wine experience, avoid Australian ice wine.

"Lory and lorikeets need a large cage to thrive. The cage you get should be at least two feet tall and 24 by 24 inches., When doing a routine cleaning, check all the toys. If toys have broken edges, loose strings, or other damages, throw them away. Replace them with similar toys right away. Most bird toys are not made to last long term and need to be replaced fairly regularly., To minimize the risk of negative reactions to cleaning products, go for natural products. Most pet stores sell organic cleaners and disinfectants that minimize the use of harsh chemicals and artificial ingredients., Due to the tendency of lories and lorikeets to squirt their droppings, place the cage in an area that is easy to clean. Ideally, keep the cage outdoors. If you don't have space for a safe outdoor aviary, place the cage near washable walls, such as tiled walls or walls painted with acrylic paint.

"The most common test for testosterone involves your physician drawing a tube of blood from your vein. In addition to the blood sample, your physician will also perform a physical exam., Because low testosterone may be an indicator for an underlying problem, like a problem with the pituitary gland, liver disease, an inherited disease, or Addison's disease, your doctor may want to test you for an underlying problem if you have low testosterone. Depending on your physical exam, your symptoms, and your history, other tests may be required after the testosterone test. Your doctor may test for thyroid function, diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease., Testosterone can also be measured in your saliva, though not many mainstream physicians offer this option. The test is reasonably reliable, but it is too new of a method to be totally accepted.Two reputable labs that test for salivary testosterone are ZRTLabs and Labrix.  If your total testosterone from your screening lab test comes back abnormal, ask to have the test for “free” or bioavailable testosterone. The most important testosterone value is the “free” and/or bioavailable testosterone. This is not always measured because it is not so easy to measure.  The tests for “free” or bioavailable testosterone are considered better biomarkers., There are things that might affect the results of your test. Taking medicines with estrogen or testosterone (including birth control), digoxin, spironolactone, and barbiturates may interfere with the test. Medicines for prostate cancer and that raise prolactin levels may also have a negative effect. Hypothyroidism can also interfere with the test., If your testosterone levels are low, talk to your physician about testosterone replacement therapy. Testosterone is available as a gel or patch, muscular injections, or tablets that can be dissolved under the tongue.There are also some natural options including dietary approaches, increased exercise, and herbs such as Tribulus terrestris, Ashwagandha, Ginkgo Biloba, Maca, and Yohimbe.

"Children between the ages of 8 and 18 spend an average of 7.5 hours a day using electronics and media such as TV, cell phones, computers, and video games.The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that kids and teens should use media such as this for 'no more than one or two hours per day.'You can limit tech consumption by establishing a 'curfew' for media devices, such as requiring them to be shut off before bedtime. Setting up scheduled times when your children are allowed to use media and technology, such as a 'video game hour,' will help establish boundaries for proper use.Have a small box or shelf for your child to put his or her cell phone in before they go outside. This will encourage them to be more mindful about where and when they use it, and will make it easier for you to make sure they're actually getting the quality outdoor time they need.;  , You don't have to toss all your tech, but the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that parents create 'screen-free' zones at home by taking actions such as turning off the TV at mealtimes and making sure that children's bedrooms don't have computers, TVs, or video games in them. If your children know there are other options for recreation than media consumption, they will be more likely to take advantage of them.  If you have a backyard, you may need to spruce it up a little to make it fun for your kids to play in. Clear away overgrown brush and any poisonous plants and keep the yard mowed. Things such as swing-sets and sandboxes provide hours of fun.  If you live an urban area or don't have a yard, you still have options. find a safe, pleasant park or playground and make it a habit to take your kids there. You can even search the Internet for recommendations from people in your community. There are also online playground finders.  Studies have show that adults who feel a sense of community with their neighbors are likely to spend more time outdoors for recreation and exercise, and this carries over to their children too. Parents who know their neighbors are also more likely to feel safe letting their children play outdoors.Getting to know your neighborhood can be particularly helpful if you don't have a suitable play area for your kids at your own home. In addition to the health benefits of outdoor play, allowing your kids to play at their friends' houses promotes social skills development, helps them learn teamwork, and relieves stress.

"While in high school, you still might not know what you want to do as a career. However, if you think you may want to become an educational diagnostician, there are things you can do to gain experience and see if this might be a good fit for you.  Volunteer at an organization for people with special needs.  Teach or tutor younger kids to see if you enjoy working one on one with young people.  Educational diagnosticians work individually with students to diagnose learning differences and disabilities. It's their job to help figure out what a student needs to be able to learn and thrive in a school setting.;  , You can get your bachelor’s degree in education or in a variety of other subjects before deciding to become an educational diagnostician. Bachelor’s degrees generally take about four years to complete when done through a full-time program.Having a specialization in special education is considered highly advantageous when applying for jobs or graduate school. To do this, you'll need to take specific classes within your major and talk to your advisor about what's required to fulfill the specialization.If you work full-time or don’t have time for a full-time course load, you can take as much time as you need to complete your bachelor’s degree.  The National Clearinghouse for Professionals in Special Education highly recommends that students looking to become educational diagnosticians boost their credentials by doing volunteer work with people with disabilities. Some of the groups they recommend working with are:The Association of Retarded Citizens  The National Easter Seal Society  The Special Olympics.  In order to even begin training to be an educational diagnostician, you need to have at least two years of teaching experience. This is important, as it gives you the experience you’ll need to be a competent diagnostician, and it will show you if this career path is right for you.In order to become a teacher, you need to pass a certification test and pass national background checks.  Certification requirements for teachers vary by state. Check your state’s certification requirements on the school board’s official website.  This is the master’s degree that you’ll need in order to pursue a certificate and career as a diagnostician. Some universities will let you complete your master’s degree and your bachelor’s degree in a combined program, which can make the entire course of study shorter and more direct.If you have already begun teaching through a certificate program, you may be too busy for a traditional master’s program. Many online programs will be able to accommodate your busy schedule.  If you have a master’s degree in another field, you may be able to get a certificate rather than having to get an entirely different master’s degree.  Within the master’s program that you enroll in, you can pursue an Educational Diagnostician certification track. This will require you to take courses such as Educating Students with Emotional/Behavioral Disorders, Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports in Schools, Assessment and Evaluation of Students with Disabilities, Psychoeducational Assessment, Assessment and Evaluation of Students with Disabilities.If you have a master’s of education in another track, or a master’s degree in another discipline, you can potentially apply for certification through a graduate program. This generally means meeting with your advisor to come up with a list of courses you’ll take in order to make up for any deficiencies in your education up to this point.  There is considerable job growth in this field, which means that prospects for finding a job are good. You need to know what to look for in job postings and apply to any jobs that look like they might be right for you.Boost your chances of finding a job by emphasizing your relevant experience on your resume.  The more experience you’ve had teaching and working in the field, the better your resume looks.  If you don’t see job openings where you live, you may need to consider looking for work elsewhere to stay working in the field.

"As soon as the seasonal flu vaccine is made available, you should visit your doctor and get vaccinated. By being vaccinated, you’ll protect yourself from being infected. As a result, your chance of infecting your infant will be much lower. Without a flu vaccine, you and your family will be much more vulnerable.Everyone who lives in your home should be vaccinated.  Anyone who encounters your infant, such as extended family, should be vaccinated.;  , Typically, infants 6 months or older can get a flu vaccine. Getting the flu vaccine may dramatically lower their risk of catching the flu. However, infants younger than 6 months cannot get a vaccine.  Talk to your doctor about whether a vaccine is appropriate for your child., Breastfeeding helps transfer a mother’s immunities to her baby. As a result, breastfeeding can potentially bolster your infant’s immune system so they can better resist or fight off the flu.If you can’t breastfeed, talk to your child’s pediatrician about steps you can take to build your child’s immunity to things like the flu virus.  While you should always provide your baby with proper nutrition, it is even more important during flu season. Good nutrition will bolster your infant’s immune system. In the end, they’ll be able to resist or fight off the flu a lot more effectively., Hand sanitizer is one of the most effective weapons in killing germs before they cause sickness. As a result, you should carry and use alcohol-based hand sanitizer everywhere you go during flu season. This is important, as flu germs could live for hours on inanimate objects. By sanitizing your hands and objects you use often – like your phone or car keys – you’ll help protect your baby from the flu., As a rule, most babies should stay out of the public for their first two months of life. This should be extended when it comes to flu season. During flu season, the more your baby is at home, the lower their chance of catching the flu.  Stay away from places with lots of people like the mall, grocery stores, or entertainment venues.Keep your child home from daycare if a lot of children in your area have the flu.

"It is important to note that these alternative remedies are not backed by scientific evidence — evidence that they work is anecdotal, or based on personal experience and word of mouth. Without scientific studies to prove they are effective, there is no way to know if alternative treatments are helpful at all in treating pinworm.  If you want to try an alternative method, talk to your doctor first. These alternative methods should still be undertaken in combination with medication from your doctor, and should not considered to be medical therapies by themselves.  Garlic is thought to be a good home remedy to help get rid of pinworms.First, eat lots of fresh garlic. The garlic may help reduce and kill the pinworms when you have a bowel movement. You can also make a garlic paste to apply around the anal area. The garlic may kill the eggs and the oil will help soothe the itching.  To make the paste, crush two to three cloves of fresh garlic. Add a few teaspoons of castor oil or mineral oil. Make sure you add enough to get a paste-like consistency. You can also make a paste by adding garlic to petroleum jelly.  Make sure to discuss home remedies with your doctor before using them.  Turmeric has been shown in lab studies to kill parasites, though researchers are unsure if it kills parasites in humans; however, spicy foods, such as turmeric, are thought to be an effective cure against pinworms. Take 300 mg of turmeric in the form of a capsule three times a day.You may also consider making a tea with turmeric. Steep one teaspoon of turmeric in one cup of hot water for five to 10 minutes. Drink two to four cups.  Don't take turmeric if you use blood thinners because it increases the risk of bleeding.  The wormwood herb has been traditionally used to help expel worms from the digestive tract. Add a three to four drops of wormwood tincture to a cup of warm water. Have your child drink one cup a day. Adults can drink two cups a day.  Talk to your doctor before using wormwood.  Don't take wormwood if you take anti-seizure medication. If you are allergic to ragweed, you may also be allergic to wormwood.  ","understand the limitations of natural remedies. use garlic. try turmeric. drink wormwood tea. "
"Cranberry juice has been touted as useful for urinary tract problems, but in some cases it can be an irritant instead of a help. Water is best. Three to four quarts a day is how much you should aim for.;  , Cranberry extract or pure cranberry juice is also useful, however cranberry can aggravate the condition in certain cases. Drinking apple cider vinegar is also a good preventative measure.  The dose is variable. Some people can only tolerate 500mg a day, others take 4 to 5 grams without problem; check with your doctor first but a good dose is around a gram a day. This helps keep urine acid and prevent growth of organisms.  The sudsy water helps break down the protective mucus at the opening of your urethra and allows germs to get in.  For females: after intercourse, get up and urinate as soon as you reasonably can. Urinating rinses away any germs which may have gotten to the urethra.  They provide a moist trail right from your anus to the urethra and those E. coli travel right to it. Instead, wear cotton underpants or at least cotton crotch panties. Cotton allows moisture to evaporate and prevents having a perfect environment for growth of organisms.  After using the toilet, be sure to wipe from front to back, so as not to drag germs from the anal area to your urethra.  ","drink lots of water. drinking citrus soda to help prevent kidney infection is also useful - often kidney infections can lead from bladder infections. take vitamin c daily. avoid taking bubble baths. urinate. avoid wearing thongs. wipe the right way.

"Before the school year starts, you will want to meet with the teacher about what they expect of you. Depending on the teacher’s style, they may heavily rely on you to organize classroom parties and events. Others may have a particular way of doing things and only ask you to do certain things. Either way, you will want to respect the teacher’s style and work with them to create their vision for the class.If the teacher is not too busy, consider meeting for coffee to discuss the coming school year.  Consider contacting the teacher well in advance of the start of the school year. Many teachers have in-services and other administrative duties in the weeks immediately before the start of school.  Be sure to ask the teacher things like “what’s the best way to stay in touch, and how often should we communicate?” and “what are the classes snack rules?”;  , Once you have met with the teacher and determined their expectations, you will want to introduce yourself to the other parents in a letter or email. Let them know that you will be helping the teacher organize certain events. You will also want to mention that you will be recruiting volunteers throughout the year and that parents should be prepared to help out.This initial letter is also a good time to share your contact information and request that parents send you there’s. Although email is the preferred method of communication, a phone number may also be useful. People are sometimes bad about checking their inboxes regularly.  As a room parent, you will need to solicit and organize classroom donations from other parents. You will need to find volunteers to donate goods (paper products, snacks, decorations) or money for classroom events. To facilitate this, you can set up a volunteer list or a donation fund at the beginning of the year. You may also find that it is easier to contact people as you need volunteers and donations.Talk with the teacher at the beginning of the year to find out what they need from parents. You may also want to determine what the school’s policies are on outside snacks.  You may also want to start a small donation fund to buy the teacher a gift at some point.  One of your primary duties as a room parent is to facilitate communication among the parents, as well as between the parents and the teacher. You should get an up-to-date list of emails from the teacher that you can use to keep parents in the loop on upcoming events and ask for volunteers and donations. If the teacher does not have a list, you should contact the parents about their preferred mode of communication.You might consider organizing a coffee or playground meeting to help the parents meet in person.  You may also want to create a classroom site or folder using Shutterfly, Google Drive, or another service to share all important classroom information in one place.  ","meet with the teacher. write a welcome letter at the beginning of the year. ask for donations. maintain communication. "
"The most effective way to test for CO2 is to bubble the gas through 'lime water', a diluted solution of calcium hydroxide (slaked lime). When you bubble carbon dioxide through the solution, it forms a solid precipitate of calcium carbonate – chalk or limestone. Calcium carbonate is insoluble in water.Thus, if there is CO2 present in the sample, the limewater will turn milky, cloudy white., The process is simple: dilute calcium hydroxide with water. Calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) is a colorless white powder that you can buy from most chemistry suppliers. Pure limewater, once mixed, is clear and colorless, with a slight earthy smell and the bitter, alkaline taste of calcium hydroxide. Follow these steps to make your own limewater:  Put 1 teaspoon of calcium hydroxide into a clean one-gallon (or smaller) glass jar. Limewater is a saturated solution, which means there will be some extra chemical that doesn't dissolve. A teaspoon will result in a fully saturated solution, whether you use a gallon jar or a smaller container.Fill the jar with distilled water or tap water. Distilled water will always give you a purer solution, but the minerals present in tap water should not hinder your test.  Put a lid on the jar. Shake the solution vigorously for 1-2 minutes, then let it stand for 24 hours.  Pour the clearer solution off the top of the jar through a clean coffee filter or filter paper. Be very careful not to stir up the sediment. If necessary, repeat this filtering step until you obtain a clear limewater solution. Store in a clean jar or bottle.  Half-fill a test tube with limewater – then boil it. Use a delivery tube to pipe the contents of the CO2 sample test tube directly into the boiling limewater. You can use a flexible pipe or a (metal) straw as a delivery tube, if nothing better is around. Let the captured gas 'bubble' through the liquid, and wait for the reaction to take place.  If you don't want to boil anything, you can use a gas syringe to discharge the CO2 gas directly into the half-filled limewater test tube. Stopper the test tube, then shake vigorously for 1-2 minutes. If there is carbon dioxide in the sample, then the solution should grow cloudy., If CO2 is present, the lime water will turn milky white with calcium carbonate particulates. If the limewater is boiling, and the gas is piped directly into the limewater, then the reaction should begin immediately. If nothing happens after a minute or so, you can safely assume that there is no carbon dioxide in your sample., Understand what exactly is taking place to indicate the presence of CO2. The equation for the test is: Ca(OH)2 (aq) + CO2 (g) -> CaCO3 (s) + H2O (l). In non-chemistry language: liquid limewater + gas (which contains CO2) react to solid lime (the particles) and liquid water.  ","bubble the gas through limewater. make a limewater solution. bubble the gas through the limewater. look for cloudy water. know the chemical reaction. "

"If you have the right hardware, you may be able to squeeze more power out of it by increasing the clock speed and voltage. This is referred to as 'overclocking,' and is not without risk. Increasing the voltage too much can fry your equipment, but if you can get more power out of your hardware you can see significant performance boosts. Heavy overclocking will require more advanced cooling techniques. Not all hardware can be overclocked.See Overclock a Graphics Card for instructions on overclocking your video card.  See Overclock a CPU for instructions on overclocking your CPU.  There are several programs available that are designed to boost performance while playing games. These optimizers will suspend non-essential background processes, defrag your game folders, and perform other optimizations. Your mileage may vary with these, especially if you've already taken the time to close background programs and regularly maintain your hard drive. Popular boosting programs include:Razer Cortex  Game Gain  , If you haven't upgraded your computer in a while, a few upgrades can go a long way towards increasing game performance.:  RAM - Most games released these days require 4 GB of RAM at minimum, with 8 GB being recommended in most cases. RAM is pretty cheap, and installing it is easier than you may think. See Install RAM for instructions.  Video Card - One of the best ways to improve your video games' performance is by upgrading your video card. These can get a little expensive, but even a mid-range card can provide a significant performance boost if you haven't upgraded in a while. See Install a Graphics Card for instructions.  CPU - Your CPU is less important to gaming than it used to be, but if you're running a really old computer you may want to upgrade to a quad-core processor.

"Understand that 'Har Megiddo' may be translated 'Mountain of the Gathering,' (with some revealing overtones of 'uncertain,' if you dig further into 'Har' ), and is not a place, as can be noted in the first lexicon reference, 'Har-Magedon, a mountain of unc. location,' where 'unc' means 'uncertain.' Or rather, it is a place, but is given to be interpreted spiritually; it is a spiritual place, the same way that heaven is a spiritual place--or state of being--meaning that there is no 'place' called heaven, which the Bible is very clear about (Luke 17:20 {et al} “The kingdom of God is not coming with something observable; 21no one will say, ‘Look here! ’ or ‘There! ’ For you see, the kingdom of God is among you.”  Now Megiddo is a real place, , so we'll include the lexicon for it, mostly because you might wish to dig into 'gadad,' from which Megiddo is derived, mostly because it includes some interesting overtones of self-immolation, or 'you brought this upon yourself,' pretty much exactly like a father responding to one of their children in the situations that we all experience. So, if you can accept that Jerusalem is the spiritual center, the lexicon informs us that Megiddo was an ancient fortress town, even before David and Solomon.  While the literal stuff of your nightmares may surely come true, to God Armageddon is just the human struggle between the spiritual center, where He balances His 'foot,' and the forces of the earthly king that God warned us we would be sorry about in 1 Samuel 8. The 'waters' or 'sea' in the Bible represents 'people', and 'mountain' (usually reserved for God) here represents the place that the people who have 'risen up' from the 'waters' (or those seeking God) gather; which is why it is occurring right at the edge of the spiritual center of the universe in The Revelation.  Thus, 'Then they gathered the kings together to the place that in Hebrew is called Armageddon' in Rev 16:16, can easily be interpreted as 'Then they (the evil spirits) gathered the kings (the people running things) together to the place that is known as the king's fortress--just north of where the 'soldiers' {of God} gather, a spiritual place, derived from the lexicon. For lack of a handier Christian metaphor, The Mahatma's famous quote, “First they ignore you, then they ridicule you, then they fight you, and then you win” may be one perfectly valid reflection of Armageddon, in the context of 'The Revelation of Christ,' whereas the more literal popular alternative suggests followers of Christ gathering for a violent confrontation, and killing or being killed.  Yes, the blood will flow up to a horse's bridle; signifying the blood of all who died, and likely not just those killed in one epic literal battle.;  , It is a spiritual war for the center (but as a corollary, the culturally accepted definition, or scenario, has happened in the past, at Har Megiddo {we're talking about the plains of Megiddo, now}; strange and terrible wars they would be to us, and not easily comprehended; Genesis 1:2 'The earth was formless and void' is better interpreted 'the earth became void, unless we are to believe that God creates void, formlessness, and chaos.  A lexicon of this verse, at the word 'was,' illuminates this concept, down at 'was, hayah (haw-yaw), to exist, i.e. be or become, come to pass (always emphatic, and not a mere copula or auxiliary)--where we accept 'exist' or 'be,' while 'become' or 'come to pass' is surely the correct interpretation, and also by following 'tohu' at the top, clicking on '8414' yields 'chaos (1), confusion (1), desolation (1), emptiness (1), empty space (1), formless (2), futile (2), futile things (1), meaningless (2), meaningless arguments (1), nothing (2), waste (3), waste place (2), as well as following 'vavohu, 924,' so the common interpretation suggests that God made 'confusion, chaos' etc, which is anathema to God of course. But the point is that there were all kinds of things, giants, etc, present at one time, that seem like fiction to us now.  The war is always at the center of a thing--you don't plot to overturn by raiding an outpost. And furthermore, there is no struggle where God or heaven is concerned. The fight is in you, for the earth. Although the fight spills into the physical plane, it is not a physical fight. There were wars even before man arrived on the scene, in other 'centers,' and not for just the earth; but they do not concern us now.  What is important now is that those 'angels of death' have always been, and will always be, as long as there is 'free will'; they aren't some satanic horde, except that which is released by man. If you are even reading this, you must care somewhat about discernment; and are surely aware that satan has no power, but what we give him.The Four Horsemen is us ('4' being the cardinal Directions away from Center),as far from our center as we can get. Think Avarice, Greed, Vanity, etc., and recognize that we are all in this together, regardless of any personal desire to the contrary. In other words, it is easy to personally justify how disconnected from evil you think you are, yet still be in complete slavery to the worldly system. You use petro-dollars, right? Yet tares grow with wheat. It rains on the evil and the good.  As a connected aside, this speaks to what is meant in the Bible by 'witnessing' -- you are called out of 'the world' (ego, materialism), while still being an example for the world. 'Witnessing' is misinterpreted by many Christians to mean that they are to ask people 'Do you know Jesus Christ as your Personal Lord and Savior?'. Recognize that Jesus never cornered anyone in this manner. The Bible admonishes those who would have their 'ship' in a 'safe harbor.' Proselytizing may be viewed as a sanctimonious and self-serving way to justify fence-sitting, while keeping your ship in harbor.'...let us not love in word or in tongue, but in deed and in truth.' IJohn3:18  While this is usually done in innocence and caring, it is an affront; you are literally doing 'satan's' work by using a false representation of Christ to chase people from the coming, new Government (Isa 9:6), especially if you believe that everyone who does not believe exactly like you do is 'lost.' Understand that God is about spiritual 'substance', or what is 'central' to you, and it is irrelevant if you call yourself an atheist even, if you then go out and manifest Christ to people. The Parable of the Two Sons reflects this spiritual principle; don't let some guy with a tie tell you it is only about Jews and Gentiles. Read and decide for yourself.  Except possibly in a very limited sense. The Bible even says 'no one knows where they go when they die.' You don't know where you came, from, or where you are going, and any explanation will amount to words. If either were explained to you, you wouldn't, couldn't fully comprehend; as evidenced by the fact that you would like it explained; and you would cherish a concise explanation above everything you own, probably.  And, there is a Book for this, which can be frustrating to read, because you are looking for proof or facts, while It is full of (apparent) contradictions and questions, and Strong Men have interpreted It for the weaker in such a way that you do not accept, but cannot prove wrong, just as they can not prove that 'Love your neighbor; this fulfills the law' is all one needs for salvation, the point being that no matter where you come down where Scripture is concerned, you have revealed your heart, which is all God cares about.  Of course, being that man was involved, there was a humongous battle for the Book. The battle for the Book continues to this day, and again, it is your battle to fight, to lose or to win. You have a lexicon available to you, and no new translation can obscure it.  Every possible faction that has a part in the battle for the earth, has an agenda for you in the fight; but, although the battle is for the earth, it has to be fought with the Book. This is because the Book is Truth, and Truth is your only weapon.  Note that you can overcome, and participate in the Kingdom of God without ever reading a Bible; but you are still going to use the principles in It. Truth is also clearly reflected in other books, but this just clouds the issue here. When It was completed, when part II came out, It was locked away for hundreds and hundreds of years, by men, and no one could read It (and they didn't read It, either, of course--they hated It); they would kill you if you did manage to read It, or even if you got caught owning One, these men, and others after them.  And that battle still rages today; now It is no longer kept from you physically, there is no need; It is being kept from you spiritually.  This was all done in the Name, of course, by people who were convinced that they were doing the Right Thing, the Bible calls them 'strongmen.'  Not being able (or, willing) to see the center of something is the same as not knowing it. You can't see the wind, or the 'ether' (nothing), from where everything comes; we don't know what probably 90% of the species on the planet are, right now, or that 'the earth' includes all that out there, everything that is physical. To finish, you don't even know where elephants are buried (edit: elephants no longer bury their dead; 40 years ago, this was a mystery, but we've solved it by slaughtering almost all of them); and we probably don't know what Armageddon is, either.  Even one hundred years ago, although we dimly understood the thing 'vacuum', no scientist on earth could prove how a rocket firing in it would act, or react. There is a point, here, which is to show you, briefly, how much of even the physical plane we, as humans, are 'unaware' of. Physicists can't find something like 95% of the matter that they know must exist. You are thus hardly compelled to accept the groupthink--or this interpretation, for that matter--where Armageddon is concerned.  The only thing you can really be certain of is that whatever the herd thinks about a Biblical thing, that is exactly what is not going to happen, by definition. The Bible says that 'even the elect would be deceived, if that were possible,' and religious people ('Pharisees,' then) are deemed 'the blind leading the blind.' There is no reason to suspect that today's religious hierarchy are anything other than today's 'Pharisees.'  , It displaces your center in time, toward some imaginary future date...game over! At least until another artifice is needed. Meaning that if you are all plexed up about some coming Apocalypse, you are effectively removed from manifesting Christ.  Just like in the war for the Book, the concept of Armageddon was given to you. There is a description of some of the action, sure; and 'physical' battles seem to be, and will be, fought. However, Armageddon, for you, will end when you die; your battle is complete, vanquished or Victor.  God does not need to send physical armies for the battle for the earth. Because He could wipe it all off with His foot, and start over, except He can't because He gave it to us. Then we gave it away, too, and, left to our own devices, we wouldn't ever get it back, because look we can't even figure out where elephants are buried. And it's real important that we get it back, too, because the earth is where we go; it is our realm, and we have nowhere else to go.  If you were raised on the belief that you could 'get saved', get 'baptized' (by water), then chill 'til you die, and go to Heaven, read this, it's in there somewhere, or even in a Bible, all over the place -- the end of Pr 2, for a start; Is 9:6, all over -- the Bible states explicitly, many times, that the earth is man's realm, and that the Kingdom of God is coming here. You even say it in your prayers; 'on earth as it is in Heaven.'  Luckily for us, despite free will, we have a way to give God permission to act in our realm; prayer. Prayer is the way you make it ok for God to do something in our realm; otherwise, He pretty much won't. We call this 'religious', but religion is another thing that we have differing definitions of; among ourselves, and between us and God -- and 'religious' prayers are admonished in the Bible -- they are deemed pointless, and not listened to by God.  Religion is just another distraction. 'Man's attempt to reach God' is the accepted definition. There you go. It is likely just the other side of the coin of politics, and you can't have one without the other; but don't let that convince you that God is religious, just go and read what Christ had to say about religion.  Funny thing about the Church, though, is you know exactly what it is, or you...sense it; intimate knowledge of it is inside you, you were born with it, and it cannot be removed; although it can be ignored, despised, refuted, denied. It has nothing to do with religion; It is a collection of 'living stones.'  Despite all your concepts about the Church, which were passed down, 'given' to you; despite the desperate attempt to portray the New Government (Is 9:6) as Religion, Usurper, Oppressor, Whore, or Thief; and despite all the war, and the battles for the Book, you know what the Church is. This is because it is your center; it is that vision, that we all had (or have); that you knew intimately when you were a small child, before what you were 'given' removed it to fable.  A great description for Heaven may just be 'What you thought life would be like when you were a little kid'  'I AM' is right next to you, right now, to choose, and does not require anything that you don't have with you, right now. Oh, and you can only, ever choose it right now, because that's all you'll ever have; that's why it's 'I AM', and not 'I will be', or 'I was'. 'Understand I AM' means you should understand the concept of I AM, the 'am' being made emphatic here, not titular, else 'Am' would do fine.  This 'mark,' surely not a physical mark, is placed either on one's 'hand,' which is what we use to do everything with; or on one's 'forehead,' which is where we get the idea to do those things ('forehead,' specifically, is the seat of our self cognizance, but that is another monologue). And so, '...received the mark of the beast in their hand or forehead' may be interpreted 'predisposed to evil in everything they think, and everything they do.' And truly, cannot conduct business, or 'buying and selling,' without this mark; in other words, if you try to make something as well as you are able, and retail it, you are not going to be in business long--you 'must' be a slave to profit in order to conduct business.  ","know that har megiddo is a spiritual war, for the center.it is a battle for the center of you. see that armageddon is not necessarily going to ever come in the sense that you comprehend it, almost certainly probably. recognize that you cannot see the past, or know the future. witness that people have been looking for 'armageddon' since the moment christ began his ministry. realize that your definition of armageddon is so untrue, it is a distraction for you. know the mark of the beast.

"Business is a game of carefully calculated risk-taking. If you can't handle the pressure of making crucial decisions that could potentially sink your business on a daily basis, you're not ready for the business world. Approach each decision by assessing what the worst-case outcome of that decision would be. In other words, what's the worst that could happen? Use that knowledge to make decisions by weighing risk and potential reward. Keep in mind that you can learn from your mistakes and use what you learn from them to succeed later on.Another key aspect of getting into the right mindset is recognizing that there is a lot that you don't know. You should always be open to learning new ideas and incorporating them into your business practices.;  , Your business won't make any money if you're constantly taking out your earnings and spending them. Actually, your business may not make any money at all for a considerable period of time. That is why you have to stay focused and keep working to implement your business plan. Keep on making and achieving those short term goals until it clicks and your momentum drives your business to success.Once you have started making money, continue to live as if you still aren't making it. Any money that you can reinvest into the business will only help it to grow and increase your potential future income streams., Read magazine and newspaper articles that relate to your business interests or business. Follow famous leaders or innovators related to your industry on social media and stay up to date on their thoughts and actions. Attend seminars, join trade associations, and subscribe to publications. Read every relevant book that you can find. Only by learning and staying up to date can you learn where the market is going next and how to innovate past it., Divide your list into short term and long term goals. The short term goals should be a path to achieving the long term goals. For example, for the long term goal of the starting the business you write down short term goals like gain financing and write a business plan. You could then break these short term goals down even further into actionable steps.  Writing down goals and actions to complete will also help you keep your business organized later on. You don't want to forget some crucial action that must be taken simply because you weren't organized enough to remember it., The idea for a business can come from a variety of sources. Perhaps you've noticed a problem in your life or the life of someone close to you that lacks a solution. Or maybe the industry that you've worked in for years is in need of a shakeup. Alternately, maybe you're just looking for a business idea that you can sell to customers and make profitable. Brainstorm ideas for days or weeks and come up with a list of reasonable ideas. When you have a list, consider, for each business idea:  Who are your potential customers?  How would you set up the business model?  Where are you going to get your supplies/materials from?  Do you know enough about this industry to make it work?, No business, especially a small one, can appeal to all customers. In fact, a business is usually defined by the customers or markets they choose not to serve. To become successful, you'll have to identify the niche in the market where your audience is. Start by thinking of what type of customers you want to serve. Are they individuals or businesses? Then, look at the problem your business is solving from their perspective. What type of solutions do they want and how should it be done? Then, you can work within this niche to sell to your customers. Just make sure that your niche is substantial enough to sustain your growth., The first step to actually starting a business is to write a business plan for it. This will give you a basic structure that you can use to plan your goals and decisions. Keep in mind that this plan can be edited over time as you learn new strategies and adapt to your market.  At minimum, a business plan should include a summary of the plan, a business description, market strategies, an analysis of competition, a growth plan, operation and management plans, and how financing will be acquired.See how to write a business plan for more information.  A break-even analysis tells you, quite simply, how long your business will have to be running to turn a profit. This is a helpful tool for understanding how much money you will need to invest before the business even has potential to see a return. This can help you plan for financing and create a timeline for repaying any debt that you may take on when starting the business.If your business plan doesn't break even soon enough, consider reducing expenses by working from home, using less expensive materials, or reducing your number of employees. Alternately, you can increase your product's price., Successful entrepreneurs surround themselves with other successful people. They tend to feed off of their associates' energy and success to enhance their own. Make everyone you spend time with other successful, positive people. Make sure to avoid negative people or those who are chronically unsuccessful., Be on the lookout for industry events in your area or major ones that you can plan to travel to. This may include annual conventions or meet ups organized on social media. By attending these events, you will be able to increase awareness of your business, make new connections, initiate new deals, meet potential new hires, and learn about current events in your field., Constantly explain your business to people you meet and ask them about theirs. Then, ask them how you can send customers over to their business. This creates a more powerful connection with the other business owner that you can hopefully one day convert into additional growth for your own business. That said, you should not expect anything in return from these people., Some of your connections may not immediately, or ever, turn into business expansion opportunities. However, it is important to maintain all relationships. Opportunities can come from unexpected places, so you need to be ready when they do. Keep in touch will all contacts on a regular basis, either through emails, phone calls, or social media.

"Do not rely on articles or videos online to teach you how to administer insulin, whether it's via a syringe, inhaler, or another device. Your doctor can answer any questions and show you the correct way to use your device (for instance, with shots she will need to show you at which angle you should insert the needle). Your doctor will also give you your exact dosage and all the necessary prescriptions.  Seek medical attention immediately if you experience an allergic reaction.  Some insulins are derived from animal sources, most commonly pork, and may cause allergic reactions in people that have severe allergies.Common allergic reactions to insulin include local and systemic reactions. Local reactions occur as redness, minor swelling, and itching at the injection site. This type of skin reaction resolves in a few days to weeks.Systemic allergic reactions can present as a rash or hives that covers large portions of the body, difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, wheezing, decreased blood pressure, increased heart rate, and sweating.This is a medical emergency and you should call 911 or have someone take you to the emergency room if it is close by.  Hypoglycemia occurs when your blood sugar level is too low.Insulin will make hypoglycemia worse; instead, you will need to consumer quick-acting carbohydrates or simple sugars.  Low blood sugar interferes with your brain’s ability to function properly.  Symptoms of hypoglycemia can include dizziness, trembling, headache, blurred vision, having trouble concentrating, confusion, and sometimes trouble with speaking. Other symptoms can include tremor, heavy sweating, increased heart rate, feeling anxious, and hunger.</ref>  Using fast-acting insulin in the midst of a hypoglycemic event will quickly drop your blood sugar even further and result in severe confusion, inability to communicate, and loss of consciousness.If you mistakenly administer insulin when you are having a hypoglycemic event, quickly alert friends or family to seek medical attention, or call 911 if you are alone. Severe hypoglycemia events are serious and life-threatening situations.You can begin to reverse the reaction by drinking orange juice, taking prepared glucose tablets or gel, or quickly begin to consume some form of sugar., Lipodystrophy is a reaction that sometimes occurs on the skin where frequent insulin injections are given.Symptoms of lipodystrophy include changes in the fatty tissues just under the surface of the skin. Unwanted changes that indicate lipodystrophy include both thickening and thinning of the fatty tissue in the injection site areas.Check your skin regularly for lipodystrophy as well as inflammation, swelling, or any signs of infection., Never put syringes or needles in the regular trash.Sharps, including used needles, lancets, and syringes, are considered to be biohazardous waste since they came in direct contact with someone's skin or blood.Always dispose of needles that are used or damaged in a sharps container. Sharps containers are designed to be a safe way to dispose of syringes and needles.Sharps containers are available for purchase at your local pharmacy, or online.Review your state’s biohazardous waste guidelines. Many states have specific recommendations and programs that can help you develop a regular system for disposing of biohazardous waste.Work with a mail back kit. Some companies offer to supply you with the appropriate sizes of sharps containers, and agree to set up an arrangement for you to safely mail those containers back to them when they are full. The company will dispose of the biohazard materials appropriately, according to EPA, FDA, and state requirements., Once the injection has been given, discard the needle and syringe in a sharps container. When an insulin pen is empty, discard the device in the sharps container.  A needle that has pierced your skin, or the skin of someone else, is not only dulled, but contaminated with possibly serious and contagious diseases.  Some insulin products are very similar but not exact. Talk to your doctor before you make any changes in your insulin regimen, including switching brands.Even though some brands are similar, your doctor has chosen the brand that best suits your needs, and your dose has been adjusted to the way that product reacts in your body.Use the same brand of syringes and needles. It is easy to become confused and administer the wrong amount if the syringes and needles look different.  Check the expiration date on your insulin product often. Avoid using insulin that has passed its expiration date.While the potency may be close to the potency when purchased, there is a risk that you will not get enough from using products that have expired, contaminants may be present, or particles may have formed inside the vial., Once the first dose has been used from an insulin product, it is considered open.This includes insulin that has been properly stored in the refrigerator or at room temperature. Since the top of the insulin vial has been punctured, there is an increased risk of contaminants inside the vial, even if you have stored it properly., Be familiar with the brand of insulin you use, your dose, and the brand of additional supplies you use.Be sure you consistently use the same size insulin syringes and needles that were prescribed for you.Using a U-100 syringe in place of a U-500 syringe can be extremely dangerous, and vice versa.  Talk to your doctor or diabetic healthcare provider if you notice any changes in your products or have any questions.  ","ask your doctor for a demonstration. avoid using any insulin product if you are allergic. do not administer insulin if you are having a hypoglycemic event. monitor your skin for lipodystrophy. discard used needles properly. never re-use or share a needle. do not change insulin brands. never use insulin that has expired. discard insulin that has been open for 28 days. know your products and your dose.

"You had a fight with a friend and you're supposed to be upset. Try to calm down for the moment and go where you feel safe. Think about what happened.;  , Make sure this person is someone you trust, a parent maybe? Talking about it helps because you can see the problem from different perspectives and sometimes think of a solution.  Nothing special, just something else to think about. A little pleasant thing will make you feel better.  Because your angry with him or her don't be mean about it. Going around and uncovering your ex-friends secrets or gossiping will not make you feel good, just bitter. Isn't it better to play it cool?  , If you meet with them by accident, don't try to pick a fight or respond to any. Fights get nasty. Nobody needs that.  When you feel like you have, think about the things that passed after. Do you want to make up and be friends again? Or do you want to forget and move on?  , Don't be pushy or dramatic. When the time is right make a joke or laugh together. Apologize if you've done something wrong, but don't make any promises. Step by step will make things back as they were.  It's easier if your friends are on the same page as you. If not, be good to him or her but be careful to remain acquaintances.  If he or she doesn't want to be your friend again, don't let it hit you too hard. Things happen, and people change. It's nobody's fault.

"Sometimes, doing good for others can be hard to do in the spur of the moment. You can create a bucket of ideas to draw from whenever you and your children want to spread joy and positivity.  This bucket might include a range of options such as donating to specific charities, offering a cash gift to a church or hospital, offering free services to families in need such as housecleaning or babysitting, or reading a book to children at the local library.  Go through your child’s old books and toys and take out any that they don’t use anymore. Donate these items to a local children’s hospital or a book or toy drive. Also, donate any pet supplies you don’t use anymore to a shelter, or put money into a Salvation Army bucket.  Have your child choose the items and drop them off with you. Having them involved can help them feel a sense of pride about what they are doing. They can also see where the items are going and how they can help, which may make parting with the donations easier, if they find it difficult., Those who live in retirement homes or communities are often lonely, especially around the holidays. Brighten up someone’s day by taking your child to visit with them. The simple act of having a conversation with a child is enough to elevate a senior’s mood and make the last years of their life more pleasant when it is done often.  Call the retirement home you plan to visit and ask if they accept visitors, as some have strict rules regarding who comes into their facilities. You may also be able to volunteer by reading a book, helping to deliver meals, or just stopping through and saying hi on a regular basis., Volunteering shows your kids that doing things for others, even when you aren’t getting paid for doing so, is extremely rewarding. Ask your child what they would be interested in, whether it’s helping to build homes, working at a soup kitchen, or helping to take care of pets at an animal shelter. Performing these acts of kindness that are related to something your child is interested in will make the experience that much more enjoyable.  Call the charity you are interested in about the age requirements for volunteers. Some non-profits have age restrictions on their volunteers, and some only seek the help of adults. Calling ahead of time can prevent your child from feeling disappointed if they are excited about volunteering and then learn they can’t.  ","create a 'random bucket.', donate to a charity or organization. visit a retirement home. volunteer at a local non-profit organization. "
"For some reason, lots of people think bringing a to-go cup of coffee to a job interview is a great idea. To an interviewer, this looks informal at best and disrespectful at worst. You're not on your lunch break, so treat yourself to a latte after the interview, not before. Even if the interview is early, or you might end up waiting a long time to get through with it, don't show up with a cup of coffee. The plus side is you won't have to worry about spilling it.  Biggest faux-pas of the mobile phone age? Using yours in a job interview. Never ever take your phone out and look at it at any point in the job interview. As far as your interviewer is concerned, you should be a troglodyte who's never even heard of an app. Turn your phone all the way off, keep it in your car, and never, under any circumstances, give the interviewer the impression that a text message takes precedence over getting this job.  In the interview, it's not the time to ask about benefits, the possibility of a raise, or really even bring up the topic of money. If you're applying for a job, it's time to focus on your skills and qualifications.  Sometimes, you'll be prompted to provide a base salary requirement for the job. The best answer for this is that you're willing to work for the lower end of the average salaries for your position. Express that you really want the job and that you'll be fine with what's being offered in the legal limit.  Never get defensive in an interview, even if you feel like you're not getting on perfectly with the interviewer. It's supposed to be a conversation, so try to assume the best in people. Nobody is trying to antagonize you on purpose. Treat it as a chance to prove yourself and come up with a good explanation, not a defensive snark.  Making petty comments about previous coworkers, superiors, or other job in general should be avoided. Even if you're applying for a rival business, avoid painting yourself like someone with a grade, or like someone who'll be difficult to work with. It's bad form to gripe about your previous job.  If you're asked why you're leaving your current job, say something positive. 'I'm looking for more out of my work environment and I'm excited about getting a fresh start. To me, this looks like a great place to do it.'  , Even if you indulge in the occasional smoke, avoid smoking before a job interview. A recent study revealed that up to 90 percent of employers would hire a nonsmoker over a smoker of equal qualification. Right or wrong, smoking makes the interviewee looks nervous.Likewise, having a few drinks to soothe tense nerves should always be avoided. You want to be sharp and on point, not sloppy. Interviewers will expect you to be nervous. It’s a job interview.  Billionaire mogul Richard Branson claims to hire primarily based on personality, as opposed to experience or quantifiable skills. Each job is different and the essential aspects of the job can be learned. Focus on selling yourself and letting your true personality shine through, not on trying to be something you’re not.  ","don’t show up with coffee. turn off your phone and put it away. don't talk about money. treat your interview like a conversation, not an interrogation. don’t knock your previous boss. avoid pre-interview cigarettes and alcohol. don’t be afraid to reveal yourself.

"Use dialogue to add humour to a screenplay. Have witty back and forth between characters. Have one character who is full of funny one-liners. Create running jokes that are said throughout the screenplay by different characters. Dialogue gives you a chance to have your characters tell jokes to one another and be witty.For example, you may have one character who uses a signature catch phrase and tone of voice to say their dialogue, creating humor.  Develop a character over a long period of a time in a novel so they become endearing, witty, and funny to the reader. Give them a funny childhood or a unique sense of humor. Let the character's voice and actions come through as the novel progresses and add in funny or amusing details about the character. The reader will then get a sense of humor from the character.For example, you may have a character who seems minor in the story but always has a funny aside. You may then have them become more important as the novel progresses, putting their humor front and center.  The element of surprise can be a fun way to jolt your reader and make them laugh. Have a plot twist in the play that you find funny and surprising. Keep the viewer guessing and use the element of suspense to create surprise and laughter.For example, you may have a big reveal 3/4 of the way into the play where a character turns out to be a woman dressed as a man. You may stage the reveal so it is funny and surprising for your audience.  ","emphasize comedy in screenwriting with dialogue. use long-term character development in a comedic novel. surprise the reader in a comedic play. "

"Use a squeegee, towel or cloth to dry all tiles after they get wet. Make sure you have a bathroom fan or window that can suck the excess moisture out from the air.  If you do not do this, grout will absorb excess moisture, which will turn into mold and mildew. It will stain and breakdown the structure of the grout, causing it to crumble prematurely. In extreme cases, the water and mold can get behind the grout and into the tiles.;  , Many multipurpose surface cleaners are pH neutral, so check on the bottle before you buy and use it.  A neutral cleaner means that the pH, or 'potential of hydrogen' is not acidic or alkali. The potential of hydrogen is judged on a scale of 0 to 14, with 0 to 6.9 being acidic, 7 being neutral, and 7.1 to 14 being alkali. Water is also neutral, at a pH level of 7.  The frequency of deep cleaning grout depends upon the amount of traffic the bathroom gets. Deep clean every month, if it is heavily used, with 1 of the 2 methods below.  Mix 1/2 cup of powdered oxygen bleach into a gallon of water. Use a spoon to stir it until it is completely dissolved. Pour the mixture all over your dry bathroom grout. Reapply after the solution soaks into the grout, or about every 15 minutes for vertical surfaces. After 30 minutes scrub the tile and grout with a nylon brush, or a toothbrush for an extra thorough cleaning. Rinse well with warm water and dry with a towel or squeegee. The more you reapply the oxygen bleach on your tile and scrub it, the cleaner your grout will become.  Wet the surface of your bathroom tile. Fill an empty salt shaker with baking soda. Sprinkle baking soda generously all over the grout. Let it sit for 10 minutes and then scrub it with a nylon brush. Rinse well with warm water and dry immediately.  Make a paste with a small amount of water and apply it directly to the affected areas. Allow it to sit for 30 minutes. Scrub the grout with a toothbrush, and then rinse and dry it.  A penetrating sealer is important for bathroom grout, because it is absorbed into the grout's pores and protects it from mold and mildew. Some of these sealers can be expensive, but it is a good idea to choose based on quality rather than price.  Allow your tiles to dry. It will take approximately 5 days for the moisture behind the tiles to evaporate. Do not use your bathroom during this time.  Apply the sealer to a sponge. Wipe it over the tile and grout of the entire bathroom surface you want to protect. Leave the sealer on for the time indicated by the product's directions.  Wipe the excess sealer off the surface of the tile with a damp cloth or paper towels. The directions may suggest you use a pH neutral cleanser first and then rinse off the tile with a damp cloth.  Apply a second coat, if it is recommended by the product. Allow the last coat of protective grout sealer to sit overnight before you use the bathroom.  ","dry your bathroom after every shower or cleaning. clean bathroom tile and grout weekly with a ph neutral cleaner. clean the tile and grout occasionally with a mild alkali cleaner. remove mold or mildew with a stronger oxygen bleach mixture. seal bathroom grout with a latex penetrating sealer after installation, and again every year.

"Focused and controlled breathing is an important component of mindfulness and something that you can practice together as a family. In order to learn deep breathing have everyone inhale and count to four, hold the breath for a count of four, exhale for a count of four, and finally count to four before inhaling again. You could also try a fun breathing exercise called breathing buddy. Have each family member lie down in a circle with a weighted “breathing buddy” placed on their tummy. Then watch the buddy rise and fall while focusing on breathing.This will help make sure everyone is breathing properly using the diaphragm.  Slow down the breathing by counting to three as you inhale and back down to one during the exhale.  For toddlers and younger children they could use a small weighted stuffed animal as a breathing buddy. For older kids and teenagers they could use a rock, shell, or other trinket.  This is a great way to help each member relax and focus on the present. Walk through the woods while being silent and taking in the natural environment. Adults often overlook their surrounding environment and this type of activity can help you appreciate your life.Alternatively you could try walking through a crowded shopping centre. Your mind will likely focus on your surroundings rather than getting distracted by thoughts of work or other activities.  At the end of the walk ask the members of your family what they noticed while walking.  Alternatively, you could go for a walk as a family and have two to five minutes of silent time and then discuss things you noticed for the rest of the walk., Another mindfulness activity you can do as a family, involves sitting or lying down together and then focusing on different parts of the body. Allow each member of the family to announce a body part and then discuss how that part feels. This forces your mind to engage and focus on the present activity. Then ask your kids to describe how they are feeling by focusing on a specific body part.For example, you could begin by saying “I’m focused on my feet, and they are sore.” Then your partner could say “I am focused on my stomach, and it is hungry.”  Continue this exercise until interest wanes or you can just do one round daily.  Set aside five minutes each day for family meditation. Once, everyone becomes comfortable meditating, you can increase the time to ten minutes. In order to meditate, have each family member find a comfortable place to sit and then close their eyes and focus on breathing and positive visualization.  ","practice breathing techniques together. take a listening walk. focus on your bodies. meditate as a family. "
"Wear leather gloves if you're doing a lot, or use hay hooks.  Lean the bale against your pelvis as you carry it to the stacking area or to the next person.  Toss a bale if you're strong or daring enough, but don't expect the person you're tossing it to to catch it. You'll probably knock them over instead. Toss it so that it'll land near them, not on them.  You can also move the bales with a handtruck (dolly). Tip the bale on end. Lean it about 10 degrees, and put it on the handtruck. Using hay hooks can help stabilize the load.  Stack your bales 'edge side up.' The strings should be on the sides, rather than the top and bottom. The stems should run vertically, and the top of the bale when it's stacked properly will feel sharp and jagged. An easy way to remember is to refer to this side as the 'cut side up'.  Build the stack to its full footprint and then build from the corners toward the middle, making sure to keep the corners square and plumb, to assure stability when the stack gets very high (20 layers).  Tuck your bales tightly together. You can usually put them loosely in their spot and kick them firmly into place, especially if it's a tight spot. You can also shove the bale in with your knee, which would be safer.  Avoid stacking bales that are loose, or have a broken string. They will threaten the stability of the stack. Save them for the top of the stack, or put them aside to be used first. You could repair it if you have available string. Hold down the bale with your knee and tie a replacement string onto the existing string on the end of the bale and wrap it around the length of the bale and tie at the other end.  Make sure the stack height does not exceed 1.5 times the shortest base dimension. For example, if the stack is 20 feet (6.1 m) wide and 40 feet (12.2 m) long, the height should not exceed 30 feet (9.1 m).  ","grab the bale by the strings, with one hand on each string. lift with your legs, not so much with your back or arms. drop the bale on the floor or on a pallet to start your first layer. follow a stacking pattern given below.

"Stand up straight and tall. Even if you don’t feel confident, you can fake it. No one will be able to tell the difference, and pretty soon, you will start feeling more confident, too!  Use confident body language. Shake hands, smile, and avoid fidgeting or playing with your hair, which makes you appear uncomfortable.Make eye contact. Look at the person you are talking to. You do not need to stare at them intently (to do so would be rather off-putting to the other person). It’s okay to break eye contact every once in a while. But make sure you are primarily looking the person in the eyes, or at least looking somewhere on their face if direct eye contact makes you too uncomfortable.;  , Wear clothes you feel confident, comfortable, or sexy in. Wearing something that makes you feel and look good will give your self-confidence a little boost.Make sure you are dressed appropriately for the occasion. You will feel less confident if you are wearing the “wrong” clothing. If you are unsure what to wear to an event, check with a friend or colleague about what might be appropriate.  Learn more about dress codes and what you might be expected to wear for certain events. For example, jeans and a cute top are appropriate for a casual party, a party dress might work for a more formal social event, and understand your employer’s dress code to make sure what you wear to work fits within its parameters. You’ll feel more confident if your look “fits” the vibe of the environment.  You could ask, “Do you know what the dress code is for this event? What are you going to be wearing?”  , Don’t pretend to be someone you’re not just to be attractive to men. While you may need to “fake” being confident to understand how confidence feels, this doesn’t mean you should change other aspects of your personality just to attract someone to you. The men you want in your life will appreciate you for who you are, not someone you ought to be.Let your unique, interesting personality shine through. Are you funny? Show off your sense of humor! Are you involved in your community or a live music aficionado? Talk about your interests proudly. If someone doesn’t like you for you, they are not worth your time!  Stay relaxed when talking to men and don’t feel like you need to prove something. If you are having a difficult time, you could pretend that you are talking to your brother or cousin.  Smile your genuine, beautiful smile. It helps others find you more approachable, and it has the added bonus of decreasing your stress level, even if you are nervous!, Try not to be so hard on yourself. Realize that other people are probably not thinking about you or judging you nearly as much as you believe them to be.Keep a positive attitude. Don’t worry if you make a mistake or say something dumb. Laugh it off and move on. People are more attracted to others who convey confidence and who don’t seem concerned with what others think about them.  Consider the following scenario: Say you are at a party and you spill something all over yourself that leaves an obvious stain. What conveys more confidence, pointing out the mess and saying how clumsy you are, or laughing it off and forgetting about it? Staying positive and not beating yourself up will help you have more fun!  While alcohol and drugs can make you feel disinhibited, do not resort to using substances to make you feel this way., Take a look at confident women around your workplace or at a social event. They will radiate confidence throughout the room, and project a sense of feeling comfortable in their own skin. Watch what they do, and what makes them so at ease. Try to mimic their behavior.Remember, fake it ‘til you make it. Trying out new behaviors can feel uncomfortable and awkward for a while, but if you are consistent in your practice, you may soon feel like they’re a part of who you are.  Consider asking a friend whose confidence you admire what she does to make herself appear so confident. For example, you could say, “I’m always so impressed by how confident you appear in social situations. What’s your secret?”  , Eat well and exercise. Feeling healthy is a great confidence boost.Eating healthy can help you feel better about yourself, knowing that you are making good choices for your body. Sometimes the food we eat impacts our moods as well. Eating better may help you maintain a more elevated mood: reducing sugar consumption may help you avoid blood sugar crashes, for example.If you want to get in shape, it will give you more self-confidence to train for an event and accomplish something, rather than reach a number on a scale. Consider signing up for a race or a long-distance cycling event, for example. When you cross the finish line, you will feel proud of yourself for achieving something awesome!  , Don’t base your self-esteem on others’ opinion of you or on the things that you have. Don’t think more or less of yourself if you have a significant other or you don’t.Value the character of your heart over external factors that are easily taken away, like romantic relationships, or how much is in your bank account. Embrace your integrity, compassion, and generosity instead.  You may find volunteering, attending religious services, or meditation helpful to improve your self-worth.  ","carry yourself with confidence. dress in clothes you love. be yourself. turn off your inner critic. find confident female role models. take care of yourself. find your self-worth from within. "
"Arrange the broccolini in even layers.  If necessary or desired, you can cut the broccolini into smaller pieces. The smaller pieces can be easier to fit inside of a cramped microwaveable dish, so if you are having difficulty fitting the tall, skinny pieces in the dish, cutting them up is a viable option.  Add 3/4 cup (190 ml) water, 2 Tbsp (30 ml) olive oil, and 2 Tbsp (30 ml) lemon juice to the broccolini. Stir well so that all the broccolini has been coated in the mixture.  Ideally, the broccolini should be mostly submerged under the liquid. If some of the broccolini is submerged but some is not, it may not cook evenly.  Cover the dish with a microwave-safe lid or microwave-safe plastic wrap and cook, on high, for 5 minutes.  Pause the microwave halfway through to stir the broccolini in the dish. This is especially important if some of the pieces are submerged in liquid and others are not. This can be skipped, however, if all of the pieces are evenly submerged.  Pour the contents of the dish through a colander to drain the water. Season with salt and pepper, to taste, and enjoy.  ","place the broccolini in a microwave-safe dish. add water, lemon juice, and olive oil. microwave until tender. drain, season, and serve. "
"Drinking fluids can help keep you hydrated so that your blood will pump through your body and help keep your blood pressure up. Water is always a good way to stay hydrated. You can also drink sports drinks that contain sodium and potassium.Avoid drinking alcohol because it will dehydrate you.  Salt can help keep your blood pressure elevated by helping with the retention of fluids. Talk to your doctor about adding salt to your diet. Never add salt to your diet if you have hypotension without a doctor’s recommendation., Anemia, which can be caused by a lack of red blood cells, can lead to low blood pressure. Low B12, especially in elderly and very thin people, can cause hypotension. Certain B vitamins can help you produce red blood cells and increase your blood pressure. Consider increasing your intake of foods full of vitamin B12 and folate.B12 can be found in meats, such as beef liver, grass-fed beef, sardines, tuna, salmon, shellfish, and lamb. You can also find it in dairy products, like cottage cheese, eggs, and raw milk.B12 can also be given in monthly shots or taken in supplement form. However, the uptake time of B12 found in supplements is very slow.  Folate can be found in beans and lentils. Green vegetables also have folate. Try spinach and other dark leafy greens, asparagus, lettuce, and broccoli. You can also find folate in avocados and cauliflower., Eating smaller meals more frequently through the day can help reduce dizziness and keep your blood pressure level. Make your meals low in carbohydrates. Don’t try to do too much after the meals. Rest and take it easy so your blood pressure doesn’t drop.

"If your baby was born at full term and has no major health problems, you can start tummy time as soon as you get home from the hospital or birth center – just remember not to put your baby on his or her stomach to sleep (this increases the risk of sudden infant death syndrome, or SIDS). Newborns will not be able to move much at first, so limit the time to a few minutes and watch carefully to make sure your baby is comfortable.  Some newborns may be uncomfortable on their stomachs before the umbilical stump falls off. If this is the case, you can postpone tummy time for a few weeks.;  , If your baby was premature or has health problems, get a doctor’s approval before beginning tummy time. And, as with all babies, do not put your baby on his or her stomach to sleep.  If you put a little thought into scheduling tummy time, you can maximize the odds that your baby will enjoy it. Pick a time when your baby is alert, cheerful, and unlikely to be hungry, and consider building a routine by doing tummy time right after a diaper change.  You don’t want your baby to be hungry, but in general, it’s best not to schedule tummy time immediately after a feeding, either. This could lead to spitting up.  Never do tummy time when you are putting your baby to sleep. This should be a daytime, stimulating activity.  For newborns, you can begin by lying down yourself, on your back, and placing your baby on top of you, stomach to stomach. Your newborn will feel comforted by your closeness and your heartbeat. As your baby grows, you can start using a flat surface (a big bed or a blanket on the floor) instead. Simply place your baby on his or her tummy on the flat surface; watch to be sure that your baby supports his or her head well. Be sure to stay close by and keep a watchful eye throughout the duration of the tummy time.  Babies have to work harder when they are on their tummies, so they may fuss at first when placed face down. Take it slow and pick up your baby if he or she starts crying or gets very upset.  Be sure that the arms are forward in a way that the baby could use them to prop her or himself up. Babies with arms that are restrained or twisted backwards will not only be uncomfortable, but will be unable to reap the full benefits of tummy time.  If your baby gets fussy, you can try sitting down and lying him or her across your lap. Keep one leg raised over the other, and put the baby’s head and shoulders on the elevated leg. Then you can sing, talk, and rub the baby’s back.  You can also try holding your baby under your arm on his or her stomach (taking care to support the muscles until your baby can do so). This isn’t as beneficial as true tummy time on a flat surface, though.  If your baby cannot yet use his or her hands to push up, you can roll up a blanket and place it under the arms for support. Babies sometimes enjoy this change of position.  You can also use a nursing pillow as a prop.  For very young newborns, you can start with just a minute or two at a time, then increase the time gradually, up to around an hour per day by the time your baby is four or five months old.  Your baby does not need to do an hour of tummy time all at once; it’s fine to break the time into several shorter segments.  Don’t just place your baby on his or her stomach and walk away. Instead, you can lie down, facing your baby, on your own stomach. Then just talk, sing songs, make faces – whatever feels natural and keeps your infant entertained.  As your baby grows, you’ll want to add colorful toys to tummy time. Try waving the toy in front of your infant’s head and moving it around; this will encourage your baby to lift his or her head, move it from side to side, and, eventually, to reach for the toy.  If your baby cries or protests, it’s fine to end tummy time prematurely. The key is to offer your baby the chance to get accustomed to that position and exercise different muscles, not to force your baby through some rigid program. Keep tummy time fun and interesting for your baby.  By the end of the first month, your baby may be able to lift his or her head for a short time and move his or her feet a bit, as if crawling.  By two months, your baby may be able to hold his or her head up for a longer period of time and turn it to each side.  By three months, your infant may be able to rest on the forearms and pelvis, especially with support from a blanket. By four months, you may notice that your baby can balance well on his or her stomach, and by five months, you may see that he or she will reach for toys.  Your baby will get stronger and stronger over the first few months of his or her life. By the end of the seventh month, your infant may be able to hold himself or herself up with one hand while reaching for a toy with the other.  Some babies begin to crawl in the eighth or ninth month. You may also see your baby start to pull up to something like a standing position.  ","start tummy time immediately for a healthy, full-term baby. talk to your pediatrician if you have any concerns about putting your baby on his or her stomach. choose the best time. start with a familiar, comfortable position. adjust the baby's arms. change the position. prop your baby up. increase the time slowly. keep your baby company. incorporate toys. don’t force the issue. watch for your baby’s ability to lift his or her head. look for head turning. pay attention to your baby’s balance. watch your baby’s strength develop. look for signs of mobility.

"Do your best not to lie to anyone, whether they’re strangers or your loved ones. Someone you’ve just met could turn out to be a close friend or romantic partner in the future. You wouldn’t want to misrepresent yourself, then pursue a relationship on the basis of a lie.Suppose you meet someone at a party, and the two of you start talking about cars. You pretend to love cars because you want them to like you, but you actually hate cars and don’t even have a license. You become friends and eventually start dating, but they still have no idea that you misrepresented yourself. Even if it was a little white lie, it was still an inauthentic way to pursue a relationship.  Try not to settle for small talk, especially with those closest to you. Talk about your dreams, beliefs, fears, the world, and other complex subjects to deepen your relationships.Having a meaningful conversation doesn’t mean you have to be overly intellectual. You could talk about childhood, your cultural traditions, or what you hope to do with your life.  Pay attention to how you feel when you have these conversations. If you begin to feel a little uncomfortable (perhaps you notice that the person you're talking to disagrees or disapproves of what you're saying), try to push through and continue the conversation. This is good practice for you to learn to be your authentic self, even when challenged. This doesn't mean you have to be rude or defiant, just don't veer away from a disagreement or change your opinion because someone disagrees.  You should still be open to other points of view and ideas. The person disagreeing with you may have great points and ultimately change your mind — there's nothing wrong with this, as long as you are not just coming around to their view point because you are uncomfortable being in disagreement.  You may find that the more you get used to being open, honest, and authentic, the more others are willing to be authentic with you.  As you become more comfortable being your authentic self, you can use your new skills to lead and inspire others. You and your friends can each other to pursue authenticity and live thoughtful, examined lives. Know the difference between having a friend who accepts your authentic self and one who’s just a “yes person.”A 'yes person' would just agree with everything you do or say, but wouldn't share how they really feel. An authentic friend tells you the truth, even when they disagree with you.  If your friend, family member, or partner tells you that you haven’t been yourself lately, listen to what they have to say. Remember that the relationships you pursue help you stay authentic. Our loved ones help us see our blind spots and challenge us to stay true to ourselves.  ","try not to lie to people. have meaningful conversations with your friends and family. challenge your friends and let them challenge you. "

"Traditionally, making brandy at home was a way to capture and preserve the flavors and fragrances of summer and fall fruits. Pears, apples, grapes, peaches or plums were gathered, processed into wine, then distilled into fruit brandies. If you want to make your own wine, you'll need to gather your fruit and start the fermentation process at least a month before you distill it to make brandy. If you'd prefer to start distilling right away, purchase a few liters of fruit wine and skip to the next section.  Wait until the fruit you want to use is in season, and harvest at the peak of ripeness.  For this recipe, you'll need about 3 quarts of fruit, which will yield enough wine to make a small batch of brandy. Harvest and ferment more fruit if you want more brandy.  Commercial brandy is usually made from grape juice or crushed grape skins. The resulting distillate is harsh in taste, so it's aged in oak barrels to take off the edge.Brandy made from fruit other than grapes is more suited to making at home, since it doesn't require oak barrel aging.;  , Wash it thoroughly, then cut it into slices. There's no need to peel the fruit, but you should remove pits for this recipe.  Place the fruit in the jar, then use a potato masher or another instrument to mash it down. This will help the fermentation process go more quickly.  If you're using berries, which are lower in sugar than other types of fruit, you'll need to add sugar. Line the bottom of the crock with sugar, then add a layer of fruit. Add more sugar, and continue layering until the fruit and sugar have been used up.  Use a stone crock large enough to accommodate all of the fruit with a few inches to spare, since the mixture will bubble up during the fermenting process. If you don't have a stone crock, you can use a glass bowl or another thick, heavy container. It should be made of glass or ceramic, not wood or metal.  Dissolve 6 teaspoons of dry yeast in a cup of warm water. Use active dry yeast, not instant yeast, found at any grocery store. Pour the yeast mixture over the fruit and sugar mixture. Add six cups of cold water.  The liquid inside will begin to bubble up during the fermenting process, so you'll need the tray to catch any overflow. Leave the mixture in a cool place for a week.  Uncover the crock and use a clean, long-handled spoon to stir it thoroughly, then place the cover on top. Each week the alcohol content will increase.  At the end of four weeks, pour the wine into glass bottles and cover tightly. You can store the wine for several months to deepen the flavor.  To make brandy at home, you'll need a still small enough to operate on your stove top. A 1 1⁄2 to 2 liter (0.4 to 0.5 US gal) alembic copper still will probably be sufficient for your needs.To find a still, look in local kitchen supplies stores, online, and in secondhand stores. You'll be able to use it to make other spirits in addition to endless batches of brandy.  If you purchase a new or secondhand still, be sure to clean it before using.  If you want to experiment with a very small batch of brandy, you can construct a still with a copper tea kettle and plastic tubing.  If you find that you enjoy making brandy so much that you'd like to make larger batches, you can upgrade to a 5 gallon (18.9 L) still. Anything larger than this will be too big for home brandy-making.  In addition to your base wine and still, you'll need an array of clean glasses, a ladle, and other supplies to complete the distillation process. Gather the following materials and set them out in a clean workspace within easy reach of the stove:  A Dutch oven or another pot large enough to fit the still inside. This will be filled with water and used as a double boiler of sorts to give you maximum control over the heating of the still.  Plenty of glass containers. As the still does its work, you'll need small, clean glass containers to hold what comes out of the pipe.  A graduated cup will come in handy if you want to measure exactly how much you have.  A sealable large glass jar, for storing the finished brandy.  A towel, for wiping up any spills that might occur.  First, fill the Dutch oven with a few inches of water. Put the still inside. Add more water if necessary; it should rise about three quarters of the way up the sides of the still. Set the Dutch oven and still over a gas burner or whatever heat source you're using.  If you're using a large 5 gallon (18.9 L) still, it won't fit inside a Dutch oven, so you'll need to skip this and place the still directly over your heat source.  No matter what size still you're using, leave the top 1/4 of the still empty. When the wine heats up, it can bubble and rise, so it's important not to fill the still all the way.  Place the lid on the still, then connect the tube from the lid to the condenser coil. Place cold water in the condenser and set a glass under the spout to collect the alcohol that flows from it. Different still models will require slightly different assembly, so read the instructions that came with your still carefully. It's vital that you follow the directions that came with the still you have to ensure the distillation process runs smoothly.  When making brandy, you never want to let the contents of the still get too hot; the distillation process should be slow and steady. The wine should come to a good simmer, but not a boil. Start heating the still with a strong flame, and keep it strong until alcohol beings to drip from the spout. If the alcohol begins dripping too quickly, you'll need to turn down the heat. Do not let the alcohol drip faster than 1 drop per second.You'll know the alcohol is going to start flowing soon by touching the copper tube where it enters the water. When it becomes hot, the alcohol is about to flow.The slower the liquid flows from the spout, the better quality your brandy will be.  The first distillate that comes from the still, about 7.5 ml per 1.5 liters (0.4 US gal) of wine, is called the foreshots, and it contains a toxic combination of acetone and methyl alcohol. Measure out the emerging foreshots or take a whiff; when the strong, sharp smell of chemicals abates, it's done flowing. The foreshots should be thrown away; there's nothing drinkable there.  The next liquid to emerge will be the heads, which is a combination of acetone, methyl alcohol, methanol, and ethyl acetate. If you're planning to make a second batch of brandy sometime soon, it might be worth saving the heads, which may be distilled a second time to preserve the 'good' ingredients and remove the 'bad.' It's also fine to simply throw the heads away.  Collect the heads in small glasses. You'll want to be able to save every drop of the hearts - the good stuff - which is coming out next. Collecting the distillate in a big glass increases the chances that everything will get muddled together.  Keep smelling the distillate as it flows. The heads will smell better than the foreshots, but not nearly so sweet and pure as the hearts.  The heads and foreshots together will comprise the first 30 ml per 1.5 liters (0.4 US gal) of wine.  When the hearts start to come, the smell of the distillate will have hints of the fruit you used to make your wine. You'll smell pear, peach, plum or apple essence without the harshness of acetone. The distillate should be clear, not milky. Continue collecting it in small glasses, monitoring the smell for changes.  Adjust the temperature as necessary. As the distillation process nears its end, you'll need to keep increasing the temperature to achieve the same flow rate. Keep turning it up so that 1 drop per 1-3 seconds continues to flow.  Do not overheat the still, and do not let it boil dry.  The last distillate to exit will be the tails, which is less concentrated and less tasty. You'll notice a change in smell; the fruitiness will be gone. It may also look milky. This should be discarded. When the tails comes, turn off the heat.  After the distillation process, it's important to clean your still carefully.  You should have 300 mL of drinkable brandy for every 1.5 liters (0.4 US gal) of wine you distilled. Store the brandy in the jar with a tight lid.  If you smell strong hints of acetone and methyl alcohol in your finished brandy, you can store the jar with a piece of cloth rubber banded over the top to let it breathe for a few days. The unpleasant smell and taste will leave the brandy as the acetone and methyl alcohol evaporate.  If you're not in a hurry to drink your brandy, you can mellow it out a bit by waiting a few months before drinking. Screw the lid on tightly and store it in a cool place for several months. When you open the brandy, it should have a smoother taste than it did when you first distilled it.  It's not commonly done at home, but you can distill the brandy a second time to increase the alcohol content and refine the flavor. However, since doing this makes the distillate very flammable, its not advisable to do so until you have plenty of experience operating your still.

"In addition to being able to use any type of wood in the Minecraft world to make a set of stairs, you can also use certain types of stone:Bricks (made from clay)  Quartz  Cobblestone  Sandstone (mined or made from sand)  Nether brick;  , You'll need six blocks of the same material to create a set of four stair blocks. In order to do so:Stone - Mine any kind of stone (cobblestone, sandstone, mossy stone, stone bricks, etc.) with at least a wooden pickaxe.  Wood - Mine any kind of wood (jungle, birch, oak, etc.) with any tool. Use an axe for the quickest production.  To do this, right-click the crafting table (computer edition) or press your console controller's left trigger while facing the table.  If you don't have a crafting table, you can press E (or X for consoles) and use four wood planks to create a crafting table.  To create stairs, you'll need to place three blocks in the first column of the crafting table, two in the second column, and one in the third.  You'll need to place your blocks starting on the bottom row of the crafting table.  If you're using the Xbox version of Minecraft, simply scroll over to the stairs icon and then scroll up or down to select your preferred material.  It's to the right of the crafting table interface.

"A lot of counties don't put information about the deed itself online, and this is even true of counties that put tax assessor's records online. The most important information the deed itself will show (that the tax assessor's records won't) is who held the deed before the current owner and what kind of deed they had. Unless a person is making sure that a title is clear, this information is of limited use to the general public.The government entity that keeps these records is usually called the 'county recorder' or 'county register of deeds.' However, 'recorder of deeds,' 'deeds registrar,' and 'deeds registry' are also common. If you find one of these, there's a good chance your records are online. Again, don't hesitate to call and ask if this information is online. If you are unable to find a website for the relevant county recorder, try using one of these private land record indexes:  http://www.realmarketing.com/county_recorders/county_recorders.htm  https://www.courthousedirect.com/  http://publicrecords.onlinesearches.com/Land-Records-and-Deeds.htm  https://uslandrecords.com/  , Remember, you can find this in the tax assessor's record, sometimes referred to as the parcel number or the recording number. Many county recorders do not make the primary record of deeds by address, because things like street names can change quickly and unpredictably. When this type of deed information is online at all, it is usually searchable by book/page number, by property ID number, or by sellers' and buyers' names. Property ID is usually the most reliable and easiest way to search, because it is less prone to problems like misspellings of names and streets. , Whether you use a county records website or a private record search site, there is often a fee for searching--especially if you want to search by address. Some land record or Deed search sites may charge a one time account fee and others may charge per search or per record. These fees range in cost from a few dollars for governmental websites to ten and twenty dollars per search for some of the private websites., Once you have located a land record database and created an account, fill in as much information as possible, including the address of the property, owner’s name, or Property ID and run a search.

Place in the center of the table.  Fill each hole of the egg carton with dyed Easter eggs. You can sit them on Easter grass in each hole if wished. Place the open egg carton onto a display plate or tray and add a few fluffy chicks around the tray. Place in the center of the table.  ","turn a carton or basket of eggs into a centerpiece. "
"To help you work this out, here are some of the key features of each type of saw:  Electric chainsaws: These are lighter, don't require fuel, do not require cranking, and are cleaner than gasoline saws. They do, however, have limits as to how large a log they can cut, and require access to electric power to operate.  Battery operated chainsaws: These do not require close access to electrical outlets, but have limited run time and significantly less power than other types. They are best for light trimming or cutting small branches.  Gasoline chainsaws: These have the most power. They range from 27cc's to over 150, suitable for cutting anything from small branches to large trees. They can be temperamental and will require you to mix fuel.  Hydraulic chainsaws: These are used for clearing limbs from power lines and even cutting underwater, but generally, they are niche tools, and since they require a remote motor to provide hydraulic power, they are not suitable for most users.;  , Small jobs can be done with 12 inch (30cm) bars, and either the battery, electric, or gasoline saw, so the choice is yours which to buy.  Homelite and Poulan saws, for example, are inexpensive, and work well for most small projects. They may not hold up as well for serious cutting jobs though, in which case, spending more money on a Husqvarna, Stihl, Echo, or Jonsered saw is a better investment.  No matter what brand you choose, you will eventually need parts and service, so buying a chainsaw that offers locally provided servicing and parts is a good choice.  Nothing beats experienced advice when making a choice.  Here are some examples:  What kind of blade does the chainsaw have? There are straight blades, bow blades, different cutter size chains, and special chains for ripping, carving, and other jobs.  Select the safety features you think are important. Most chainsaws have chain brakes; however, if you buy a used chainsaw, this feature may not be available on your model. Anti- kickback bars are another feature you may want. Spark arrest mufflers and tip guards are also common on modern chainsaws.  A diminutive person wouldn't really want to handle a 165cc Stihl chainsaw with a 36' blade. These weigh in at over 45 pounds.  New chainsaws have the advantage of a manufacturer's warranty, but used chainsaws can be less than half the cost. Check what you can of the seller's background if buying the chainsaw used, such as looking at auction site feedback.  , Look for sales, promotions, and other things that effect the price of the chainsaw.  eBay and Craigslist often have listings for used (and sometimes new) saws. Be aware you won't be able to test run a chainsaw bought and shipped to your location. You might ask ahead if returns are appropriate should the chainsaw prove unworkable for your needs.  You will need fuel (or extension cords), chain lubricant, tools to sharpen and adjust the chain, and safety gear to wear while operating the tool.  ","decide whether an electric, battery operated, gasoline, or hydraulic chainsaw is the right one for your needs. decide on the size and chain configuration you will need. every brand has unique features and characteristics. find out what your local dealers can sell and service. ask friends and neighbors who use a chainsaw what they think of the available brands. choose specific features that are important to you. consider the weight of the chainsaw. decide on new or used. look in the phone book, or visit stores with a hardware section to see what they offer. , compare prices. check online sales sites for used chainsaws. remember, buying a saw is only the first step. consider buying an extra chain, since a chain can become dull or break during use, causing you to lose time.

"This helps you to effectively size up your competition and discern what is considered ‘attractive’ and ‘likable’ among both your immediate peer group and wider society as a whole. This may include, but is not limited to, the strategic utilization of social media networks such as Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, and Instagram, as well as any number of celebrity gossip columns and reality shows.  It can be helpful to take copious notes on your findings from this step, as they will likely come in handy later.;  , Set up accounts on no less than three of these websites (especially if you are under age 25). Make sure to amass a sufficient number of ‘friends’, ‘followers’, and the like on each site as quickly as possible, so as to impress others and attract larger numbers of people to your profiles. This multi-faceted approach will allow you to cultivate the illusion of physical attractiveness, humor, and popularity, which is almost certain to lend you a competitive edge in terms of so-called ‘likeability’.  Be sure that the photographs you post on these websites are properly edited and filtered. Use photos to emphasize your connections with other ‘attractive’ individuals. Being featured on their profiles can help to create a socially effective symbiotic relationship.  Include picture descriptions and other text- based updates that simultaneously communicate how witty, funny and deep you are.  This practice of strategically attractive photo-posting can be extended to pictures of you alone (often termed ‘selfies’ ), which will ideally feature excellent lighting and possibly heavy filtering using a photo-editing interface such as Instagram or Pixtr.  Note that the over-posting of these so-called ‘selfies’ can actually decrease your popularity among your peers, so proceed with caution in this particular area.  , However, do not proceed to this additional step before successfully completing the preceding ones, as things often become substantially more competitive and personally hurtful at this stage.  For an example of what can be achieved by playing this attractiveness game, simply consider Kim Kardashian, an American female celebrity who achieved stardom almost exclusively through her physical 'attractiveness' according to today's societal standards. Kardashian (and the rest of her family, which has since built a lucrative media empire on her initial success) serves as a constant reminder that popularity, and financial security can be achieved solely based on looks, even if an individual lacks any discernible talent. Overall, this new breed of celebrity (whose fame is based solely on their looks and popularity) gives hope to a generation of young people hoping to promote themselves online based on their attractiveness without the hassle of attaining success through skill development, education, or hard work.  Remember: in this modern era, image is everything, so plan accordingly and don't fall behind!  ","spend an inordinate amount of time perusing a variety of social media websites and other pop culture outlets. establish yourself on said social media sites. post large numbers of photographs of you and your aforementioned attractive friends doing fun and exciting activities (going to parties, running 5ks, posing as a group in clubs/extracurriculars, going hiking/backpacking) and pair them with witty captions and quotes. continue to be active on these websites and gain increasing amounts of social connections, so as to appear more popular and attractive to others. , visit online dating websites such as tinder, zoosk, and even beautifulpeople.com, which allow you to meet others who are likely just as interested in self-promotion and human connection as you are. study your role models and their success stories.

"To bring a successful excessive force claim, you will need proof of your injuries. You should document them soon after receiving medical treatment.Take color photographs from many different angles. Make sure the lighting is sufficient so that you capture the severity of the bite marks.  Get medical records. These records will be critical in a lawsuit, since they document the extent of your injuries.;  , Many businesses have surveillance video taken of their property. if the dog attacked you near a store (such as a convenience store), then stop in and ask if you can get a copy of the video for the day and time of the incident.The store might resist turning it over. You can subpoena a copy of the video after you start your lawsuit, although it may be too late by then.  In any event, ask who you should talk to if the store won’t turn the video over.  You can also sue for any financial loss caused by the dog bites. In particular, you can be reimbursed for lost time at work or for money spent treating the dog bites. You should gather the following:  Proof of income. You can get pay stubs, your W-2 form, or proof of self-employed income.  Receipts for money spent on medical treatment, including hospital bills, doctor bills, rehabilitation costs, and medicines or prescription drugs., You can also generally be compensated for the emotional harm of the attack as well. You can prove your emotional harm in the following ways:  Keep a journal. In the journal, you can document how the injuries affect your daily life—how they interfere with your sleep and mobility, as well as your emotions.Have your counselor, therapist, or psychiatrist testify at your trial.  Have your friends and family testify as to how your mood has changed since the injury.  Because excessive force cases are complicated, you would benefit from meeting with a qualified civil rights attorney, who can analyze your circumstances and tell you whether you have a solid case. You can get a referral to an attorney by contacting your local or state bar association.Once you have the name of an attorney, you should call and schedule a consultation.  Excessive force administrative actions and lawsuits are very complicated, and it could be difficult for you to learn everything you need to know in order to bring a successful claim. Although you can certainly meet with the lawyer only once for a consultation, you should give considerable thought to hiring him or her to represent you.  At the consultation, ask how much the lawyer charges. Since you are bringing an administrative action and suing for a civil rights violation, the defendant may have to pay your attorney’s fees and reimburse you for the costs of the lawsuit if you win.  Furthermore, the lawyer might be willing to represent you on “contingency.” This means the lawyer will get paid only if you win or settle the lawsuit. Typically, the lawyer gets 33-40% of the amount you win., Some laws require an exhaustion of remedies while others do not. If the law requires you to exhaust all administrative remedies before bringing a lawsuit, you must file an administrative complaint with the proper authority. In federal cases, this may be the Department of Justice (DOJ). In state cases, it may be the police department or some other state agency. However, some laws do not require an exhaustion of remedies before bringing a lawsuit. If you work within one of those laws, this process might not be necessary.  For example, if you want to bring a lawsuit for excessive force under the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Office of Justice Program (OJP), you must first exhaust administrative remedies.  However, if you want to sue under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, there is not exhaustion requirement., Federal administrative complaints will usually be handled by the DOJ. When you file a complaint, you need to access a complaint form or create your own complaint that contains all of the required information. Once you complete your complaint, it needs to be sent to the proper recipient. Check with the DOJ website for up-to-date information. In general, your complaint needs to contain the following information:Your personal information  The name of the law enforcement agency involved  A description of the wrongful conduct (i.e., the police dog misconduct)  The contact information of witnesses that can corroborate your story  An explanation of why you believe you were discriminated against (if you are making this claim)  , If you are filing a state complaint, determine where your complaint needs to be sent. For example, in Riverside, California, a complaint can be lodged with the police force's internal affairs division. They have complaint forms available at multiple police station locations throughout the city. You can also file a complaint online.Complaint forms will usually require you to include the following information:The location of the incident  Your personal information  Contact information for witnesses  A description of the actions that led to you making the complaint  , Once the complaint is received, the state agency will classify it and investigate it. In Riverside, there are multiple classifications including informal, incomplete, frivolous, and formal complaints. If your complaint is designated as formal, they will conduct an investigation. The internal affairs department will follow up with witnesses, interview the officer controlling the dog, and interview you. The department may also visit the site where the alleged misconduct took place.  Once the investigation is complete, the internal affairs department will write up a memorandum of their findings., The memorandum of findings will be forwarded along up the chain and reviewed by someone else. This person will determine what actions need to be taken based on the findings provided. Once a final disposition has been made, you will be notified of the results.At this point, if you do not agree with the findings or disposition of your complaint, you can usually file a lawsuit in court.  Excessive force lawsuits are hard to win. In order to prevail, the officer must have had the dog intentionally bite you; an accident can’t give rise to a lawsuit. You also have to argue that the use of the police dogs was “objectively unreasonable” based on the circumstances. This analysis focuses on what the officer knew at the time and not on 20-20 hindsight. A court will look at the following factors to determine whether using the dog was objectively reasonable:Were you resisting arrest? If so, then use of the dog is more likely to be reasonable.  How long did the dog bite you? The shorter the duration, then the less likely that excessive force was used. However, if a dog bit you for far longer than it was necessary to subdue you, then you have a stronger argument that the dog bite was objectively unreasonable.  Did you threaten the officers, physically or verbally? If so, then the police use of the dog is more likely to be reasonable.  How serious was your suspected offense? The more serious the crime (such as murder, armed robbery), then the more likely it is that using the dog was reasonable.  Were you armed or suspected of being armed with a weapon? If so, then the use of the dog is more likely to be reasonable.  Did you receive a warning ahead of time? If you did, then it is more likely that the use of force was reasonable.  You can bring an excessive force lawsuit against the officer who used the dog against you. However, you can also sue the police department, town, or county if you think they are also responsible for your injuries.You should discuss with your attorney whether you should add them as defendants.  For example, the police department might have been negligent in training its officers when to use dogs or in choosing the dogs to add to its K9 unit.  Also, the town could be consciously depriving you of your constitutional rights by not supervising the police or by adopting a K9 policy that is unconstitutional.  If you want to go ahead with your lawsuit, you should draft a “complaint,” which identifies you and the officer who used excessive force. In the complaint, you should provide the factual background of your lawsuit and also make a demand for monetary compensation (called “compensatory damages”).  Your court may have a printed, “fill in the blank” complaint form you can use. There is also a complaint form the U.S. Courts publish which you can use for suing in federal court., Once you have completed the complaint, you should sign it and make copies. You have to file the original with the court clerk. You can take the complaint to the federal court for your district and file.  You will probably need to fill out other forms at the courthouse. For example, some courts will have you complete a “cover sheet” or a form stating that you are representing yourself in the lawsuit.Ask the court clerk for all of the forms you will need.  It costs $400 to file a lawsuit in federal court.If you can’t afford the fee, then you should ask for a fee waiver form and complete it.  Notice usually consists of a copy of your complaint along with a “summons.” You can download a summons from the court’s website and complete it.The court clerk must sign the summons.  A U.S. Marshal can hand deliver a copy of the complaint on the defendant. However, the Marshals generally don’t make delivery unless ordered by the court. If you aren’t indigent or a seaman, then you typically will have to hire a private process server to make delivery.You can find process servers in the phone book or on the Internet. They generally charge $45-75 per service.  Whoever makes service must fill out a “Proof of Service” form. It should be on the back of the summons. You need to file it with the court and keep a copy for your records.  After receiving your complaint and summons, the defendant has a limited amount of time to file a response. Typically, the officer will try to get the case dismissed on the grounds that he or she has “qualified immunity.”  Qualified immunity protects a police officer from being sued unless it was clearly established federal law that using police dogs in your situation was illegal.This doctrine is as drastic as it sounds, and it generally allows most officers to escape being sued.  You will receive a copy of the “motion to dismiss” that the police officer files claiming qualified immunity.  In order to keep the case from being dismissed, you or your attorney will need to file a response in opposition. In this motion, you will argue that using the police dogs was in violation of a “clearly established federal law” at the time the dog was used.  Generally, you can prove the law was “clearly established” by pointing to either a Supreme Court or appellate court decision that establishes use of a police dog in circumstances similar to yours was illegal.For example, your appellate court might have held that officers must give a warning before using a dog. If they don’t, then they are violating “clearly established” law and cannot get qualified immunity.  The judge will probably hold a hearing to discuss the qualified immunity defense. If the officer loses the qualified immunity argument, then he or she has a right to an immediate appeal on that issue.  During discovery, you and the defendant will have an opportunity to exchange information in order to prepare for trial. This gives you a chance to determine the strength of the other party's case and find out what they will say at trial. In order to collect information during discovery, you will use the following tools:Depositions, which are in-person interviews with witnesses and parties conducted under oath. The answers given can be used in court.  Interrogatories, which are written questions posed to witnesses and parties. The answers must be given under oath and they can be used in court.  Requests for documents, which are formal requests for documents that would not otherwise be publicly available to you. Examples of documents you might request include body camera footage, emails, text messages, and phone records.  Requests for admissions, which are written statements the other party must admit or deny. This process helps narrow down what needs to be argued at trial.  As soon as discovery concludes, the defendant will try to end the litigation by filing a motion for summary judgment. To succeed, the defendant must prove that there are no genuine issues of material fact and that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law. In other words, the judge must agree that, even if every factual assumption was made in your favor, you would still lose the case.  You will defend against this motion by filing one of your own. Your responsive motion will include evidence and affidavits showing the court that there are factual discrepancies that need to be settled at trial.In addition, if a cross-complaint was filed against you, you might file your own motion for summary judgment to try and end the litigation.  If your case is strong and you win on the qualified immunity issue, then the defendant might want to settle the lawsuit. You should certainly consider settlement, since it will save you time and money. In addition, most police forces will want to settle with you in order to avoid bad publicity and exposure. Depending on the severity of your case, you may be able to use this information to extract a good settlement out of the police.  Before entering settlement discussions, determine the absolute minimum you would be willing to settle for. For example, if you sued for $100,000, then you might be willing to settle for half that--$50,000. This is your “walkaway” point.You need a “walkaway” point so that you know when to get up from negotiations. Negotiations are voluntary, and you shouldn’t settle the case unless you feel comfortable with the amount of compensation you have gotten.  You can decide on a walkaway point by talking with your lawyer. The number will generally depend on how strong your evidence is for trial.  If informal negotiation tactics fail, consider submitting to mediation. During mediation, a neutral third party will sit down with you and the defendant to discuss the case. He or she will try to find common ground and come up with unique solutions to your dispute. The mediator will never impose their own opinions or take sides.  Years might pass before you finally get your day in court. Arguing the “qualified immunity” issue could take over a year, especially if an appeal is involved. At trial, you and the defendant will present evidence to a jury, which must be unanimous in its decision. If you were arrested because you actually committed a crime, then you should discuss with your lawyer whether to ask for a bench trial, which will be heard by the judge instead of a jury. A jury might not be sympathetic to you if you were actually guilty of a crime when you were bitten.  After the trial, if you win, you will be awarded damages. However, if you lose at trial, you might consider making an appeal. Appeals can only be filed in limited circumstances when the judge made some legal error (as opposed to a factual error) in your case. For example, if your judge applied the wrong law, you might have a quality appeal. To make an appeal, you and your lawyer will have to file an appellate brief within a certain time period after your trial ends (usually between 30 and 60 days)., Some police departments have been accused of using police dogs too often or in a racially-discriminatory manner that targets African Americans and Latinos.Police should keep statistics on the number of arrests that involve a dog bite, as well as the race of the suspect bitten.  You should try to get these statistics. You can make a request directly to the police department or use your city’s public disclosure request process.Contact your mayor’s office.  Drum up support from the public by talking about the misuse of police dogs in your city. Be sure to mention statistics and to emphasize that there are safer ways to use dogs. For example, police could have the dog corner a suspect and bark instead of biting and holding. Writing letters to the editor of a newspaper is a good way to increase this issue’s visibility.To write an effective letter, you should get to the point and not use too many words. Generally, a letter should be 300 words or fewer.  Make sure that you praise the police and acknowledge the risks they take every day for your safety. This will give you credibility.  Nevertheless, be sure to use your statistics to argue that the police are currently misusing the police dogs. Suggest how the dogs could be used properly without sacrificing officer safety.  You should probably send the letter by email, since it is the standard way to communicate now.  Your city council could adopt a law restricting the use of police dogs by the police department. Each city council operates a little differently. However, generally, individual members can introduce bills for the entire council to consider.You should meet with an individual council member who you think might be sympathetic to changing the way the police use dogs.  If the bill comes up for discussion, then you can attend meetings to present your findings and to advocate for change.  If your city will not change its K9 policy voluntarily, then you could think about bringing a class action lawsuit. In a class action, a group of people who have been injured by police dogs could sue.  You can sue for an “injunction,” which is a court order to stop using police dogs. Injunctions can be an effective way to bring about change when your government officials are resistant.Unlike police officers, cities and counties cannot claim “qualified immunity,” so you might be much more successful getting an injunction to stop the use of the dogs.  You should talk to a civil rights attorney to discuss bringing a class action lawsuit for an injunction.

"Leave three or four feet (1-1.25 meters) between the two of you.You should both be able to comfortably extend your arms to shake hands. If you stand too close, you may come across as creepy. However, if you stand too far away, they may think that you don’t want to shake hands.  Use good posture when shaking someone’s hand. This will make you look confident.  If you’re sitting, rise before shaking someone’s hand.;  , Reach halfway towards the person with your thumb extended upwards and your fingers pressed together. Lean towards the person and maintain eye contact to show that you’re interested in shaking their hand.  Smile while you extend your hand. Otherwise, you may come across as aggressive.  If the person’s right hand is injured, offer your left hand instead.  Grab the middle of their hand so that the webs of your thumbs are touching. Use a firm grip, but be careful not to squeeze too hard. Try to mirror the pressure that the other person applies.  Your fingers should be completely curled around the other persons hand.  Don’t grab the end of the person’s fingers. Otherwise, you’ll shake their limp fingers instead of shaking their hand.  As you grasp the other person’s hand, bend your elbow to lift your hands up and down. Do this two or three times.The movement should be small and precise.  Avoid swinging their hands around in a large back-and-forth movement.  Don’t pump their hand more than three times. If you do, you may come across as creepy.  After you finish shaking hands, release the other person’s hand and return to your original position. At this point, you can politely break eye contact. However, continue smiling as you talk to appear friendly.  Resist the urge to wipe your hand after shaking someone else’s. They might notice and get offended.  ","stand near the person you want to shake hands with. extend your right hand. grasp their hand. pump their hand two or three times. release their hand and lean back. "
"When planning your own touching story, it is helpful to think of other touching stories that you’ve read, reflecting on what you liked, what you didn’t like, and what you might have done differently. Without copying them, you can choose specific elements of a variety of touching stories to help shape your own story.Perhaps you’re drawn to stories that have a lot of dialogue and would like to incorporate that into your work.  Or, you might not like long, drawn out setting descriptions and may choose to write shorter descriptions.  You might find that you really enjoy reading touching stories in which love prevails over an external triumph. That’s a wonderful reflection, as it gives you a potential starting point for your own touching story.;  , One engaging feature of a touching story is that it is relatable and readers can imagine and feel what the characters are going through, so you want to think of a situation that many people can relate to. This helps ensure that the maximum number of readers will really get into your touching story. Be creative and don't do something too common; nobody wants to read yet another variation of a story they've read too many times already.Some examples include:  Loss of a loved one or pet  Marriage-related situations  A big move  Finding love  Forgiveness  Going away to college  Getting a new job  Going on a journey of self discovery  A kind gesture met by another kind gesture  , The most important characters are the protagonist ('hero') and the antagonist ('villain'). However, you will want to add some more minor characters, otherwise, the touching story will not be as interesting. When you are making up characters, write at least some backstory about each of them. Even if you don't put this in the story, it's good to keep in mind so your characters will always act 'in character'. Figure out what role each person has in the plot.You might have a notebook specifically for character development, dedicating a page to each character in which you jot down notes about them. You don’t have to use every character note that you write down. It’s better to have too much than too little, as you can always cut or revise details later.  This is where you can bring your characters to life. Imagine your protagonist. Is she from a small town? How did she end up in the big city? Where did she meet the love of her life who she’ll connect with later in the story? What’s her favorite band? Food? Author?  , Many new authors want to jump right in and write; however, it is better to do some planning beforehand. Making an outline or chart of characters, backstories, conflict, and settings helps ensure that the touching story is consistent and the plot makes sense. This also allows you to fill in any gaps in your story and change points around as necessary.Perhaps the most famous example of plotting a story is J.K. Rowling’s chart for the Harry Potter novels.Notice that she pays attention to details, planning out the action for each month of the story, as well as the plots and subplots. Everything is managed and accounted for in her hand-written spreadsheet.  You should refer to your character pages while plotting to maintain consistency.  The setting of your touching story is vitally important, serving as more than a passive backdrop. Instead, characters interact with the setting in this type of story, and the setting can, at times, offer a sort of locomotion that propels the story along. One way to relate to your audience, too, is through setting, making your story even more robust.Think about where you want your story to take place. Imagine the house, the store, the school, the city, the state, the country, and write down details of your location in your notebook.  Also consider when this is taking place. Determine what season and time your touching story is set. Does it happen to be during a holiday?  Do you imagine this taking place in one location, such as a boat dock as they wave goodbye to one another? Or do you see your story spanning sunrise and sunset both, on a boat dock and at a high school football game?  , Point of view is also important in a touching story as you want your readers to sympathize with the characters. Do you want to tell your touching story from the point of view of one character in particular so that readers become invested in them primarily, or perhaps as a third-person narrator so that readers are paying more equal attention to all of your characters?  A single-character point of view is useful because you can give your readers access to your character’s inner thoughts, their feelings, their reactions, and the story as they experience it. This interior perspective  is useful because readers become invested in that character.  On the other hand, if you have a third-person narrator in your story, a narrator that is removed and tells the story to the readers, you are able to describe more characters, but with less emotional depth. You may also incorporate free indirect discourse, which allows readers partial access to a character’s thoughts while maintaining that third-person narrator, Often you won’t know what works best for you until you sit down to write. You might decide that a pen and paper is best, or you may determine that typing on a computer works better for you. Also, you might find that writing in a particular room in your house, or in a chair outside, or at a coffee house inspires creativity. Some research suggests that our writing and retention improve when we write by hand because it slows us down, allowing us to think better., Resist the temptation to name characters, places, and the story itself, initially. Sometimes when people write, they spend too much time coming up with names rather than characterization, plot details, and other vital elements. You can (and should) go back later and work on naming your characters.Although you know your characters fairly well by now, having imagined them, written notes about them, and mapped them into your larger touching story, don’t worry about details right now like names. What’s important at this stage is the substance and to make sure that you’re focusing on writing a touching rather than gimmicky story.  What makes touching stories so effective is that the reader can emotionally connect and relate to the story, setting, characters, and plot. This emotional connection is typically predicated on something very simple, such as love or compassion, so make sure that you don’t overcomplicate or over-sentimentalize your story.For example, while it’s possible that someone has very, very bad luck, most readers won’t emotionally connect to a story in which the protagonist has over-the-top experiences (like being forced to drive a runaway train full of dynamite while trying to save her one, true love). Less is better, allowing the characters and storyline to really shine through.  You can write a deeply touching story that resonates with your audience and not be overly sentimental. In fact, you want to avoid sentimentality, instead recognizing that you can convey thoughts, emotions, struggles, and experiences without over-expressions of emotion. Don’t avoid emotions in your touching story, just avoid excess.You can tell your reader what a character is feeling very directly by just stating it. For example, “Kurt was feeling anxious as he stood on the front porch, staring at the front door that he hadn’t seen in 27 years.”  Or you can indirectly offer this by using an adjective to describe a person or a thing (noun), which tells the reader the character’s feelings about that noun, giving an indirect glimpse at their feelings. For example, “Chloe made her way down the busy street, hoping that she’d see Samantha before her horrible boss made her go back to work.”  , Remember, you want your readers to relate to and connect with your touching story and really become emotionally invested, so be intentional with your plot, actions, and characters so that you don’t slip into a sensational or melodramatic story. With a touching story, less is more.Be realistic and you’ll be relatable.  A character may have a sick parent who they are unable to financially care for, which is realistic and relatable. But it would be melodramatic to say that character also has a sick child, missing dog, and that they lost their job.  What is one touching aspect of your story that you think your readers could connect with?  , You’ll use style, tone, and vocabulary to manipulate your writing so that your story is touching, authentic, and relatable. Also, consider that your audience and medium of publication will influence the mechanics of your story. Your tone, style, and even your word choices will be different depending on who and what you’re writing for.  Your word choices will impact the mood, tone, and action of your touching story and determine how your reader responds to your touching story.If you want to set a positive tone, for example, you might describe your protagonist as modest, appreciative, cheerful, or benevolent.  On the other hand, you might describe your protagonist’s feelings as she searches the woods for her elderly Labrador Retriever one night as frantic, desperate, and terrified.  Readers emotionally resonate with sympathetic characters, making them likable and relatable, both vital to an effective touching story. Just like before, remember that less is more here. Don’t overwhelm your reader with character traits; instead, be judicious with how you portray your character, giving more meaning to that which you do offer.Typically a sympathetic character will face an obstacle, or have a worthwhile or even noble cause, or they may have a passion or love to pursue. These aspects humanize your character and give your reader a reason to root for them.  You want your reader to feel what’s happening in your touching story, and you’ll do this by bringing the characters to life and telling a believable story. Another trick is to make your story emotionally resonant, helping your readers feel what your characters feel.Rather than tell your reader how your character feels, occasionally tell your reader how the character reacts to a situation. What do they do because of how they are feeling?  For example, instead of saying, “Jose was devastated when he learned that Anna had married Sam in his absence,” tell the reader what Jose did. “Jose buried his head in the pillow and screamed after learning that Anna had married Sam while he was gone. He cried and yelled into that pillow to exhaustion, finally falling into a disturbed and restless sleep.”  , Write your first draft with the understanding that it will need a lot of work. Refer to your story map frequently as you write, but don’t worry about editing yet. Spend your time and energy generating the first draft of your story, focusing on developing your plot and characterization. #*Editing is another step in the writing process., You can never have too much backstory, even about the most minor characters. Remember that Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, Tolkien, and J.K. Rowling all paid attention to backstory and characterization, even for the most minor characters. You need to remember, though, not to overwhelm your reader with too much backstory at one time. You might need to spread out a character’s backstory over several chapters so that it’s not too much at once.If you’re writing a shorter story, you might not have the space to spread out the backstory. In that case, choose the most important details that will help your reader engage emotionally with the characters and storyline.  Touching stories are emotionally complex, and you should allow yourself the opportunity to revise, focusing on different points and areas with each “second look.” Every time you revise your touching story, approach your text with one goal in mind, such as working on character development, or transitions, or dialogue. Working on one area at a time will help you stay focused, not getting sidetracked by other issues that you notice.  Whether you read out loud to yourself, your Aunt Martha, or your cat, reading your story out loud will make you a better writer.Even better is to ask someone to read your story out loud to you. Hearing a story allows you or your readers to access the story in a different way, and will help you identify issues with tone, grammar, and syntax.  While revising, make sure that you have your story saved in more than one space. Accidents happen and you don’t want to run the risk of losing your work. Consider putting all of your drafts on a removable storage device or in cloud storage. And remember, don’t delete your drafts. Save each one and name it appropriately, just in case you want to go back and use or refer to something from a previous version of your work.  Ask someone you trust to read your touching story and give you feedback. They will be able to point out things that you may have forgotten to mention or areas that do not make sense to them. Keep in mind that they may not only have things to say about the story itself; they may have comments about the grammar as well. For example, a sentence that sounds fine to you may actually be worded awkwardly., Whether you would like to be paid for your story or not will dictate what avenue of publication you pursue. If you want to share your work without compensation, there are websites that will allow you to publish your work for free.If you decide that you’d like to be paid for your story, consider sending your story to a publishing company (and some magazines) or self-publish your text., Remember, once something is on the internet, it can never be truly erased, so consider your options before sharing your work digitally. When you sell your story, you’re actually selling the rights to publish your work, not ownership of the story. There are different rules and rights depending on which country you’re in, so make sure to look up what options are available for you. Until you’re certain what route you’d like to pursue, though, don’t share your work digitally with others., Consider if you want to be published in a magazine, or part of an anthology, or perhaps your novel will stand alone. Also, consider if you want an agent or if you’d like to represent yourself in negotiations over your work.You can hire an agent who will do the work of contacting editors and negotiating compensation for you.  You can also self-publish, which will require that you cover the cost of the publication.  You can represent yourself and contact publishing houses and editors directly.

"
"Don’t create long, drawn-out sentences. Although some variation in sentence length keeps your writing interesting, sentences that are too long can confuse the reader.  Over long sentences keep the reader on edge, delaying meaning and creating more points than can be comprehended in one go.  Instead, keep sentences shorter. Only have one or two main ideas in each sentence.  For example an overly long sentence could read: 'Learning to write better sentences can be a good way to make your writing crisper and snappier, without losing the central meaning of your sentence, and still including all the necessary details that support your thought.';  , Look at the long sentence above. How could it be rewritten into shorter, better sentences?  It has at least 3 main points, so you can divide it that way.  This could be a possible way to break that sentence up well. “Learning to write better sentences can be a good way to make your writing crisper and snappier. Additionally, you can do this without losing the central meaning of your sentence. All necessary details can still be included.”  You’ll need to add in transition words in places, such as “additionally,” to help the shorter sentences connect. Nonetheless, the shorter sentences help your reader grasp your meaning more easily.  Use a single word in place of 2- and 3-word phrases if possible.  Like varying sentence length, varying word choice makes writing more interesting; however, choosing to use longer phrases makes the writing lengthier.  Look at this example: “It was not the same as eating pie with her.”  If you change the negative to a positive, the sentence becomes shorter: “It was different than eating pie with her.”  While 2 words might not seem like that much, they do add up over a long piece of writing.  ","create simpler sentences. make long sentences shorter. use single words instead of 2-and 3-word phrases. "
"Gestational diabetes is only diagnosed in pregnant women. During pregnancy, a woman's body increases the production of certain hormones and nutrients that can cause resistance to insulin. This causes the pancreas to increase its insulin production. Most of the time, the pancreas is able to deal with making more insulin and the mother will have slightly elevated blood sugar levels, but it will remain manageable. If the body starts building up too much insulin, then the mother will be diagnosed with gestational diabetes.  If you are pregnant, you should get tested between week 24 and 28 to see if you have it. There are no symptoms, which makes it hard to diagnose otherwise. If it goes undiagnosed, it can cause problems with the pregnancy.  This type of diabetes goes away after the baby is born. It can redevelop at Type 2 later in life., Gestational diabetes does not have any obvious signs or symptoms, but the mother is at risk if she lived with diabetes before the pregnancy. If you feel like you may be at risk, you can get screened before you get pregnant to see if you might have any early indicators such as prediabetes. The only way to know for sure, however, is to be screen during your pregnancy., This test requires the patient to drink a syrupy glucose solution. Then the patient has to wait for an hour. Once the hour is up, the blood is tested for blood sugar levels. If the levels are below 130-140 mg/dl, then the patient's levels are normal. If it is higher than this, you are at risk for gestational diabetes but don't necessarily have it. You will need a follow-up test called the glucose tolerance test., This test requires you to fast overnight. First thing the next morning, blood sugar levels are tested through a blood test. Then the patient drinks another syrupy glucose solution. This drink has a higher level of glucose. The blood sugar levels are checked once an hour for three hours. If your last two readings are higher than 130-140 mg/dl, then the patient is diagnosed with gestational diabetes.  ","understand gestational diabetes. notice the symptoms. get the initial glucose challenge test. take the glucose tolerance test. "
"Healthcare professionals have the ability to test your blood type. Request the test be done at your next appointment. Alternatively, you can donate blood to an organization (e.g. Red Cross) and they will test your blood type and inform you of the results. There are four possibilities:A  B  AB  O;  , An alternative to having professionals test your blood type is to do it yourself. You can order blood type testing kits. With these kits, you will expose your blood to a series of antibodies, and draw results by analyzing which antibodies affect your blood., Knowing each parent’s blood type allows you to find which genes may be present in each parent. Different combinations of genes can express the same blood type because some genes are dominant and some are recessive. For example:The blood type O means that the parent has two O alleles. This is because O is recessive and only expressed when both alleles match.  The blood type A means that the parent either has two A alleles or one A and one O. This is because A is dominant and will be expressed any time it is present.  The blood type B means that the parent either has two B alleles or one B and one O. This is because B is dominant and will be expressed any time it is present.  The blood type AB requires one A allele and one B allele. Both are dominant and expressed equally.  Testing for the most prominent blood antigens (A and B) will determine whether you are A, B, AB, or O. However, the Rh factor is another important antigen that can affect how your blood reacts to a transfusion and can be vital for pregnant women. Testing for the Rh factor is similar to testing for the other antigens. The blood is exposed to antibodies, if it reacts, you are Rh positive. If it does not react, you are Rh negative. While this factor is important for medical purposes, it is not needed for simple blood typing predictions. Considering the Rh factor makes the prediction more complicated as it doubles the number of possible blood types:A+  A-  B+  B-  AB+  AB-  O+  O-  , A Punnett square is used to find genotype. Start making the square by writing all of the possible alleles of the father down a column on the left hand side. This accounts for the first half of the baby’s genetics.For example, if the father has the blood type “A,” you would need to list allele combinations “A,A” and “A,O.” That would mean you have four alleles going down the leftmost column (three A’s and one O).  Next, write the mother’s possible alleles across the top row. These alleles account for the other half of the baby’s genetics. This will allow you to predict which alleles the baby could inherit from the mother and the father.For instance, if the mother had the blood type “AB,” there is only one allele combination that could produce it. That means you would write two alleles in the first row (one A and one B).  A Punnett square can be used to determine other traits as well. For example, you can use a Punnett square to predict your baby’s eye color.  The number of rows in a Punnett square is set by the number of possible alleles on the father’s end. This will vary depending on the father’s blood type. If the father has a homozygous blood type, there will be fewer rows. If his blood type could be heterozygous, there will be more rows.Homozygous means that the father carries only one type of allele (O,O). Heterozygous means that the father carries two different alleles (A,O).  Just as the number of rows depends on the number of the father’s alleles, the number of columns depends on the mother’s alleles. You should draw a separate column for each allele that the mother could possess. Any allele she has could be passed down to the baby., Each square in the Punnett square represents a blood type that the baby could have. Within each square, write the allele from the mother and the allele from the father that correspond to the row and column of that square.For example, you would fill in the first square with the “A” allele from the father and the “A” allele from the mother.  The number of boxes present will tell you how many possible gene combinations could be passed down to the baby. This is important for determining the chances of any one blood type being passed down. Simply count the boxes to determine the number of possibilities.In the case of a parent with type “A” and a parent with type “AB,” there will be eight boxes.  Once you have counted the number of squares, count the number of each blood type. There are likely duplicates in some of the squares. The duplicates mean that there is a higher chance for that blood type emerging in the baby.For example, you might have eight squares total with three AA’s, three AB’s, one AO, and one BO.  To do this calculation, you only need to take the number of squares occupied by a certain blood type and divide it by the total number of squares. Playing off of the example above, the chances of each blood type would be:AA = ⅜ = 37.5% chance  AB = ⅜ = 37.5% chance  AO = ⅛ = 12.5% chance  BO = ⅛ = 12.5% chance  ","have your blood type tested by professionals. test your blood type at home. determine possible allele combinations for both parents’ blood types. include rh factor. make a column for the father’s possible alleles. put the mother’s possible alleles across the top row. draw a row corresponding to each allele in the first column. place a column under each allele in the first row. write out possible blood types. count how many boxes are present. add up the number of each blood type. calculate the percent chance of each blood type.

"You can purchase dust powder or bathing sand from a pet store. These may be for rabbits or chinchillas, but can be used for the hamster., Pick a container that is made of ceramic, but is fairly shallow. These containers should not be easily overturned. Fill the container enough to allow the entire animal space to roll in it. Allow the hamster a few minutes to roll around in the sand., Use a soft brush or clean Hold the hamster in one hand, or let a helper hold them rag. Gently dust off the hamster with the soft brush or rag.Avoid the eyes, ears, and mouth. Use quick, light strokes.  Clean the dish out thoroughly with water, and towel dry it to make sure it’s completely dry before a later use.Use a fresh batch of dust or sand each time  , If brushing and bathing doesn’t improve your long haired hamster’s fur then you may resort to trimming. Avoid holding the hamster on its back while you do this. Keep it held in your hand or the hand of a helper. Use a small pair of scissors to trim just a little at a time from the matted fur.Trimming may even be preferable to the hamster  Feed the hamster a small piece of fruit or vegetable to keep it calm during the process.  Get a shampoo specifically designed for hamsters or small pets from a pet store or pet aisle. Set some towels around to protect against splashing.Make sure you’re in an area you don’t mind getting wet like a sink or basin.  Wet baths are usually not a great idea for hamster’s as they can remove essential oils from the hamster’s coat.  Use a soft grooming brush. Hold the hamster in one hand, or let a helper hold them. Pour a little of the shampoo onto the brush with some warm water. Work it into the hamster’s fur with brief light stokes.Avoid the eyes, mouth, and ears.  Use a soft towel. You can cradle the hamster in the towel as long as the hamster has support, and feels safe. Make sure to gently pad down all of the hamster’s fur so it’s dry. Don’t be so rough you scrape the skin.If the hamster seems to be panicking or squirming then revert to the single hand-held method.  Check for drafts. You want to make sure the hamster is not exposed to any cold air vents, wind, fans, or anything else that might make it cold while wet. You need to leave it in this warm place until its fur is completely dry.You might want to leave some rags, treats, and toys for the hamster to have while it waits.  Use a pair of small human nail clippers or nail clippers designed for a pet such as a cat. Hold the hamster in one hand or the hand of a helper and clip the lower tips of the nails. You want to take extra care not to clip too far up the nail and risk clipping a blood vessel. If you trim the “quick” or blood vessel then you can use some baking soda on the area to help stop the bleeding.Usually a hamster wears down their toenails through digging and climbing, but if the nails are growing so long they harm the hamster’s ability to walk or function then you can try trimming them.  Remove the hamster to a temporary holding area like a shoebox. Completely remove all bedding from the main cage into a trash bag or similar disposable container. Thoroughly cleanse the cage with water, and dry it with towels or paper towels. Once try replace the bedding with a less entangling material.Tangles can occur with paper bedding too, but this might be a slightly better option. Consider sawdust as a bedding material.  You can buy chew toys from a pet store. You can also improvise some gnawing elements for the hamster by putting in a small piece of untreated wood or tiny untreated branch from a hardwood tree. These all need to be pesticide free. Hamster teeth, like that of other small rodents, grow continuously. Hamsters need something to gnaw on to keep their teeth at a comfortable length.  Trees that tend have good wood for hamsters to chew include aspen, oak, apple, and cherry.  Do short cleaning sessions especially with the brush and bathing techniques first. Increase the time you spend cleaning the hamster’s fur for each session until you can get a complete cleaning and drying session performed.Matted fur can be a problem as the coat comes in later, but you want the hamster used to the cleaning routine early  ","set up a dust bath. pour some of the dust or sand into a container. brush the hamster. remove the bathing dish. trim the fur. try a wet bath. shampoo and brush the hamster. dry the hamster. put the hamster in a warm place. trim excessively long nails from your hamster. change the bedding. put objects into the cage for teeth length. start cleaning sessions when the hamster is young.

"Corydoras are not very large fish, and generally don’t need too much room. A 20-gallon tank should be plenty big enough for a small school of non-dwarf Corydoras (about 4 to 6 fish). Of course, if you consider adding more fish, whether Corydoras or something else, you’ll need a bigger tank.There is a traditional “rule of thumb” that suggests 1-gallon per inch of fish that you put in the tank. This can be a good starting point for thinking about tank capacity, but keep in mind this rule is more accurate when measuring the *volume* of a fish. A ten-inch long fish probably is about 50-150 inches in volume, requiring a much larger tank than 10 1-inch-long fish that total to about 8 inches in volume. It is always best to err on the side having more space for your fish.;  , Corydoras are hardy and adaptable fish, but they prefer certain conditions. Make sure your water’s pH level is around 7.0, and the temperature range between 70 and 78 degrees. Keep levels of nitrates and ammonia low, as these chemicals can cause sickness., Corydoras are bottom feeders, and like to swim and explore near the bottom of the tank. To protect your fish, use smooth gravel or sand, with a depth of at least 2 inches. Sharp or dirty bases can damage their barbels (the whiskers near the mouth that help the fish look for food) so stick to the fine grains.You don’t want to use small stones, as Corydoras like to dig around, and they need something they can lift up and root through.  Corydoras are from areas with lots of vegetation and hiding spots, so it is important to have those in your tank. Bushy plants with lots of stems at the base are important, as well as bogwood or other decor that creates areas the Corydoras can hide from other fish., Corydoras are bottom-feeding catfish, so they will eat pellets and flakes that sink to the bottom of the tank. Make sure you watch your fish eat, and avoid overfeeding by not giving them more food than they can eat in five minutes. If there is extra food in the tank, remove it to keep your tank clean.Corydoras are omnivores, meaning they eat both plant and animal matter. For an occasional treat, you can include frozen and live foods that sink to the bottom to complement a more regular diet of flakes and pellets. Though they may scavenge on the bottom of your tank, that food will not be enough, so make sure you supplement it with a variety of supplements to give your fish the right nutrition.  Because Corydoras are nocturnal fish, the best time to feed them will probably be in the evening, before you turn out the lights for the night.  Corydoras are social fish, and generally prefer to swim in schools. For Corydoras, a school is a group of five or more. There are over a hundred different species, and while they will tend to school together if possible, Corydoras are generally sociable with other Corydoras. If you have one, it would probably enjoy some company.Depending on the pet store, species may or may not be sold together. Talk to the pet store about making sure you are getting the same species, and use your own eyes to compare size and color to find fish that appear to be the same.  Corydoras are unaggressive, non-territorial fish, making them perfect tank mates for a variety of other fish. One thing to consider would be to include surface and mid-level fish, which will help balance out your tank, and give people lots to look at.Good partners for your Corydoras include fish like the Otocinclus Catfish, Tetras, Swordtails, Guppies, Dwarf Cichlids, and other similar-sized fish. Filter-feeding shrimp and snails also make good company. Some of these smaller fish see Corydoras as “dither fish” (a sign that there are no predators ). This will reduce fear, and help to make their transition to a new tank easier.  Bad partners for your Corydoras include cichlids, roughens, aquarium crayfish, and fish that are larger than your Corydoras. These can injure, or even eat, your Corydoras.  If you decide to breed your Corydoras to make more, you of course need to know that you have both males and females. The differences are easy to notice, and you can check them by looking at your fish from above. Females will be a little larger, with a rounder and broader body, while males tend to have slightly larger pectoral fins.If you intend to breed your Corydoras, you should try to get a ratio of two or three males for each female.  If your fish are ready to spawn, you will notice the males chasing the females and mating in the T position. Once they have mated, the female will lay her eggs against the aquarium glass, or among the leaves of the plants in your tank.In the wild, Corydoras usually spawn during the rainy season, so you can encourage mating by simulating these conditions. If you begin to notice your Corydoras engaging in spawning behavior, perform a water change with slightly cooler water.  Once you notice eggs in the tank, you should separate them from the parents. Corydoras will eat their own and each other’s eggs, so if you want new Corydoras, you should make sure the eggs and parents are in different tanks.One way to do this is to move the Corydoras to a separate breeding tank when you start to notice them spawning. Once the females lay eggs in the tank, you can move the fish back into their regular tank, and let the eggs hatch in peace.  You can also remove eggs to their own hatching and raising tank after they have been laid. Keep the water conditions as similar as possible. If the eggs were laid in the plants, you can simply transfer the plants. If you’d prefer not to remove the whole plant, it is fine to cut off the parts where the eggs are and just move that. If the eggs are on the side of the tank, remove them by rolling your finger over them. Eggs are tough, so you shouldn’t do any damage removing them this way.  The eggs should hatch in three to five days. Once that happens, the new hatchlings, called “fry,” will be able to survive on their yolk sac until they start swimming freely. Once that happens, provide some brine shrimp nauplii (a type of larva) or decomposing plant material for them to eat. After about a week, you can start including microworms into their diet.

"When butting heads with a difficult person, decide when it is worth your efforts to discuss the problem.Not every fight needs to be fought. The sooner you realize this the happier your life will become. Ideally, you and this difficult person would be able to set aside your differences and compromise. Sometimes, this is impossible.  Ask yourself if the situation is causing you enough distress that it must be addressed.  Consider your relationship to this person. If it's your boss or another authority figure, you have to accept some things you don't like (unless it's abusive behavior).If it's a friend or family member, think about whether choosing not to engage is enabling bad behavior or simply saving you time and grief.  Can you even win this fight? You might really, really, want to take on someone that irks you. But you may have to size up the situation, and consider if it really is one that you can reach your goal. Or, the timing is bad. Or you may have to decide if you need to really formulate a plan, get help, or consider your options.;  , Take a deep breath before responding to collect your thoughts and calm your emotions. If your conflict is happening via email or texting, try to avoid sending digital text messages when upset. Take a bit of time to let your stress level decrease. Then you will be able to approach the person more reasonably.If possible, discuss your issue somewhere neutral or in a place with an activity. For example, you could talk while walking. This can limit negative face-to-face interactions., Don't give the person the opportunity to manipulate you or twist your words.Aim to use “I” statements rather than “you” accusations. For example:  ”I understand that you are frustrated by my lateness. I would feel the same way. Unfortunately, the subway line was down this morning and we were stuck in the station. I am very sorry for making you wait!”  Do not say: “You are unreasonable for expecting me to be punctual when the subway system was broken down. If you really cared, you could have googled my line and checked.”  , No matter the response of the other person, keep your cool. Do not resort to name-calling. Take breaths before your responses. The key is to not let yourself sink to the other person’s level. Also, the calmer you remain, the more likely the other person will notice and reflect on his or her behavior., Keep a short clear narrative that is not bogged down with too much detail or emotion. It is very possible you won’t be able to get the person to see your point of view and you don’t need to try to convince them. State what happened and don't feel you need to explain yourself.Avoid trigger topics.For example, if you always fight about holidays with your sister-in-law, don’t discuss them! Have someone else do the mediating.  Avoid being defensive.You might want to argue your point but with difficult people, it is best to bypass these kinds of arguments. Do not waste your time trying to prove that you are right. Instead, keep the situation as neutral as possible.  Although hopefully you can deal with your problem person, if not, limit your time with her. If you must interact, try to keep things short by excusing yourself from the conversation or bringing a third party into the conversation. Stay as positive as possible and make sure to calm down afterwards.Accept that this person will likely never become the friend, colleague, or sibling you want., If you are not making headway with someone and need to do so, speak with a potential mediator. Perhaps your boss can help improve the situation. If your conflict is within the family, find a mutual party who can negotiate. Strive to share complaints only with people you trust.

But if you can’t afford it, offer to pay employees during their vacation hours at some fraction of their regular wages – for instance, half or two-thirds of their normal salary.  The amount of vacation time you allow employees to take depends on the size of your staff and schedule of your business. For instance, if your staff is quite large, you’ll be able to be more flexible than a smaller business with a lean staff.  Offering paid vacation on holidays is especially appreciated.;  , Nothing is more significant in one’s life than the birth or adoption of a new child. Show your employees you understand the importance of their new family member by granting paid family leave. Offering paid family leave allows your employees to enjoy their new child’s first weeks of life without fretting that they have to get back to work right away in order to avoid personal bankruptcy.The duration of the paid family leave you provide depends on your level of compassion. If you feel very compassionate, you could grant six weeks or more of paid family leave. If you’re less compassionate – or if your business cannot long suffer the loss of a valued and productive staff member – you might limit paid family leave to three or four weeks.  The most compassionate way to offer paid family leave is to pay your employees their full average salary while they are on leave. However, you might also choose to offer some fraction of the employee’s salary while they are on leave – for instance, 75% or 50% of their normal wages .  Nothing shows appreciation like an increased salary. Raises remind your workers that you value their commitment and dedication to the business. Reward people who work for you with a generous raise at least once each year.If you are very compassionate, you could give raises twice each year.  Don’t be stingy with your raises. Offer at least $0.25 per raise, and give more for people who have shown exceptional levels of commitment and hard work.  To decide how much a certain worker deserves, ask yourself how effective they are. Give the biggest raises to employees who missed the fewest days of work, worked the longest hours, and have produced the greatest number of sales for your business.  If your employees get to know you, and you get to know them, you’ll be able to better express and demonstrate your compassion. Listen with interest to what your employees have to say. Thank them for coming to you with concerns and problems. Invite them to speak frankly with you when they have an issue you might want to know about.Be transparent and clue your workers in to changes that you intend to make. For instance, if you intend to sell your business or bring on new management, let them know, and invite them to ask questions.  Make small talk with your workers to better understand their lives and struggles. Ask them, for instance, “How is your wife/husband?” or “How are your children?”  Speak up if any of your workers seem “off” or blue. For instance, ask, “Is everything alright? You seem a bit down.” This shows a great deal of compassion.  Thank your workers for their labor at the end of their shift. Say, “Thank you for your hard work. I truly appreciate all that you do.”  Practice humility. Always give your workers their due when your business is successful. Tell them, “This business is successful because of you and your coworkers.”  , There are lots of small things you can do for your employees to show you care about them. For instance, have lunch catered once or twice each week. Alternately, take your workers out for drinks after work to show them you care. You could also select a certain weekend date where you and your team could go see a play or movie together. Find activities or occasions where you can practice compassion towards your employees and also bond with them.  ","offer paid vacation. offer paid family leave. give raises. develop personal relationships with your employees. treat your employees. "
"If your child’s croup does not pass on its own or is more severe, your doctor may choose to prescribe a steroid like Dexamethasone. These steroids will reduce inflammation and make breathing easier.Dexamethasone is commonly prescribed because of its long lasting effect (usually around 72 hours) but it can take up to six hours to produce relief.  Epinephrine is used for croup when the child is having trouble breathing, or 'stridor,' at rest. It is given in a breathing machine and is called 'vaponephrine.' It helps relax the muscles in the airway, which helps the child breathe. It is only given in a doctor's office, emergency room, or hospital. It works quickly, but may not last as long as a steroid. Therefore, a steroid is given along with this., Your child may require medical attention to help them recover from croup, but other related issues could also require medical assistance. Dehydration is a serious risk with croup, as it can make swallowing uncomfortable. Severe dehydration can limit your child’s ability to recover and create other health issues. Keep a look out for signs that your child is becoming dehydrated. If your child exhibits any of the following symptoms, seek medical attention:If your child has been going to the bathroom less frequently than usual, that is often a sign of dehydration. The color of your child’s urine will grow darker the more dehydrated they are. Most babies should urinate at least 6 times a day, and older children should urinate at least 3 times a day.  Dehydration can cause constipation, which can lead to abdominal cramping.  If the soft spot (or fontanel) on an infant’s head appears sunken, your infant may be severely dehydrated.  Rapid breathing and heartbeat are signs that your child is severely dehydrated.  Other symptoms include no tears while crying and a dry mouth.  It is uncommon for a child to require hospitalization for croup, but it’s important that you are aware of the symptoms that may indicate that your child needs immediate medical care. Seek medical treatment if your child displays any of the following symptoms:Breathing becomes extremely labored or difficult  The child begins to drool or has difficulty swallowing, or the child has noisy breathing (called stridor) even when resting  Skin around the nose or mouth turns blueish or grey  Fever reaches 104 degrees Fahrenheit  The child is difficult to arouse or is very irritable.  In extreme cases, it is sometimes necessary to insert a breathing tube in your child’s windpipe to help ensure they are able to breath until they begin to recover. This will require hospitalizing your child.This is usually used as a last resort and is fairly uncommon.  Breathing tubes are often used in conjunction with IV fluids to keep your child well hydrated.  ","have your doctor prescribe a steroid. ask a doctor to administer epinephrine. look for signs of dehydration. recognize symptoms that indicate an emergency. have a breathing tube inserted. "

"As you prepare the jars for canning, you should get your canner ready. Fill the canner with enough water to completely submerse the jars in. Position a jar rack inside the bottom of the canner to prevent the jars from sliding around.  If you do not have a boiling-water canner, you can use a large, heavy stockpot instead. Make sure you still place something at the bottom of the stockpot to prevent the jars from moving around later on, though.  Mix the two seasonings together evenly in a small dish.  Spread equal amounts of the seed mixture into each pint-size (500 ml) jar until all of the mixture has been used.  Use a wide-mouth funnel, if available, to make it easier to pack the peppers into each jar as you work.  Distribute equal amounts of the peppers into each jar using a large serving spoon or measuring cup. Leave 1 inch (2.5 cm) of empty headspace in between the peppers and the top of each jar.  Once the salt is dissolved and the solution has reached a boil, remove it from the heat.  Use a ladle to pour the vinegar brine into the jars, covering the peppers completely and filling in any air pockets further down inside the jar. Leave 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) empty headspace.  If anything got onto the rims of the jars as you worked, it is important to clean it off with a clean, damp cloth. Excess seasoning or brine could actually interfere with the lids and prevent them from sealing correctly.  Two-piece metal canning lids work best. Screw the lids onto the jars, stopping once you feel resistance. Do not tighten the lids too much, since doing so can cause damage to the jars.  Carefully lower the jars into the boiling water inside the canner using jar tongs. Do not allow them to bump as you move them, and do not allow them to touch once they are sitting in the canner. The amount of time you need to process them for will vary depending on your altitude.At 1000 ft (304.8 m) or below, process the jars for 10 minutes.  Between 1,000 feet (304.8 m) and 6000 ft (304.8 m to 1.83 km), process the jars for 15 minutes.  Above 6000 ft (1.83 km), process the jars for 20 minutes.  Use jar tongs to carefully remove the jars of jalapeno slices. Let them cool in a draft-free spot for 12 to 24 hours.  If the center button on the lids pop up and down, the lids have not sealed and the peppers are not safe for long-term storage. If the button does not move, however, the lids have sealed correctly.  A kitchen cabinet or pantry works well. Shake the jars to disperse the seasonings evenly before serving.  ","boil water inside a boiling-water canner. combine the mustard seed and celery seed. distribute the seed mixture into the jars. place a funnel in the top of each jar. transfer the pepper rings into each jar. boil the vinegar, canning salt, and purified water.combine the three ingredients in a saucepan and heat them over high heat, stirring occasionally. ladle the brine solution over the jalapenos. wipe the rims of the jars clean. place the lids on the jars. process the jars in a boiling-water canner. remove and cool the jars. check the seals. store the peppers in a dry location.

"A will can be a pretty simple, straight forward legal document, but it is essential. If you don't have one, you will want to have one drawn up.You can do this yourself or hire a lawyer. Make sure to specify the beneficiaries of your possessions and any financial holdings you may have. If you have children, your will should clearly state the person who will become their legal guardian.Make sure to name an executor. This is the person who will make sure that your legal wishes are carried out.  If you are terminally ill, you will also want to create a living will. This will give a designated family member or friend the power to make legal decisions for you when you are no longer able.  Making plans can be calming and it may also help you deal with stress. Some people like to make the arrangements for the memorial service that will occur once they have passed away. You can make plans, and they can be as specific or general as you like.If you feel strongly about having either a religious or non-religious service, make sure to specify that. You can also make choices such as the type of music you would like to have playing during the service.  Make your plans clear to a loved one that you can trust. You can do much of the planning yourself, but you will need someone to actually oversee the process once you are gone.  You may find some comfort in saying farewell to your loved ones. This is a very personal matter, and one that will naturally be on your mind. Remember, there is no one right way to deal with dying. You can die with dignity by dealing with the process as you see fit.One way to say goodbye is by having a conversation. If you feel you will become distraught, you can plan in advance what you would like to say. Remember, tears and emotions are normal.  Some people choose to write letters to their loved ones as a final goodbye. These can be read before or after you have passed.  ","make a will. plan your memorial. say your goodbyes. "

"Have faith in yourself. You might feel as if your life won't get any better, but know that you live in a time where you can actually be helped. You have the chance to become who you are supposed to be. Remember that there are plenty of people who went through similar experiences to what you are going through. You are not alone and you are definitely not weird. There are plenty of transgender people out there living happy and healthy lives.;  , Expressing yourself in any way you want can help you cope with the situation. It could be drawing, writing, painting, or even running. Find whatever ways that can help you deal with your dysphoria. It's important to let all of your internal feelings out so you can let go of these negative emotions. These negative emotions can really hurt you in a mental and physical way. Some people try to repress their emotions and they are likely to become passive-aggressive or very unhappy. You might feel like you are broken or as if there is something wrong with you. These negative emotions can physically harm you and you could develop diseases due to stress or depression. It can be anything.  Relax. Breathe in and out when you feel as if your worries might overwhelm you. Being balanced can help you dealing with your emotions. Meditation and yoga are ways of developing this ability to relax.  Do research on transgender people and gender dysphoria. There are plenty of videos on YouTube on gender dysphoria. Transgender people have an inherent feeling that there is something wrong with their assigned sex. Just because you might be a boy who feels more comfortable dressing like a girl, doesn't mean you instantly are transgender. You might be non-binary, having a gender identity that doesn't adhere to the gender binary, and be experiencing dysphoria. It can still be difficult, since society has a hard time dealing with anyone who doesn't fit the box. Understand that it is totally okay the way you are feeling and that you are a wonderful human being no matter what.  Everyone comes in many different shapes and sizes. Everyone has their own ways of expressing who they are (walk, dress, voice pitch. etc). Embrace your uniqueness. Don't let society define who you are, it is up to you to define who you are.  Do not listen to people who try to say your gender dysphoria is like BDD or it's 'nothing'. Your dysphoria is a piece of who you are, which happens to be uncomfortable with your assigned sex. It's the need to be comfortable in your own body and to be happy.  It can help a lot if you know someone that you can trust to listening to you and understands what you are feeling and what you are going through. It can be a real relief to be able to express yourself and talk to someone freely. The feeling that you are being listened to and understood is important. You can look up forums for trans people and connect to others online. Your could use Skype or any other social media to talk to people like you. There are people who are in the same situation that you are in right now. You might be surprise by the amount of people that are looking for others to talk to about their dysphoria.  Talk to yourself (literally). It doesn't make you crazy. Many people talk to themselves, because it is a way to release the emotion you are bottling up inside. Some people have compared talking to yourself to crying. These are methods of releasing sadness or stress.  These include binders, packers, and breast forms. You can tuck as well.  While you cannot wear these items 24/7, it can help you with dysphoria in public or other short-term situations.

"In order to qualify for a reverse mortgage, you’re going to have to meet a couple basic requirements, you must be over sixty-two years of age and have sufficient equity in your home.Most people won’t get a reverse mortgage until their home is completely paid off, but you may still be eligible even you are still making payments. But if you’re still making payments, the balance must be completely paid off with the reverse mortgage.  For example, if you have a balance on your mortgage of $10,000 and you’re eligible for a reverse mortgage of $100,000, you would have $90,000 left over after you paid off your mortgage. Use a reverse mortgage calculator to estimate how much you qualify for. You can find one at http://www.reversemortgage.org/About/Reverse-Mortgage-Calculator.;  , Not every house will qualify for a reverse mortgage. To be eligible for a reverse mortgage, a home must generally be a single family dwelling.  Under certain circumstances, multi-family structures may qualify. If you live in a structure with four units or fewer and occupy one of the units as your primary dwelling, you should be eligible for a reverse mortgage.  Even if you want to get a reverse mortgage on a single family home, you must also show it is your primary residence. You will need to show you reside in your home at least 183 days out of the year, and each year after you receive your loan, you will need to sign an Annual Occupancy Certificate. , One of the conditions of obtaining a reverse mortgage is the completion of a loan counseling session. The lender cannot recommend a specific counselor, but is required to give you a HUD approved list of counselors in your area. A lender cannot give you a reverse mortgage unless you have a valid HECM Counseling Certificate.A counseling session should take about an hour and a half (or longer if you need more time), and can be completed over the phone or done in person. They usually cost between $100 and $200, although some organizations offer it free of charge.  The counselors should explain the terms and conditions of a reverse mortgage to you, paying attention to the advantages and drawbacks unique to your situation. They should also conduct some preliminary calculations determining whether you could afford a reverse mortgage when taxes, insurance, repairs and the like are included.  Different types of reverse mortgages have different costs associated with them, and when you complete the counseling session, the counselor is legally required to provide you with the Total Annual Loan Cost (TALC). That way you can make a side by side comparison and decide which one is best for you.  You might want to choose someone you have worked with in the past on financing, or a professional who is highly reputable and comes recommended.It’s best if your lender is a member of the National Reverse Mortgage Lenders Association (NRMLA) . Members must meet certain operational and ethical standards, including keeping up to date with current law and best practices through continuing education programs. You can find an NRMLA member at http://www.reversemortgage.org/Find-a-Lender.  You may also be able to find a broker that works with an NRMLA lender who could get you a better deal.  The application process for getting a reverse mortgage is similar to getting a conventional mortgage. The lender will investigate your financial situation and evaluate whether they think you can afford the costs associated with a reverse mortgage. Be prepared to provide:Any records of your income, including wages, salaries, pensions, retirement accounts, SSI, Social Security, and any other income you may have.  Records of your expenses, such as utilities, insurance payments, any debts (including mortgages), and taxes.  You should also be prepared for an inquiry into your credit history. If there are any lingering negative items on your credit report, it would be best to talk to your old creditors and resolve them.  This can sometimes take up to 30 days. The lender will conduct a title search and check for liens or other issues that might challenge your ownership of the house. Once you’ve secured approval, you should choose how you want your payout. Your reverse mortgage loan can be structured in a variety of ways:The loan can be structured as a line of credit. The borrower can access the line of credit at any time for whatever reason, although there may be limits on how much can be accessed in a time period. The unused balance of the line of credit actually grows in value as the home increases in value.  The loan can be structured as a monthly payment for a fixed number of years, known as a term payment plan. The buyer receives the same amount of money each month even if the value of the home decreases.  The loan can be structured under a tenured payment plan, which means that the buyer gets a monthly payment for as long as they remain in the home, even if the amount of payments exceed the loan value.  When a loan is 'clear to close,' underwriting and financials are complete and your application has been approved. Once you’ve decided to close with a lender, speak with a real estate attorney in preparation for the closing.Your attorney should make sure the interest rate, loan amount, fees and terms of repayment are what you and the lender previously agreed to. In addition, they should review the contract for any terms which might be to your disadvantage.  The closing costs and assorted fees are usually between $1200 and $2800, not including origination fees. Origination fees are 2% of the first $200,000 and 1% thereafter, with a cap of $6,000 total. These costs can usually be folded into the mortgage, but you should be aware of them. , If everything is satisfactory, go ahead and sign the paperwork. Most lenders will cut you a check immediately or send it to you by overnight mail. If part of the reverse mortgage will be going to pay off your existing mortgage, the lender should get a check to them immediately as well.If you think one of the other payment plans may be more advantageous to you, you are entitled to change it for whatever reason.  Since the upfront costs of a reverse mortgage can be so high, it doesn’t make sense to get one if you’re going to leave the house in a few years. If you are, it’s probably better to get a conventional home equity loan, or second mortgage.If you’re having trouble paying your taxes, see if your county has property tax deferral programs. If you need the money to make repairs, a HELOC, or home equity line of credit, is almost certainly a better option for you.  Getting a reverse mortgage won’t impact your Social Security retirement or your Medicare benefits, but you’ll probably lose your Medicaid and SSI if you take a reverse mortgage. If you have more than $3,000 in liquid assets, it automatically removes you from Medicaid eligibility. Once the money’s spent, you can reapply, but it does pose a problem for certain retirees.  A reverse mortgage literally does act as if it is reversing your original mortgage. Your equity is paid back to you on a monthly basis, creating a balance on the mortgage.When the homeowner dies, the title to the house can pass onto their heirs, but the heirs have to satisfy the amount of the loan or forfeit the deed.  ","make sure you meet the special requirements. decide if your house meets the requirements. demonstrate that the home is your primary residence. attend a counseling session. find a lender who you trust to manage your reverse mortgage. fill out the application. wait for approval and choose the format of the loan. schedule a closing date with your lender once the loan is 'clear to close.', sign the paperwork and wait for your check. don’t take out a reverse mortgage if you plan on leaving the home soon. consider the impact on medicaid or ssi benefits. look for other options if you want to pass the home onto your heirs. "
"You need to know the skill level of the least experienced member of your group. This person determines how hard you can push everyone and the type of terrain and length of the skiing trip that you can propose. As with a hike, the slowest and least capable person determines the group's entire pace and if there is a skier incapable of skiing certain terrain, this can become a liability if not accounted for at the outset. Determining basic expertise level will ensure that the trip is safe and enjoyable for all.  It is okay to include a challenge for members willing to undertake to push themselves that bit further. However, you all need to know and recognize that this is what is intended and still make allowances for it.;  , Be prepared to put in decent effort and time in finding an appropriate location. The location should not only match the abilities of all group members but should be a place that provides everyone with a chance to enjoy the great outdoors, learn something new and even push themselves a little.  Contact local outfitting companies for information regarding avalanche risks during particular times of the year. They should also be able to provide guidance as to weather trends and regional affordability.  Those who have never gone skiing in the backcountry should consider taking a community class to ensure safety. This will enable them to learn rescue actions, understand what to do when you get lost and coping with dangers such as avalanches. If you don't have access to a class, arrange a night or a few nights for learning from the more advanced members of the group. Use YouTube videos to demonstrate dangers and rescue techniques, as well as physically practicing some of these techniques.  Backcountry skiing training and safety classes are often offered at local universities and even some outdoor recreation stores. These classes can be taken for a reasonable fee, although the purchase of some safety tools may be required.  Be sure to leave a note with a trusted friend or family member regarding the location of the ski trip, the estimated length of the vacation and the time the participants are expected to return home. This information can be essential for rapid outdoor rescue in the event of an emergency.  You have the option of your own transport or catching public transportation, depending on what is available. Some things to consider include:  If you are driving, is your car roadworthy for snow and ice? Do you have snow tires and/or chains? Is the car in good condition?  Is there a need for more than one car? Would it make sense to hire a bigger vehicle and share the costs around?  If you are taking public transportation, what will you need to do about getting to any out-of-the-way locations once you arrive at the main town or location near that area?  , You'll need room for the ski gear, any food/drink, changes of clothing and, of course, the passengers.  Presuming you arrive at a nearby town to begin with, a motel is probably a good start. As a group, you might be able to get a group discount at a nearby motel but equally, since you are a group, you will probably need to book ahead to ensure that you all get a place.  When you're actually skiing backcountry, if your trip is more than the day, you'll need overnight shelter. Find out what huts are in the area you're skiing and how to book them or use them. This will also affect your route planning, as clearly you'll need to factor in the location of huts if using them.  Tents are a possibility if the conditions are right and all members of the group know how to winter camp. This can be tough on everyone and there are risks, such as avalanches and severe cold, so each member must be aware of what to do to create a safe camp.  Snow caves are an option but are very tiring to build. They are best kept for an emergency.  At least two members of the group, and preferably all members of the group, should know how to map read and find their way with a compass. GPS might not work where you are going.  Does the map show skiing routes at all? These are handy to make use of.  Look online for suggestions from others who have already skied the area. Learn from their experiences to guide your own. In particular, find out about potential hazards and how to avoid these.  Contact the local parks office or tourist office to find out more information.  Once you have the map and background information that you need, plan a route that is doable by all members of the group. Factor in everyone's skill, the time it normally takes and add a little extra time for safety.  Are there any features you want to see while on the trip, such as a photography opportunity? Include these in the route planning.  Do not plan to push on after dark; while headlamps can show some of the way, this is dangerous and it is the time for resting and regaining your energy.  Include high fat content food, such as chocolate, energy bars, jerky and nuts. Carry a small stove suitable for winter cooking to allow you to heat up meals for lunch and dinner; the camping package meals are ideal.  Water bottles should be insulated to prevent the water from freezing. You do need to drink often when skiing, even if it doesn't feel like it.  This will help you to plan what food to carry.  If someone is able to carry more due to greater strength, that is fine but it is important that everyone has some form of food on them, just in case they get separated.  If you don't already know what to wear, a reputable sports store that outfits skiers will be able to advise you. For a long trip, changes of clothing will be required but even for a day trip, a spare pair of socks and extra gloves can't hurt to carry.  These areas will be your Achilles heel if not properly covered while skiing. Balaclavas are a good choice for the head, as they cover both face and head and there are many modern fabrics and designs to choose from.  Many skiers choose to layer gloves and mittens for optimal warmth.  Helmet wearing is dependent on the speed and type of skiing the group will be doing. Discuss this with your group ahead of the trip.  ","determine the skiing ability of all members who intend to form a part of the group. choose a travel destination. find an area that is picturesque, safe and affordable. brush up on backcountry skiing familiarity. have a safety plan in place. decide how you're all getting to the location. ensure that the transport you choose has sufficient space. consider where you'll stay on arrival. check out huts. consider winter camping. get a decent map of the area before all else. plan the route. plan to pack energy food and water. if staying in a hut, find out in advance what cooking facilities it has. spread the weight of food and water evenly between group members' packs. wear appropriate clothing for skiing in cold conditions. have adequate head, face and hand protection.

"You'll want to make sure you have everything you need before you begin. In addition to the actual building materials, you'll also need several tools, including a power drill, a router, measuring tape, screws, hinges, and one or two hook-and-eye latches for the enclosure's opening.Wood is the primary structural material. You'll be using it to assemble most of the enclosure.  High-pressure particleboard with a laminate coating, pre-built shelving, or high-quality plywood are all ideal types of wood for the enclosure.  Be sure you stain the wood before beginning.  You'll also need to choose between glass or thermoplastic for the panels of your enclosure. Glass and plastic both help retain heat inside the enclosure, though plastic may be more effective.;  , Before you measure and cut any pieces, you'll need to decide how large your enclosure should be. This will be determined by the size of your snake. If your snake is still growing, size your enclosure to its estimated adult size, which a breeder or snake expert at your local pet store should be able to tell you.  Generally speaking, most snakes need at least enough space to stretch out across the cage.Smaller sized snakes like garter and grass snakes can be kept in smaller enclosures, so long as they have enough room.Medium- to large-sized snakes, including king snakes, rat snakes, milk snakes, and gopher snakes, require larger enclosures.  Be aware that climbing snakes will do better in a taller enclosure, while burrowing snakes will do better in a longer enclosure.  Generally speaking, if your snake is venomous or is capable of moving particularly fast, it's best to put the opening on top of the enclosure. This will help prevent escape attempts while the enclosure is open for feeding or cleaning. If your snake is not venomous and does not move quickly, you can put the opening on the side of the enclosure. Having a side-opening enclosure allows you to stack your snake's habitat between other enclosures (if you have more than one). You will not have this option if you put the opening on the top of the enclosure.  If your snake will need an artificial heat source, it may be easiest to put the opening on top of the enclosure. If you're using a glass panel, you may be able to simply place the heat lamp directly on the glass.  Before you can actually build the enclosure, you'll need to measure its components. It's important to be as precise as possible with your measurements since a gap in the enclosure could make it easy for your snake to escape.  Smaller snakes can be kept in a 10- or 20-gallon tank.This measures out to either 20 inches by 10 inches by 12 inches (51 by 25 by 30.5 centimeters), or up to 24 inches by 12 inches by 16 inches (61 by 30.5 by 40.5 centimeters)Medium-to-large sized snakes typically need between 30- and 55-gallon tanks. This measures out to 36 inches by 12 inches by 16 inches (91.5 by 30.5 by 40.5 centimeters) or up to 48 inches by 13 inches by 20 inches (122 by 33 by 51 centimeters).  The glass or plastic panel you use as a window for the front of the enclosure should measure a few tenths of an inch (less than a centimeter) shorter than the back wooden panel. This will allow a more precise fit in the grooves that you'll dig out.  Over time, the wood in your enclosure may begin to rot. It will also get dirty and may be difficult to clean if you do not stain the wood first. Staining will help protect the wood to ensure a longer life for your enclosure., Once you've assessed the size needs of your snake and determined the final dimensions, you'll be ready to cut your wood. It can be helpful to mark the sizes in chalk or pencil before cutting so that you have precise measurements and straight lines to cut along.  Make sure you wear personal protective equipment (PPE) while working with wood. This includes safety glasses, gloves, earplugs, a respirator, and a padded kickback apron.Cut each piece as a solid rectangle. You only need to cut the sides, back, top, and bottom.  The front face will be a glass or plastic panel held in place by the top, bottom, and sides.  Before you can complete the enclosure's assembly, you'll need to make room for the glass or plastic panel and insert it into place. This will be done using a router to gouge out the wood.Dig the groove 0.5 inches (1.25 centimeters) from the face of what will be the outside wall of the enclosure.  You'll need to cut grooves in the front face of the top and bottom pieces as well as down the sides.  Slide the glass or plastic panel into each groove to ensure that it fits snugly in place.  Use a power drill to bore holes in the sides, back, and bottom of the enclosure, then screw them into place. If your cage will open from the side, attach the back, bottom, top, and one side of the panel, leaving the opening side unattached.Make sure the grooves for the glass or plastic panel line up evenly.  Before you attach the top, slide the glass or plastic panel into place so that your enclosure is complete. If you are making a side-opening enclosure, wait before attaching your chosen side's panel.  Make sure there are no gaps around the glass or plastic panel.  Use an adhesive that's approved for use around pets to seal up any gaps where the panel fits into your wooden frame. You can find these products at your local hardware store or through an online retailer.  If you're building an enclosure that opens from the top, then you'll be attaching the top panel with hinges. If your enclosure opens from the side, then your chosen side's panel will be the opening that you affix with hinges.Measure where you will need to attach the hinges onto the opening panel (either the top or one side). Then measure where the hinges will attach to the back panel.  Use a power drill to bore holes for the hinges, then screw the hinges into place.  Attach hook-and-eye latches to each corner of the opening panel. It's typically a good idea to use multiple latches instead of just one since some snakes are strong enough to break through weak doors.  Drill several small holes for ventilation in the opening panel (either the top or the side of your enclosure).  Your snake will feel most comfortable if there is some type of substrate at the bottom of the enclosure. The materials you use, though, will depend on your snake and its traditional habitat in the wild.  Snakes that naturally live in the desert will need fine-grain sand for a substrate.For other snakes, unprinted paper (such as unprinted newspaper pages or butcher's paper) can be laid down in shredded layers.  Still other snakes will prefer clean leaf litter as a substrate.Talk to a veterinarian or a snake expert at your local pet store to determine what type of substrate would work best for your snake.  Most snakes like some type of vegetative cover since they're typically used to having this in the wild. Different snake species are used to different habitats, and the types of plants you provide should reflect what your snake would live with in nature. However, once you've identified the best type of vegetation, you will need to choose between live plants and artificial plants.Chinese evergreen, ferns, small palms, philodendron, bromeliads, and begonias are all plants that are commonly used in snake enclosures.  Live plants can be difficult to maintain and frequently carry pests or diseases. For this reason, many experts advise against using live plants and advocate for artificial plants instead., All snakes need a constant supply of fresh drinking water. Snakes will need food as well. All snakes are predatory carnivores, which means that your snake will need live, frozen, or recently-killed organisms in order to survive.  Try to provide a water dish that is large enough for your snake to immerse itself in.Be sure the water dish you purchase is heavy enough that it will not get tipped over as your snake climbs in or out.  The food you feed your snake will depend on the diet of that species. Most pet snake species eat mice, rats, gerbils, or hamsters, though smaller snakes may eat insects, frogs, or amphibians.Ask your veterinarian or a snake expert at your local pet store about what type of diet is best for your snake.  Once you've got everything set up, you'll be ready to introduce your pet snake to its new home. Give your snake time to adjust to its new surroundings before you attempt to handle the snake or remove it from the enclosure, as it may be frightened or confused after being transferred to its new home.

"The TWIC (Transportation Worker Identification Credential) is a certification administered in the United States by the Transportation Security Administration. In order to work on a dock, you first have to obtain this certification. To get a TWIC card, schedule an appointment with the TSA and bring all of your identifying documents to the appointment. You will have to fill out a questionnaire and pay a fee, after which you will be approved and receive your card.;  , Along the west coast of the U.S., this is likely to be the ILWU (International Longshore and Warehouse Union), while the prominent union along the east coast is the ILA (International Longshoreman's Association).  Dock work is peculiar in that no longshoreman is required (or even able) to work a fixed schedule. Each day, the amount of labor hours needed based on the dock traffic expected is transmitted to the union's hiring hall. Longshoreman seeking work that day arrive at the hiring hall, and the available work is assigned by seniority.  Your career as a longshoreman begins as a 'casual worker.' Casual workers are those who are not members of the union, and therefore get picked last when work is being assigned. This leads to a very unreliable and erratic work schedule, where weeks can pass between available shifts.  If there is a shortage of work available, the hiring hall can advise you not to attempt to work that day, as all available shifts will be taken by union members.  If there is a prospect of casual labor being assigned on a given day, arrive at the hiring hall at the designated time. You will generally have to wait in a line as work is being assigned, with no guarantee that there will be a shift available for you.  If you remain persistent in seeking casual dock work, you will eventually be recognized by the union as an identified casual and given an ID card. This does not make you a union member, so you will still be behind union members in seniority. However, you are now given preference over non-ID casuals when work is assigned.  Once you are an identified casual, you can apply for membership in the union. The union will distribute applications when they are seeking to expand their membership, and the process is generally very competitive. You may have to apply several times before being accepted. Once accepted into the union, your schedule will become more reliable, as you are now given preference over casual workers. Union members are full-fledged longshoremen and receive benefits from the union.  ","obtain a twic card. determine which labor union employs the longshoremen at your local port. determine the location and hours of the union's hiring hall. start your search for work by calling the hiring hall each day. show up to the union hiring hall when there are many shifts available. gain enough experience to achieve 'identified casual' status. apply for union membership.

"When you see your crush, grab his gaze and hold it. Smile at him. Hold that look for a few seconds and then look away. Repeat it again and if he’s interested he’ll mirror your cues.  Use the flick technique: Meet his eyes, let your gaze fall to his mouth, and then lift them so that your eyes meet his again. Pair that with a coy grin.When you know he’s watching you, play with your hair a little. This lets him know that you notice him noticing you.;  , Fake it till you make it. The more you allow yourself to relax into the situation and feel comfortable with it, the more confident you will seem. Confidence is an aphrodisiac for men so use it generously.  Don’t fidget with or hide your hands as its often a sign of nervousness. Place them on your hips or leave them out in the open to promote better posture and signal to him that you are open.  Keep your chin up and eyes level at all times, even as you walk to project confidence.  Take care of your appearance. Groom with products that leave you smelling good and feeling good: like conditioners, lotions, fragrances, etc. Pay attention to the details.  He’ll remember you from your back and forth looks. Comment offhandedly about something in class or make a joke. This takes the pressure off an initial one-on-one encounter and can feel a lot more organic than the individual approach attempt.  If you’re feeling brave, approach him directly. If not, make approaching him more comfortable by setting the scene. The setup will provide the icebreaker you need to get the conversation going.  Bump into him and apologize frantically. Place your hand in your hair and laugh at yourself for running into him.  Drop something, like a book or a pen, as you walk past him. He will either run after you to return it to you or you can retrieve it yourself and explain that you are clumsy.  This will always be the boldest move because it’s direct, straightforward, and lacks the presence of games. The simplest thing to say is: “Hi, I’m Ashley, what’s your name?”If in-person introductions intimidate you, create an indirect approach to introducing yourself.  Add him on Facebook or Instagram. Message him directly by giving your name and telling him where he might know you from (school or work). Tell him you have noticed him from afar and have been dying to talk to him and let him know your name.  Direct message him on Twitter introducing yourself as his classmate or coworker Ashley. Use your shyness to your advantage by saying that he makes you so shy in person that Twitter messaging became the next best thing to hello.  Get his number from a mutual friend. This one is a little risky because a lot of people do not like to have their numbers handed out if it is not from them directly, but if you make up a good excuse, you might be able to make this move work in your favor. Apologize for having his number and tell him that you missed notes in class, heard he would have them, and really need it to study for an upcoming test. This looks more proactive, less crazy, so if you’re going to text him, make sure you have a reason and take the conversation from there.  Light topics will always be easier to expound upon into deeper topics later. Ask about the weather or ask if he went to the school’s last game. Ask him how he’s doing today or what he’s up to.  ”What kind of day are you having?”  ”What are you studying?”  ”Where do you work?”  ”What are you doing later?”  , Ask questions that are open-ended and lead to him describing his likes and dislikes, his passions, and his interests. Listen to his responses more than you speak. ”What kind of movies do you like? What are your favorites?”  ”What do you like to read in your spare time?”  ”What is the most beautiful place you’ve ever been?”  ”Where do you plan to travel to this year?”  ”What’s one thing that you’re really, really good at?”  , Men like praise and appreciation as much as women do. The act itself puts into words your interest in him. Slip into the conversation organically and limit the compliments to a couple at a time.If he smiles while you’re talking: “You have an incredible smile.”  If he laughs at something funny: “Your laugh is music.”  If he has a great sense of humor: “You are really funny.”  If you like what he’s wearing: “You have really great style.”  If you want to mention his looks but not directly, wait for him to do something that’s cute, like talking about a hobby passionately: “You’re so cute.”  , Make things feel less formal and less like an interview by making conversation a two-way street. If he asks questions about you because he’s interested and wants to know more, answer honestly and confidently.  Connect a shared passion or interest with a personal story to deepen the emotional connection between you two.  Allow him to get to know who you are and decide if he likes what he likes.  Stare in his eyes intensely. Use body language to show him your interest. Touch him lightly on the arm or accidentally touch his leg, knees, or feet with yours.  Now that momentum has been made with creating a foundation for friendship, see if there’s more there by hanging out one-on-one in a more intimate setting. Connection continues to build the more you bond through shared activities.Grab a bite to eat somewhere just the two of you.  Find a less pressured date setting by going hiking or doing something active like racquetball.  Consider volunteering together to build houses or feed the hungry.  ","send cues of interest. be confident. approach him with his group of friends. create an opportunity. introduce yourself. make small talk. get acquainted with his interests. give him a compliment. volunteer personal things about yourself. flirt with him. suggest that you two hang out.

"Baking soda is a great way to remove bad odors and build up in your kitchen drain. It is a great way to clean out the drain.  White vinegar is also a great way to deodorize the kitchen drain. Pour white distilled vinegar into a pot and bring it to a boil.  Combining hot vinegar with baking soda will help to clean the drain and remove any bad smells. Carefully pour the hot vinegar down the drain. It may start to fizzle or foam as it mixes with the baking soda.  This will give the baking soda and the vinegar time to deodorize and clean the drain., Once the mixture has sat for one hour in the drain, use hot boiling water to flush the drain. This will remove any remaining scum or debris in the drain and rinse it out.  To prevent a smelly drain, you can deodorize it with baking soda and hot vinegar on a weekly basis.

"Mini skirts tend to have a hemline that falls out over the widest part of your thighs, accentuating this problem area. Look for hemlines that stop a couple of inches above or below your knee to balance out your legs.  If your legs are full from top to bottom, a mini skirt may help elongate your leg by showing off more skin. An elongated leg also means a slenderized leg.  Women who carry excess weight around their stomachs need longer hemlines to keep their body looking proportioned. Short hemlines will only draw further attention to a large midsection.  Try a mini skirt if you feel proud of your toned legs, or look for a fit-and-flare skirt with a hemline just below the knee if you want to make your muscular calves look slimmer.  Not many women can pull of the midi skirt because it lands at the thickest part of the calves, which generally makes your legs look stout. If you have slender calves, however, you can usually wear a midi without worry.  Baggy clothes do flatter plus sized women and tend to make them look dowdy. Instead of a long, baggy skirt, opt for a knee-length skirt with a little stretch and flare.  If your entire frame is thin, the excess fabric of a maxi skirt may threaten to swallow you up. If you do opt for a maxi skirt regardless, look for a sleek style that hugs your hips and thighs to reduce the amount of excess fabric.  ","stick with knee-length skirts if you have wider hips and thighs. try a mini skirt if you have full legs. avoid mini skirts if you have a full mid-section. show off your legs if you have an athletic build. wear a midi skirt if you have slender calves. resist the temptation to hide beneath a long skirt if you are a plus sized woman. stay away from long skirts if you are especially thin-boned.

"According to research, it may be somewhat safer to buy grass-fed and/or hormone free beef as opposed to commercially raised beef; the latter type of ground beef was about 20% more likely to contain multiple potentially harmful bacteria strains. However, the same testing revealed that 300 out of 300 packages of ground beef of all types contained at least one potentially harmful bacteria.No matter how it is raised, prepared, packaged, or stored, all beef contains bacteria, and some of it can potentially harm you. There is no such thing as bacteria-free beef, although most of the time the bacteria that is present is harmless.;  , Buy beef that is displayed in a cold setting and feels cold to the touch, and keep it that way until you are ready to cook it. Bring a cooler to store your purchased raw beef if you cannot refrigerate it within an hour or so of purchasing it.Bacteria of all types thrive in temperatures ranging between 40 and 140 degrees Fahrenheit (4-60 degrees Celsius). This range is known as the “danger zone,” and your beef, raw or cooked, should stay out of it as much as possible.  Don’t just pitch a package of raw meat into your shopping cart, on top of the cereal boxes and bag of apples. Bacteria from the meat may have made its way onto the wrapping during the packaging process, and any leaking juices can transmit bacteria.Place meat packages into individual plastic bags (such as the rolled produce bags found in supermarkets) before placing them into your cart. Wash or sanitize your hands after handling the package, if possible. Separate meat packages into their own bag(s) when checking out. Take extra care if you utilize reusable shopping bags — double bag your meat packages in plastic first.  Isolate raw meat in your home refrigerator as well. Place it in a sealed container on the bottom shelf of your fridge, where juices are less likely to drip onto other foods., The “sell by” date is just a recommendation made by the retailer; it makes no guarantee regarding safety or freshness. To reduce the risk of bacteria development, ground beef in particular should be used or frozen within two days of purchase; whole cuts can be kept for a couple days longer if necessary.Only high heat can kill bacteria; cold can only make them dormant, and the colder, the better. Set your refrigerator at 40 degrees Fahrenheit (4 C) or below, and your freezer at zero degrees F (-18 C)., During any stage of the process, and whether or not the meat is raw or cooked, you should limit as much as possible its time in the 40-140 degrees Fahrenheit (4-60 C) range. Keep it cold, or keep it hot — not in between.It is safest to thaw frozen beef in the refrigerator. If you need to thaw it faster, place it in a container of cold water in the sink, and change the water every half hour or so. Thawing in the microwave is another option. Do not just let frozen (or refrigerated) meat sit on the counter.Serve cooked beef while it is still hot, and refrigerate any leftovers before they get to room temperature. Never let beef sit out for more than two hours, and never more than one hour at between 90 and 140 degrees Fahrenheit (32-60 C) — this is the extreme danger zone within the “danger zone.”  , Other than thorough cooking, proper cleaning is your best defense against beef bacterial contamination. Immediately after handling raw meat, wash your hands for at least 20 seconds with warm water and soap. Turn on the faucet before handling the meat, or use your elbows instead of your contaminated hands.Wash any utensil or preparation surface that comes in contact with raw beef with soap and hot water. For example, don’t put raw burgers on a tray, cook them on the grill, then return them to the same tray without thoroughly cleaning it first.  Take special care with cutting boards. Whenever possible, dedicate a separate cutting board to meats. Wash the used board immediately, and consider sanitizing it with a solution of one teaspoon of bleach to one quart of hot water. Discard well-used, rutted cutting boards (or sand down wooden ones); ruts offer ample hiding places for bacteria., If you choose to have your steak rare or your burger deep pink and cool in the middle, you simply have to accept that you are increasing your risk of acquiring a bacterial illness. High temperatures are the surest — and really, only — way to kill bacteria in beef.Cook steaks, roasts, chops, etc. to an internal temperature (based on a probe placed into the center of the thickest part of the meat) of at least 145 degrees Fahrenheit (63 C). Let the meat rest for three minutes or more before serving.  Cook ground beef to an internal temperature of at least 160 degrees F (71 C). Bacteria tend to collect on the surface of meats, so ground beef is a greater risk (and thus requires a higher cooking temperature) because the grinding process spreads any surface bacteria throughout.Reheat any type of cooked, refrigerated beef to an internal temperature of 165 degrees F (74 C). Test several spots if using a microwave, since the heating can be quite uneven., Truth be told, you may well eat the majority of your beef outside of your home. As such, you have to rely on the safety measures taken by the food preparer. Whether eating at someone’s house, a restaurant, or a roadside stand, seek out clean locations that clearly prioritize food safety.Especially when dining abroad at a food cart or similar location, eat only meat that has been freshly cooked upon your order and is still hot throughout. Ensure that all plates and utensils are clean — use antibacterial wipes if necessary.  Simply put, all food contains bacteria. Not all bacteria is bad for you, and most of the time you won’t fall ill from the bacteria in your beef or any other food product. You can significantly reduce, but never completely eliminate, your chances of developing a foodborne illness caused by bacterial contamination.The bacteria found in the beef you buy at the store or restaurant can come from the animal source (the cow), production machinery, contamination during packaging, shipping, or display, or any number of other sources. You can’t see, smell, or taste bacterial contamination; beef doesn’t have to have “gone bad” or be rotten to make you sick.  Numerous bacteria can cause foodborne illnesses in humans; see a list of common culprits at this USDA webpage. In beef, the most common (but not only) contaminants include salmonella, e. coli, and listeria.If foodborne bacteria such as these make you sick, you will typically experience flu-like symptoms of varying severity. These can include vomiting, diarrhea (sometimes bloody), abdominal pain, fever, and chills. Symptoms can start a few hours to a couple of days after contamination, and can last for hours or several days.  For the vast majority of healthy adults and older children, a foodborne illness caused by contaminated beef is likely to be nothing more than a very unpleasant experience for a few days. However, people in higher-risk groups need to take greater precautions if a foodborne illness is suspected. And, even the healthiest of individuals needs to know when to contact the doctor when experiencing a lingering or severe foodborne illness.People at elevated risk for severe complications from foodborne illness include: infants and young children; pregnant women and their fetuses; the elderly; and those with weakened immune systems (due to illness, disease, medication, heredity, or another cause). Persons in these categories should contact a medical provider immediately if a foodborne illness is suspected.  No matter your age of level of overall health, contact your doctor if you experience any of the following: signs of dehydration; prolonged vomiting that prevents keeping liquids down; diarrhea for more than 2 days in adults or for more than 24 hours in children; severe pain in the abdomen or rectum; a fever higher than 101 degrees F (38 C); stools containing blood or pus; stools that are black and tarry; nervous system symptoms; signs of HUS (see this link for details).  ","know that your beef’s source may help, but is no guarantee. choose it cold, and keep it cold. isolate raw meat. use or freeze raw beef sooner rather than later. avoid the “danger zone” as much as possible. wash your hands and all preparation surfaces thoroughly. cook and reheat beef to the recommended temperatures. take precautions when eating out. accept that foodborne bacteria are everywhere. identify common signs of foodborne illness. know when to seek medical attention.

"Start with just a few numbers to get a feel for Italian. Pay attention to how the numbers are spelled, but focus on their pronunciation. Stressed (accented) syllables are in all caps:0 zero (TSEH-ro)  1 uno (OO-no)  2 due (DOO-eh)  3 tre (TREH)  4 quattro (KWAHT-tro)  5 cinque (CHEEN-kweh);  , Once you have the first few numbers down, you’re ready to learn up to ten. Make sure to pay attention to the number ten, which is the first to have three syllables (and the stress on the second).6 sei (SEH-ee)  7 sette (SET-teh)  8 otto (OHT-toh)  9 nove (NOH-veh)  10 dieci (dee-EH-chee)  , After you’ve mastered the first few numbers in Italian, you’ll have a good sense for how the language sounds. The numbers eleven through twenty are a bit longer, but you can see that parts of them will sound very similar to the numbers 1-10 (undici, or 'eleven,' for example, sounds a lot like uno plus dieci, or one plus ten).11 undici (OON-dee-chee)  12 dodici (DOH-dee-chee)  13 tredici (TREH-dee-chee)  14 quattordici (kwaht-TOR-dee-chee)  15 quindici (KWEEN-dee-chee)  16 sedici (SEH-dee-chee)  17 diciassette (dee-chahs-SET-teh)  18 diciotto (dee-CHOHT-toh)  19 diciannove (dee-chahn-NOH-veh)  20 venti (VEN-tee)  , Using the numbers as often as possible will help them stick in your memory. Regular practice will also help you feel more comfortable speaking Italian. Try a combination of techniques to use the numbers, such as:Making flashcards and quizzing yourself  Counting everyday objects, like coins or grapes  Using Italian numbers whenever you have to do mental math  Playing games, like Uno, that let you easily say the numbers in Italian.  Knowing how to say words correctly in Italian will make you sound more natural when speaking the language. Italian vowels are a distinctive part of the language’s sound, so make sure to pay attention to their correct pronunciation:a is pronounced like the first “a’ in “papa”  i usually sounds like the “ee” in “beet.” Occasionally, after some consonants, it will sound like a “y” as in “yet”  u is usually pronounced like the “oo” in “boot.” Sometimes (like after the letter g), u can sound like a “w”.  e is pronounced either like the “e” in “bet” (open form) or the “a” in “chaotic” (closed form)  o sounds close to either the vowel in “awe” (open form) or the “o” in “go”  , Most consonants in Italian are relatively close to their English equivalents. Beyond that, it’s mostly a matter of paying attention to a few guidelines and a couple of special cases:c and g can be either hard (before a, o, or u) or soft (before e or i). A hard c sounds like the “c” in “car.' A soft c sounds like the “ch” in “chase.” Say a hard g like the “g” in “go,” but a soft one like the beginning of “general.”  When there is an h after a c or g, the sound will be hard.  sc is pronounced like the “sh” in “ship.”  r in Italian is slightly trilled.  S is sometimes pronounced “ess” and sometimes like a “z.” Similarly, z can sound like an English “z” or like a “ts” sound, as in pizza.  The cluster gn sounds close to the “ny” in “canyon,” and gl is close to the middle sound in “million.”  Hold double consonants, such as in the middle of tutto, longer than you would in English.  If you're comfortable saying the numbers up to twenty in Italian, then a logical next step is to go even higher. To say “twenty-one,” “twenty-two,” and so on, you’ll follow a pattern that combines numbers very similar to the way that English does:21 ventuno (ven-TOO-noh)  22 ventidue (ven-tee-DOO-eh)  23 ventitré (ven-tee-TREH)  24 ventiquattro (ven-tee-KWAHT-troh)  25 venticinque (ven-tee-CHEEN-kweh)  26 ventisei (ven-tee-SEH-ee)  27 ventisette (ven-tee-SET-teh)  28 ventotto (ven-TOHT-toh)  29 ventinove (ven-tee-NOH-veh)  , Once you’ve have a sense of the basic pattern for how higher numbers are formed in Italian, you can start expanding your vocabulary. Try saying the tens up to one hundred:30 trenta (TREN-tah)  40 quaranta (kwah-RAHN-tah)  50 cinquanta (cheen-KWAHN-tah)  60 sessanta (ses-SAHN-tah)  70 settanta (set-TAHN-ta)  80 ottanta (oht-TAHN-ta)  90 novanta (noh-VAHN-tah)  100 cento (CHEN-toh)  , If you know someone who speaks Italian, ask them to let you practice with them! Start with a few greetings and introductions. For example, you might say:Hello - Ciao (CHOW)  My name is Melissa - Mi chiamo Melissa (ME kee-AH-mo Melissa)  What is your name? - Come ti chiami? (CO-may TEE kee-AH-mee)  Nice to meet you - Piacere di conoscerti (PYA-cheh-ray DEE ko-no-SHER-tee)  How are you? - Come stai? (CO-may STAH-ee)  I am fine - Sto bene (STO BEH-nay)  Goodbye - Ciao or Arrivederci (ah-REE-veh-dehr-chee)  , Once you’ve got some of the basics down, try picking up some everyday words and phrases. Audio and visual aids are fun ways to make progress. Try using apps like Duolingo, for instance. There are also podcasts, Youtube videos, and other media materials that can help you get used to the sound of the language.  ","learn the numbers up to five. follow up with six through ten. try eleven through twenty. practice the numbers. learn the sounds of italian vowels. practice pronouncing italian consonants. learn the numbers up to twenty-nine. learn some higher numbers. pick up some conversational phrases. use audio and visual aids to increase your vocabulary.

"There are a number of different possibilities, such as being naturally shy or feeling uncomfortable around certain people or situations. Discovering the cause of your quietness can help you find the right ways to work around that. Although you may want to become louder, understand that it's important to accept yourself as you are rather than attempting to completely change yourself. There is nothing wrong with being quiet, unless if you feel that it's hindering you from making relationships or discovering new experiences.;  , If you're naturally quiet, speaking up may appear frightening or unusual. You may be used to remaining silent and listening to others. However, tell yourself that if you talk to others, you'll be opening yourself to different opportunities. By stepping out and contributing with your ideas and topics, you can enjoy new experiences and improve your confidence in speaking. Focus on the positives rather than blowing the situation out of proportion and fretting over the bad things that might happen if you talk.  Practicing with your voice can boost your confidence in speaking, and it teaches you to enunciate your words correctly. It can also help you learn to speak louder and bolder. If you feel strange about reading out loud to yourself, you can take the time to read a story to your siblings or pets. Otherwise, find a private area where you can speak without others hearing you.  If they rarely come to your house, change that and allow them to visit you. If you're comfortable around your friends, you'll be more likely to feel better about talking to them, especially since you're in the comforts of your home. Practice talking with them and think about how confident or free you feel when you speak. The next time you talk to someone outside of your home, try to remember that confidence and hold onto the feeling.  Presenting in groups can help you feel more comfortable speaking authoritatively on a topic for a long period of time, even if you feel completely out of your depth. You will also develop the ability to respond to another person's opinion and disagree in a persuasive way. Because you're in a group, you won't have to be afraid of talking alone, as you'll have others to support your words and guide you. You will also be able to meet more people, develop your confidence, and improve your English vocabulary and style, as well as your grades if you attend school.  Scan the headlines of a national newspaper every morning and evening, or listen to the radio on your way to work or school. Quiet people often find it hard to come up with an icebreaker or feel out of depth in a conversation. Being knowledgeable about the world around you can help boost your confidence, as well as give you the ability to cover a variety of different subjects in a conversation. You'll also feel more bold and motivated when it comes to prompting a new topic. Don't be afraid to give your opinion, as it matters just as much as everyone else's. Quiet people often are very wise, valuing quality over quantity.  Although spending time with a group can be fun, it can also feel overwhelming, especially if there are many people chatting at the same time. If you find yourself being rendered mute, start small. As the chatty, self-assured folks vie for attention, talk to someone one-on-one rather than sitting off to the side. You will not only become more confident in approaching others but also learn to initiate interaction and include yourself. After a while, you can gradually branch out to other members of your group.  This will give you the motivation and boldness to start a conversation. Understand that quiet people are too often perceived as being snobbish or boring, which means people feel that they cannot reach out through their bubble. However, turning that bubble into an air of confidence can encourage others to initiate contact. Give people a friendly smile and a quick 'hello' to make you appear more approachable.  When speaking to someone, it's best to adapt a confident posture and appear engaged in the conversation. This will encourage them to continue speaking to you and can help you feel bolder. It will also make you approachable, command respect from those that speak to you, and make others interested in talking to you. If you slouch and often look away from people, this makes you appear uninterested in the conversation or unconfident, which can chase people away from you.  A balanced conversation between two people is a positive way to attract more people to you. Even if you're not the best talker, at least be a good listener and show the other person that you're interested in what they're saying. Learn good listening skills and show your compassionate side by being willing to listen to problems and offer solutions. However, you shouldn't be afraid to occasionally turn the focus on you or interject your opinion. If you feel that the other person is dominating the conversation, don't hesitate to speak up and politely tell them that you have something to say as well.  Despite the belief that having loud friends can help draw quiet people out of their shells, the truth is that they only give you the excuse to become mute. If they're too loud and rarely prompt you to speak, they'll only overshadow you and perhaps even push you back into the corner of the group. It's recommended that you befriend a healthy mixture of loud and quiet people so that you have a good balance. Someone who is quieter than you will force you to compensate for their silence and develop your ability to maintain a conversation. While opposites may attract, practice moderation.  Because you're surrounded by many people in your life, there are many different opportunities for a conversation with someone. Although you don't have to carry out a long talk, at least attempt to chat with someone for a short while, whether it's a stranger in a coffee shop or someone waiting in line with you. This will hone your conversation skills while decreasing the risk of embarrassment, as you'll never see the person again if you feel that you messed up the conversation. As you do this, understand that you'll be meeting a variety of different people. Some may be friendly and interested in talking with you while others may not be in the mood. Remember not to take their reactions personally, and realize that it's a learning experience for you.  Being naturally quiet often means that many people perceive it as being snobbish or elitist, which can be very hard to take. Swallow your pride and take a hard look at yourself in a social situation. Do your best to modify your appearance so that you appear friendly and approachable to other people. Stand up straight, smile, and make eye contact. Acknowledge people, even if you don't know them well. By making yourself approachable, you will make people like you and pique their interest in talking to you.  Understand that some conversations will be fantastic while others may fail. Remember that you're talking to different people with unique personalities. Some may be great conversationalists and perhaps cause you to feel inadequate and tongue tied. Others might refuse to hold their end of a conversation you're battling to get off the ground. No matter what the situation is, don't be afraid to take a step back. Avoid blaming yourself, as it's not always you that is the cause of the problem. You might not always get along well with some people, whether they're good or bad at talking. However, understand that you cannot use this as an excuse to be lazy. Work at initiating and carrying conversations, but if it turns out to be messy, accept your role as only part of it and move onto another. Take it as a learning experience rather than allowing it to discourage you.  As long as you view it in a good light, it will be a good personality trait. A quiet person is often respected and admired by chatty peers, and many people think of it as a sign of intelligence and wisdom. Work on being approachable, confident, and able to hold a conversation when the need arises, honing what you might now think is a hindrance into an attribute.  ","determine the reason why you remain quiet. encourage yourself. read out loud. invite your friends over. get involved in debating or public speaking. be informed of current events. start small in a large group. imagine yourself in a bubble of confidence. stand tall and make eye contact. be a good listener. befriend a mix of loud and quiet people. talk to one new person a day. appear approachable. don't always blame yourself. perceive quietness as a positive attribute.

"If the rabbit is not showing signs of improvement, then call the vet and tell them you are having an emergency issue with your rabbit. If your regular veterinarian is not available, for instance the problem is occurring on a day the veterinary office is closed, then you should call an emergency veterinary office in your area.  Your veterinary office may ask you some questions about your rabbit's condition. Then the person on the phone should help you assess whether the rabbit needs to be seen.  If you need to transport the rabbit to a vet, keep cooling it as you go. Wrap the rabbit in a damp towel and have the air conditioning on in the car.  Transporting a rabbit with heat stroke, while continuing to try to cool it down, may require two people. However, if you don't have anyone to help, just keep the temperature in the car cool and give the rabbit access to cool water.  Act calmly and quietly. Some rabbit's can really sense stress and react physically to being stressed themselves. They have sensitive systems, so whatever you can do to keep them calm will help.  Petting your rabbit softly and covering its eyes may help to keep it calm., In cases of extreme heat stroke, it is necessary to provide cool intravenous fluids. This will allow the veterinarian to bring the rabbit's core temperature down.This is the best, and usually the only, treatment a veterinarian can provide for heat stroke.  Getting these fluids can also help vital organs that have started to shut down as a result of dehydration.  ","get emergency veterinary treatment. keep the rabbit cool while in transport. avoid stressing the rabbit out further. understand that emergency veterinary treatment usually entails further cooling.

"Remove only enough as required by the connector, terminal, etc. for connection. A 'strip gauge' is often provided near the terminal of devices (switches, outlets, etc.) and should be checked before striping insulation. Additionally, the packaging of wirenuts and other connectors usually indicate how much insulation should be removed from a wire or cable. It is very important not to nick the wire in the insulation striping process. The size of the wire is critical, and a nick can create a hot spot whenever the circuit is loaded. This resulting spot expands and contracts with each heating and cooling cycle, and over time, effectively loosens the connection. Removing too much insulation increases the likelihood of accidental contact with something other than intended. Accidental contact can result in arc flashes, shock, burns and even loss of life.  Connectors, terminals, lugs, etc. have a rating for the type of wire material i.e.: copper (CU) or aluminum (AL) and copper clad - aluminum. The connector will bear either the 'CU' or 'AL' mark. A third mark, 'CU/AL' indicates the connector is suitable for either copper or aluminum. Never mix copper and aluminum conductors in a single terminal, unless it specifically designed for the mix.  These typically are a special design used to connect an aluminum and copper wire together so that a short copper jumper or pigtail may be connected to a CU rated terminal. These were common in the 70's when aluminum wiring was used to supply 15 & 20 amp circuits in residential and some commercial structures. It was learned that aluminum wire wasn't well suited for connection to the terminals on common outlets and switches.  Use of a copper jumper connected between the screw terminal of the switch or outlet and the building's aluminum wire via special connector solved this problem. Manufacture of aluminum wire for these purposes has ceased and now aluminum wire and cable is manufactured in larger sizes for connection to an electric range, service equipment and other high current uses. Terminal ratings are for wires made of either CU (copper only) or CU/AL (copper OR aluminum but not both at the same time).  Once the correct CU or AL terminal has been chosen, make sure the required temperature rating of the wire is met by the terminal. A wire or cable with a 90 degree Centigrade (or C) rating may have been installed to take advantage of the higher current carrying capacity or 'ampacity' rating provided over a similar cable with only a 75 or 60 degree rated cable insulation. All the terminals to which the wire will connect must meet the 90 degree C minimum rating as well, otherwise the ampacity of the wire will be reduced. This reduction may require a larger size wire or cable to replace the original. Cost of higher temperature terminals increase - while the availability goes down., Simply stated, unless indicated otherwise, only one wire is permitted to be terminated under a terminal (such as those on bus bars, switches, outlets, etc.), unless specifically designed to connect 2 or more (such as wirenuts, split bolts, etc.). Additionally, it is not permissible to split strands of wires or cable so that they may be terminated under more than one terminal or screw. The correct sized terminal for the wire or cable to be connected must be used., All of these prerequisites are for naught if insufficient pressure is applied. Use a torque wrench if need to obtain the proper pressure. Simple terminals on switches and outlets should be made tight - but if unsure, it is better that these be over tightened than under., Commercially available inhibitors are usually sold wherever aluminum wire is offered. The packaging explains how to prepare the wire and how to apply. Typically, a freshly stripped wire need not be 'wire brushed' unless it is oxidizing already. Oxidation of aluminum metals appears as a white or gray flaky or dusty residue on the surface. Clean with a wire bristle brush to remove the residue completely. Apply a liberal coating of oxide inhibitor over the entire surface of the exposed aluminum. Try to force it between the strands and the end of the wire. Do not leave so much inhibitor on the wire so that it will drip off. Remove enough excess inhibitor to prevent this from happening before inserting into the terminal., There is no need for a great deal of the conductor to hang out of a terminal. Any part of the stripped wire that is not touching the surface of the terminal, connector, etc. is doing nothing to help maintain conductivity of the circuit or its mechanical strength, and should be removed. Leaving just enough of the wire to be visible (up to 1/4 inch) out of any lug, terminal or split-bolt so as to allow the wire to be determined that it is connected very quickly. No stripped portion of conductors should be visible outside of wirenut type connectors. The non-conductive skirt at the open end of the wirenut provides insulation to any part of the conductor that may have been stripped slightly too much., Some connectors such a 'split bolts' and 'burndys' are uninsulated, and must be insulated to protect them from accidentally contacting other conductors and people. The general rule of thumb is to place at least the same amount of tape on these connectors as is on the wires and cables that enter them. Vinyl electrical tape is not very thick, so a thick rubber filler tape designed expressly for this application can save a great deal of time spent wrapping tape. Use the filler tape to provide 75% to 95% of the thickness of the wire's insulation on the connector and use the vinyl electrical tape to finish to 100% thickness. Make sure the tapes evenly cover the entire surface of all exposed metal of the connector and wires or cables., Larger cables usually only come in black jacketed insulation. It is important to identify these conductors with colored tape or paint depending on location. Painting is often done when exposed outdoors such as at a weather head for an electrical service, but tape is still very popular here too. In the U.S. use black, red, blue, identify line voltage cables, white for grounded neutrals and green for equipment grounds and bonds in 120 / 240 volt systems only. Use brown, orange and yellow for line voltage cables, gray for grounded neutral and green for equipment grounds and bonds in 480 / 277 volt systems only.  ","carefully remove insulation. use only connectors rated for the type wire. use correct terminal temperature ratings. use terminals rated for the size of the wire(s). torque all screws, terminals and lugs to specified rating. use an oxide inhibitor on aluminum wires and cables. trim any excess exposed wires as needed. replace insulation as needed. mark the conductors.

"Whether it be a sport, arts and crafts, drama, or whatever else it is that interests you, take the time to do this activity every day or week. This will ensure that you are taking some time out to relax and have fun. This has far-reaching good effects. You will be socializing, enjoying your favorite hobby, and feeling a sense of achievement, all of which help combat stress. It will also take your mind off the stress of school, even for just a few hours, which will give you an important stress-free time each day.  If you have a locker, put up one or two pictures on the door. Get a pencil case and school bag you really like and feel free to decorate them as you wish. Just little things like these may seem silly, but they really do help you to feel more relaxed and at home. They are a way of carving out your own personal space, mental and physical, at school, and having your own space is important in making the place less stressful.  It's easy to be stressed when you're hungry, so make sure to eat a good lunch, and snack throughout the day if you get hungry. In addition, while pizza and other junk food can taste good, it won't provide you with the nutrients you need to be happy and healthy throughout your day. Opt for a healthy lunch that will keep you going all day - you'll find that this helps reduce your stress levels and has positive effects on your life in general.  Eat lunch with friends in order to have fun, relax, and take your mind of the stressful aspects of school in the middle of each day. This can give you a much-needed break that will keep you going through the end of the day.  Give yourself little rewards now and then to encourage your hard work. Bring in a nice treat for your lunch, go out with your friends each weekend, have some alone time and read your favorite book or watch your favorite movie each night. Find some small things that you really like to do and do them at the end of each day or week.  When you get home from school, give yourself a half hour to an hour to just relax. You won't be able to learn anything if you're stressed and grumpy. Do some exercise, meditate, read a book, or go for a walk. This will clear your mind and get you nice and energized before you get started on that homework. When studying for long periods of time, take a 10 minute study break every hour to keep your mind and body focused and fresh throughout your study session.

"Your brain, like any other body part, improves with exercise. A great way to give your brain a workout is to test your recall. Throughout the day, see how many details of a given moment, list, or task you can remember.  Try to memorize small things each day. Write a grocery list and commit it to memory. Memorize a small passage from a poem or book. Wait an hour and see how much you can recall of what you've committed to memory.Draw a map from memory. Sketch a map going from your home to work, a store, a friend's house, or another place you frequently visit.Notice the little details. Making a conscious effort to notice seemingly irrelevant things can be a huge tool to help you become more logical. Do you notice the new paper cut on your friend's hand? Do you count the steps in your school or college? Do you look for spelling mistakes in texts? If the answer is no, now would be a great time to start. The more you practice, the healthier your mind will be. Over time, you'll become a more critical thinker.;  , The benefit of crossword puzzles on the mind is well documented. Crossword puzzles force you to push your brain slightly beyond its capabilities, which causes the regrowth of brain neurons. This increases your overall brain power and can promote more sound, logical thinking. Pick up a crossword puzzle book from a local bookstore or do your local newspaper's crossword each morning., Learning new abilities requires a lot of logical thinking. From devising strategies that help you learn to undertake challenging tasks, you use logic and strategy to acquire new skills. Try taking up some of the following activities to boost your logical thinking skills:Learn to play instruments.  Learn to draw or paint.  Learn to speak a foreign language.  Learn to cook.  Learning from others is a form of mental exercise. Social connections and friendships nourish the brain and push people to strive to better understand themselves and the world around them. Spend time with close friends and family members on a regular basis. Attend social events and take this as an opportunity to meet new people. This can be difficult if you're a shy or introverted person, but pushing yourself to take risks socially can actually improve your ability to think logically.

"If you are used to going to bed at midnight, you will certainly have trouble suddenly going to bed at 8 o’clock. Instead, try going to sleep at 11 o’clock, then 10 o’clock, and so on. It can take days or weeks to change your body’s natural rhythm. It’s important to begin adjusting your body a couple weeks before school starts.Give your body and mind plenty of time to adjust. Don’t start trying to adjust your sleep schedule two nights before school starts. You didn’t become a night owl overnight, so don’t expect to become a morning person overnight either! It takes time to reset your internal clock, so start a couple of weeks before the first day of school.;  , Different age groups have different sleep requirements. Children from 6 to 13 should be getting 9-11 hours of sleep nightly, while teenagers ages 14-17 need about 8-10 hours. Younger adults age 18-25 are recommended to receive about 7-9 hours., Exercising regularly is a great way to expend energy and ensure you sleep soundly at night. It can also help you fall asleep more quickly. Studies have shown that people who exercise at least 150 minutes a week also feel more alert and energized during their waking hours.Exercising late at night can energize you right before you need to be in bed. Try to work out in the mornings or early afternoons, and relax with more calming hobbies in the evening, such as reading.  Not only can caffeine make it harder for you to fall asleep, but it can also make your sleep disruptive and uneasy. By avoiding caffeine completely, you can get the deep, restorative sleep that will set you up for a successful day. If you don’t want to cut out caffeine completely, at least try to avoid it up to six hours before bedtime., This means everything- phones, tablets, televisions, etc. These devices shine light into your eyes, which has been scientifically proven to promote wakefulness. Just as the sunset signals the end of the day, your electronics should go lights out too. A dark bedroom tells your brain that it is time to sleep., There are also free apps on smart phones that can provide white noise- just make sure the bright screen is off! Your brain craves stimulation, and it can be hard to turn that desire off at night. A white noise machine provides that stimulation, in a gentle and calming way. It also masks any bothersome noises from outside your bedroom that can keep you awake.You can play around with different white noise options such as thunderstorm, campfire, rain forest, and more.  It is not easy to sleep if you are tossing and turning in a hot bedroom. As your body temperature lowers, your brain is told that it’s time to sleep. The best temperature for snoozing is anywhere from 60 to 68 degrees Fahrenheit. If you aren’t in control of the thermostat, a ceiling fan or a portable fan can do the trick. A fan can also provide calming white noise.  Just like you gradually scaled back your bedtime, you should do the same with your wake up time. Make it earlier in one hour increments gradually.  No matter how bad you want to hit snooze, don’t do it! It will only make waking up harder in the long run.  This signals to your brain that it is time to wake up, and will help shake your feelings of grogginess. Open your curtains, turn on your lights, or even step outside. The bright light will perk you up and also can benefit your overall mood., It’s a pretty simple chore, yet so many people skip it. Not only does it start your day with a feeling of accomplishment, but it is much harder to crawl back into a neatly made bed. Do this enough, and it’ll become a habit.  Your body can become dehydrated overnight, and this dehydration can increase your tiredness in the morning. By drinking a large glass of water first thing in the morning, you can restore some of the hydration you lost overnight and give yourself a quick, and easy, energy boost. Cold water can also increase adrenaline, which helps to wake you up., If you’re surrounded by silence, it’s easy (and appealing) to fall back asleep. You don’t need to play the peppiest music you can think of as loud as you possibly can. Just put on some music with upbeat melodies and positive lyrics, and it'll help you transition from zombie to human.Make a 'Rise & Shine' playlist on your phone to pop on during your early mornings.  If your blood sugar is low, your energy is low too. By eating a hearty meal in the morning, you are “breaking fast” and giving your body an energy boost in the morning.Try to eat healthy, nutrient-dense foods to promote stable energy levels. Sugary cereals and pastries may sound appealing, but they can cause a crash after the initial surge of energy., Get your body moving in the morning, however you can. If you have time to exercise in the morning, that’s great. If you don’t have time for a full workout, some gentle stretching can do the trick. By moving around and stretching out your body, you get your heart pumping and blood flowing to your brain.You may also get a burst of endorphins, the “feel good” chemicals that are released during physical exercise., It is normal to feel sleepy and lethargic while your body gradually gets used to your new schedule. However no matter how groggy you feel, don’t let yourself nap. Sleeping during the day will make it harder for you to fall asleep at night, and you’ll undo the hard work you did by waking up early.

"Like a loan, a grant is typically a one-time infusion of cash. Unlike a loan, however, you do not have to pay back the money. You can think of a grant as free money. But it can be trickier to qualify for a grant than for a loan. Typically, grants are awarded to businesses that meet special criteria. For example, non-profits, minority- or women-owned businesses and those that perform highly-technical research and development activities often qualify for grant money.  The federal government does not give grants for starting or growing a small business. Some businesses do receive federal grant money if they are involved in something related to a policy initiative. For example, the Small Business Administration (SBA) can sometimes make grants to non-profits for education and training. Also, federal grants sometimes fund medical research, science, education and highly-technical research and development activities.SBA grants for non-profits are announced on grants.gov.  Businesses qualifying for specific initiative grants authorized by Congress will be notified.  U.S. government’s Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program and its Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs offer grants for high-tech research and development. You can find out about these grants at SBIR.gov.  State and local governments sometimes offer grants to specific kinds of businesses. For example, some states offer grants for expanding child care facilities. Other initiatives for which you may find state grants include developing energy-efficient technology and creating marketing for tourism. You usually are required to match funds if you receive one of these grants. Also, the grants are typically small, so you may have to seek other forms of financing, such as a loan., Most states offer grants for women- or minority-owned businesses. Also, federal agencies assist women and minorities to find funding to start or expand their businesses. Finally, private funding sources are available for women- and minority-owned businesses.Go to the business section of your state’s website to find available grants. Here you will also find information about any incentives or programs your state has available for your business.  Visit the Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) at mbda.gov. This agency is run by the U.S. Department of Commerce, and it helps minorities and women to establish and expand their businesses. Here you can research grants and find links to state funding for your business.  Private companies that fund grants for women-owned businesses include Huggies, Chase Google, InnovateHER, Fedex, Idea Cafe, the Woman Veteran Entrepreneur Corp (WVEC), Walmart and Zion’s Bank.  Private companies that offer grants for minority-owned businesses include Fedex, the National Association for the Self Employed (NASE), Miller Lite and Huggies.

"If you go into the election with a clear idea of who you would like to see win, who less favorable choices are, and who you most definitely would not like to see in power, you will be able to vote in a more decisive manner.  The research you have conducted up until this point should prepare you to make a clear and informed choice.  Primaries can be open, closed, or semi-closed. You can try different tactical voting methods depending on the type of primary.  In an open primary, where voters can vote for any party regardless of their own party preference, you can try “crossover” voting. In this case, you would attempt to influence the nomination of a party which allows “crossover” voting by voting in that party’s primary. This way, you could try to swing the other party's nomination to be more liberal or conservative, depending on your preference.  For example, if you are a Libertarian, you could vote in the Democratic primary for the candidate who you find most agreeable or the one you dislike the least.Parties allowing “crossover” voting this election are the American Independent, Democratic, and Libertarian parties.Certain states will only permit “crossover” voting for unaffiliated voters. In that case, you have to be registered as No-Party Preference in order to cast a vote for a specific party different from your affiliation.Another tactical voting strategy for primaries involves partisans voting for the candidate generally considered to be weaker or the “lesser of two evils” in another party’s open primary. The goal with this strategy is to have the other party’s nominee be easier to defeat in the general election., This might mean casting an insincere vote - not voting for the option you actually prefer but instead simply voting for somebody who has a higher chance of winning and who you tolerate.If you gauge from the election forecast that your preferred candidate/party has a fair chance of winning - is in first or second place, say - then simply vote for them, or rank them highest in your list of choices.  If your preferred candidate is less likely to win according to the election forecast, then vote for your second or third choice candidate (if they are more likely to win).  In this case, you would only vote for one candidate even though you have the option to vote for more.  This could be a good strategy if there are, say, two seats available and you know your preferred candidate is not going to get the most votes but might come a close second. In such a case, you would not want to risk having a third candidate take the second spot, so only vote for one candidate., This means voting for a party’s entire slate of candidates for every office. While only a few states offer this option, this is a good strategy if your goal is for nominees to be only from your party.  ","rank candidates. vote in the primaries. vote for whoever in your party you think has a greater chance of winning. cast a bullet vote. participate in straight-ticket voting. "
"Because creativity flourishes during moments of solitude, you may benefit from selectively choosing periods to boost this aspect of yourself. When you are not distracted by the demands of others on your time, your mind opens up to greater possibilities.Being alone is a great time to brainstorm a new business idea, write a novel, develop a new song, make pottery, improve your photography skills, and so on. Even if you do not work in an obvious creative field, you can still benefit from this creativity boost.  Although you can pursue passions and interests with others, you can also have fun pursuing them alone. Whatever it is that makes you feel relaxed and happy, do it by yourself. This brings with it the added value of allowing you to relax and de-stress on your own. You can also do things that maybe your friends or partner are not interested in or do not have time to join in on.  Solo activities cover the full spectrum of hobbies. You can go for a hike, read a book, visit a museum, or shop at a flea market., Just because you’re not spending time with any humans doesn’t mean you can’t enjoy time with an animal companion. Caring for pets can help you overcome a multitude of ills, such as loneliness, depression or anxiety. Pets influence us to go outdoors, they provide companionship without requiring conversation, and they help us make healthier decisions., Alone time is a perfect opportunity to do activities that are nurturing and soothing to your mind, body, and soul. Many people neglect self-care because they are so busy with other obligations. However, tending to your mental and emotional well-being can allow you to perform better, concentrate better, and even fight stress in your daily life--no matter what your career involves.Self-care activities can be anything you enjoy doing that restores you. It could be meditating in the mornings before starting your daily routine. It could be relaxing in a hot bath after a long day of work.  Choose a few activities that you find soothing and do them during your alone time each week. You might find, after doing this for a few days/weeks, that you have actually come to like solitude!

"No person is ever perfect, but as the U.S. author John Steinbeck once said “Now that you don’t have to be perfect, you can be good.” Remind yourself that even Olympic gold medalists get points off on their scores (but still win). That Albert Einstein made (but learned from) his mistakes and imperfect solutions. Never let “perfect” undermine your self-esteem and become the enemy of all the excellent, worthwhile (but unfortunately imperfect) things you are capable of.  Striving for absolute “perfection” can be counterproductive, because it can diminish an accomplishment or task completion just because it is not flawless success. Perfectionism is also closely linked to depression, troubled relationships, and decreased life satisfaction.;  , If you are unsure whether something you wish to do will upset your parents, ask first. If you are hesitant to ask, it is probably a good sign that it will upset your parents.  When asking, always ensure you've thought through the possible outcomes of what you are asking to do and anticipate the concerns your parents will have.  Don't get upset. Although your parents may seem resistant to your suggestion, remember to stay cool-headed and present facts and examples that illustrate why you should do something and why you are capable of handling any outcomes.  Especially if you are still living at home, if your parents say 'no,' always honor their wishes, even if it is not what you would prefer.  When you have promised parents you will do something, but wait until you have to be told again (and again), it can create negative tensions.  Set expectations early. Say “Mom, I have to finish before I’ll have time, but as soon as I am free, I will take care of this,” then complete all tasks before having to be asked additional times.  Anticipate needs and fill them. Do you know what days garbage runs on? Are guest expected over the weekend? Take out the garbage, clean your room and other rooms in the house, all without being asked.  You may not initially agree with what your parents are saying, but remind yourself that they have your best interests at heart.  They have seen more of life than you have and may have insights that you are too young to have access to.  Trust that they are looking out for you and don’t back talk. Back talk creates arguments and can be counterproductive to establishing yourself as respectful and trustworthy.  Demonstrate respect for yourself by caring for your body’s needs and maintaining a healthy appearance. Your parents love you and it reassures them to see you healthy and well-cared for.  Keep up with hygiene and cleanliness. Try to take a bath or shower daily. At the very least, wipe off sweat and grime with a soapy wash cloth. Wash hair every 1-3 days.Wear clean clothes and comb your hair. Iron clothes that need ironing. Wear a belt with pants, especially loose ones. Style hair to keep it out of your face.  Eat regular, healthy meals. Three meals a day is traditionally recommended; however, nutritionists have indicated that 5-6 smaller meals spread over the day can actually be healthier for us and maintain a more even blood sugar. Regardless of which meal plan you choose, make sure you are eating enough to be healthy.Go to bed at a reasonable hour. Teens between the ages of 14 to 17 need 8-10 hours of sleep a night. Anyone over the age of 18 needs at somewhere between 7-9 hours.  Although we often want to show our parents how successful and capable we are, there are times when we may need help to reach our desired goals.  Don’t be too proud or egotistical to accept help from your parents, even in the form of advice.  When you do take help, be humble and show gratitude for the contributions your parents make.  When we are young, the world is ours and we can let our ambitions guide what happens. But think about how difficult it can be for parents to adjust to rapid changes that we take for granted.  When you get married, get a job, move to a new place, it can remind them of their own mortality, or make them lonely for the days when you were just down the hall.  Help parents adjust to your own evolution. Take time to talk with them and let them ask questions. Help them understand, but don’t be angry if they can’t always do it. Remind them that acceptance and trust are just as powerful as understanding.  Being true to you means that you are confident, happy, learning, and growing. Nothing makes a parent more content than seeing their child coming into their own and being successful. When you are true to you, you are actualizing the person your parents raised you to be. Sometimes, however, being true to you will initially create tension with parents.  For example, if you parents want you to attend church with them, but you are not religious, let them know that you wish not to go. If you still have to attend their church, consider how you can still be true to your values during the experience. Resources like the Skeptics Bible offer some great conversation starters to get people thinking about the contradictions and inconsistencies within religious scriptures.Are you worried about coming out to your parents? While your sexuality is an important part of who you are and should be celebrated, if you are living at home with your parents, you may not want to share this part of yourself at that time. If you are living away from home and worried about talking to your parents about your sexual orientation, consider speaking to a therapist about the best 'coming out' options for your circumstances., Parents want more than anything from their daughter is that she grows up to have a safe and happy life. Part of having that life, however, is that your parents want to be a part of it and offer assistance that will help secure that happiness. They also want to share in your relationships, help raise possible grandchildren, and enjoy watching their family grow., Take the advantages, kindness, support, and generosity you’ve been shown by your parents and offer it to others. That could be your own children, your spouse, friends, and other family members.  Volunteer to be a “Big Sister,” who offers support and life guidance to at-risk young women.When you use what you’ve been given you help others, you show respect and gratitude for the upbringing your parents gave you.  When families grow and gain new members, it can require some adjustment, particularly for the new addition. Remember that your partner loves you for who you are, and that you should not try to be someone else. At the same time, look for opportunities to make connections to his or her family., Although every family does things differently, many families accept new members by immediately treating them as a new sibling or child.  If you are an only child and have never had siblings before, think of sibling relationships as being like living with a best friend for most of your life. Everyone tries to get along, have fun, and take care of each other, with lots of compromises.  Accept that hugs, jokes, and some teasing may come along with being the new sibling, but that it is coming from a place of love and welcome. Reciprocate in turn when possible.  Especially if you have just married into a new family, be sure to plan for at least an hour a day of “Me” time during visits.  'Me' time may be when you say “I’m going to have a quick nap” and then rest for a few moment, thinking back over the events of the day, releasing any possible stress that may have built up.  You can even ask you partner to join you, especially if there is something you are confused about any want to ask questions.  Over time, as you and your partner's family become better acquainted, these quiet moments may not even be necessary.  The relationship between a parent and biological child can permit a degree of honesty unmatched by any other relationship. While your partner may be able to tell their parents anything, remember that they are getting to know you, and tact can be important maintaining peace.  Remember to never lie to your partner’s family, but also remember to break difficult truths with respect and kindness.  When we begin a relationship with a partner’s family, we usually want them to like us as much as possible. Yet, while compromise is important, it is equally as important not to sacrifice your entire personal comfort for someone else.  For example, are your partner’s parents asking you to come visit for the holidays when you both really want to stay home? If you and your partner agree, be kind, but firm, in letting the rest of the family know that you will be delighted to join them at a different time, but can’t make the requested date.  This may cause disappointment at first but, in the long-run, establishes reasonable expectations and mutual respect.  There are points on which you will never agree with a partner’s family. This is not a sign of failure or incompatibility. Instead, think of it as a challenge, to love and be tolerant in spite of differences.  For example, do you already know that your partner’s parents have different politics than you? If anyone asks, say “You know, I’ve never been entirely comfortable talking about politics. Mind if I sit this one out and listen?”  If pushed, gently remind others that you respect their beliefs and feelings, love them dearly, hope they can respect your feelings as well.  Compromise is a key part of maintaining healthy family relationships. This may mean accepting that your partner’s family has completely different holiday traditions, or that Aunt Margaret will always makes her macaroni and cheese for special occasions (even though that was what you always made).  While you should never give up all the habits and rituals that bring joy and meaning to your life, you may find that you need to adjust how and when you observe your own traditions. For example, if Aunt Margaret always makes the macaroni and cheese, ask your partner what kind of dish you could make that could become a family staple.  Another compromise is to have your own Christmas tree and cookies for Santa at home but still enjoy lighting the menorah and having noodle kugel with your partner’s family.  Welcoming a new person to the family can be a joyous but also stressful occasion.  It can remind your in-laws that they are aging, or that their child/brother/sister lives far away, or that there may be limitations on how much family time that can be spent together, which can bring mixed feelings into play.  While you should never be a door mat or accept disrespect, understand what families go through when a new person is added and attempt to give in-laws the benefit of the doubt before becoming upset or angry.  Think about your own personal life, as well as the relationship you share with family, including parents. What aspects could be made more comfortable, productive, or enjoyable? Below are exercises in mindfulness that can help you be a better daughter:  Strive for excellence in all tasks you undertake. When you complete tasks without a commitment to success or improvement, you show a lack of concern for the people impacted by the outcome. Instead, demonstrate love, care, and respect by attempting to complete all tasks successfully, pushing for above-average outcomes. Let your parents feel proud of what you have accomplished  Look for new ways to make positive changes. This could be something as simple as planting flowers in your parent’s garden or deciding to ask your supervisor for a promotion at work. When you make a personal effort to bring happiness to yourself or the people who care about you, you demonstrate a commitment to being a better person for yourself and others., When long periods go without talking to your parents, it can be difficult to make the call when either party needs help or support. For this reason, try to reach out to your parents as often as is convenient and comfortable for both of you.  For younger adults, this could mean daily check-ins via text to a conversation over dinner. For adult children, try to text and/or call your parents multiple times a week. It doesn’t have to be an important message. It might be as simple as seeing your mom’s favorite flower and wanting to say “hi,” to sharing a funny observation from work.Reach out first. Don’t always be the one waiting on a phone call or text. Make time to talk to your parents and call them. Or if you live away from home, invite them to come visit. By reminding our parents of their importance to us, we cement bonds and offer reassurance.  When parents tell us to listen, it means more than just nodding while they talk. Demonstrate that you are not only engaged but learning through active listening. This is not just an act of respect. It also ensures that you remember what they’ve told you and can act on it appropriately. Below are tactics for active listening:Restate information: This demonstrates that you are attentive and also gives you the ability to clarify things you are less certain of.  Offer subtle 'encouragers': Nod your head. Say 'uh huh' or 'I see' so your parents continue speaking and elaborate on their ideas.  Summarize: Before ending the conversation or asking questions, summarize information into your own words. This helps you remember what was said, but also allows for your parents to say “That one part is not quite right, let me explain again” in order to offer correction.  Give feedback: If something strikes you as a good idea, say “I agree that this is good, because…” If you are less certain of another part, say “I’m less certain about this part. Can you explain it again?” This allows you to collaborate and even nuance the information. Depending on the situation, your parents might even welcome suggestions or alternative ideas.  Probe for more information: when in doubt, ask questions to draw out elaboration, make distinctions, or clarify information. Make sure that you completely understand what you’ve been told and how will impact your behavior.  Validation: Remind your parents that that you appreciate them taking the time to offer guidance and instruction. Give hugs, make a card, say “Thank you.” Always demonstrate your gratitude for and appreciation of your parents.  Although it can be tempting to remind our parents of mistakes they’ve made, unless it is key to your protection or health, resist the urge to dwell on the past.Forgive. Forgiveness is not a free pass. It doesn’t mean that mistakes that happened are ok or validated. But what it does mean is that you are willing to move on and love in spite of mistakes. That you accept your parents as human and, like you, not expected to be perfect.  Repair disagreements quickly. The longer a disagreement remains unresolved, the longer resentment builds and the more difficult it can be to make amends. Additionally, when we don’t resolve lingering issues with those closest to us, we build a pattern of behavior that will continue into future relationships as well—even those with our own children. For these reasons, it is best to repair damaged relationships quickly and develop the conflict resolution skills required to be a better person, daughter, and mother.  ","be realistic. always ask first. honor your responsibilities. be respectful. take care of yourself. take help. be patient with your parents. be true to you. have a happy life. pay it forward. balance individuality and closeness. be open to new family relationships. give yourself “me” time. be honest. set boundaries. agree to disagree. be open to change. empathize. be mindful. communicate. listen carefully. stay in the present.

"Depending on your hair type, you may need special products to condition and treat your hair. From natural oils like coconut oil to specialty products like hair mayonnaise and a protein pack, use the right combinations that work to keep your hair healthy.Consult a stylist or haircare specialist to find what works best for you.  There are natural essential oils and mixtures that can keep your hair moisturized like, lavender and rosemary if you are concerned with using a chemical formula.;  , Whether you use a professional or are create them on your own, braid about six big rows. Make sure to leave the front edges of your hair out. Specifically, leave the hair along your temples and front of your face out of your corn rows., You may twist your hair out or use a clip to keep them from your face. Treat your hair with a product like Jamaican castor oil to moisturize and strengthen the hair. Allow the product to work while you move onto your synthetic wig., Depending on your budget and timeframe, there are a variety of options when it comes to finding a weave best suited to create your wig. Whether you’re looking for curls, kinks, or straight hair, consult a hair care specialist or beauty supply store to familiarize yourself with your best options. Synthetic weaves are more cost-effective than ones made from real hair.  Most synthetic hair looks unrealistic. They may be made out of shiny plastic so choose one that looks as natural as possible. A curly weave looks more natural than a straight weave., Some people have hair that is curlier or kinkier than others. If you have extremely shiny kinky hair, do not choose a wig that has large curls without any shine.  Weaves can come in a variety of colours so don’t settle on something that is significantly a different shade from your own hair. Weaves that have a mixture of dark and light strands may look more natural than ones that are a single shade., One pack of 3 bundles is enough for a full hair wig. You can use 2 textures: natural texture and the remy closure texture on top. However, if you want larger curls or generally more volume, choose the appropriate bundles of weave to complete your look., If you have sensitive skin or your scalp gets easily irritated, choose a breathable weaving cap with a mesh lining. Mesh is less itchy than plastic or synthetic linings. Mesh is also easier to manipulate and conceal.A breathable weaving cap allows you to wash your wigs and cut down on drying time. Find a soft elastic velvet that the skin on your head and neck do not get itchy and irritated.  Whether you borrow your supplies from your friends or buy your own from a beauty supply store, you will need a styrofoam wig head, wig stand, weaving cap, hair-sewing thread and needle, scissors, tweezers, foundation, and hair care products. Create a budget to ensure that you choose the best products for your price. Look online for used beauty supplies to keep your costs low.  You will need to know the circumference of your head and compare it to the circumference of the wig head. The second measurement you need to take is from your hairline to the nape of your neck. If your head is larger than the wig head, use wrapping tape and continually wrap it around the circumference of the wig head as many times as you need until it fills out the difference. Do the same from the hairline to the nape of the wig head’s neck., Use pins to secure your weaving cap onto the styrofoam head. Pin the elastic dome band along the front of the head, above the ears, and along the nape of the neck. Also, pin the unhooked elastic bands down so that they are out of the way. Make sure to place the styrofoam wig head onto the wig stand.Make sure to completely stretch your weaving cap down onto the wig head.  Place wefts of hair -- essentially, small curtains or bunches -- onto the weaving cap. Thread your needle and thread through the cap and around the track or the weft of the hair. Pull the needle through the loop of the thread as it comes up to securely form a thread track. This method helps to lay the tracks flush against the wig cap.Don’t sew through the weave tracks because it slows you down and may cause shedding after too much wear.  The fold is going to be at the edge of the cap. Pin down the new row to hold it in place as you secure the new row of weave. Go right back through the edge of the cap and both of the wefts with the needle and hair thread. Use the same blanket stitch method twice on the small fold at the end of the track to make sure that the fold is very flat and flush to the edge of the cap.There shouldn’t be anything sticking out or funny around the wig if you double blanket stitch the fold.  Use 2 fingers as spacing in between each track of hair that you lay down. As you get closer to the top of the wig head, start to space out each track closer together using just one finger for spacing.Use the fold over method to keep the layers of weave together as a wig. Start off by sewing through the thickest part of the cap and go through the actual weft of the hair so that you’re sure that it’s down nice and tight.  Pin down a bundle from the forehead to the nape of the neck and sew all the way around to make sure that it’s down. You will be sewing along the centre of the styrofoam head, from the forehead to the nape of the neck. Make sure that you are covering the lace and that the tracks are secure. Use a regular stitch to make sure you’re securing the lace closure nice and tight to the weaving cap all the way around with a vertical stitch., Whether it’s uneven hair, odd patches, or excess mesh lining, use scissors to personalize your look. Cut off excess mesh at its hairline to ensure that it never shows when you wear it., Pluck out random strands of hair to clean up your part and create a smooth transition to your natural hair. Don’t remove too much hair or you may look like you have thinning hair or a bald spot.Create a natural part. Don’t try to create a completely straight line because it will look unnatural.  This may take trial and error depending on the material of the wig. Your wig won’t take the same shades as your real skin so you may have to use colours that are a couple shades darker or lighter than what you normally use.Don’t be afraid to use a variety of colours until the wig matches your scalp and looks natural. Be liberal with the makeup as you apply it onto the meshing of the wig. Keep in mind that the meshing may take a while to get your desired look.  Add some talc powder to a hair brush and brush through your wig. The combination of brushing and talc powder removes some of the shine from synthetic hair. This will give you a more natural and muted look., Using your fingers, separate the curls in your wig to increase the volume. For a natural look you don’t want your wig to just lay there. Add shape and depth by increasing the volume.Detangle your wig every day using your hands in order to prevent knotting. If you use a comb you may pull out the hair or damage the wig., Breath some life back into your hair before applying your weave especially if it looks dry matted. Avoid using any oil as this will make the ends stick together., Use a needle and hair thread for maximum security. If you do not have the time, you can also use bobby pins. Hair thread is a lot more secure than bobby pins, which tend to fall out if you play with your hair or are planning to be active., Placing the wig just behind your natural hairline, sew it to the cornrowed hair at the middle of your head, the back of your head, the nape of your neck, and at both sides of your head. If you have chosen to create a part in your hair, also sew your wig at the part.Depending on your time and budget, you may seek a hair care specialist to attach your wig. Don’t be discouraged if this is your first time. With time and practice you will become more proficient at applying both a secure and natural look.  As you have placed your weave behind your natural hairline and kept the natural hair at the edges of your face in twists or clipped, unravel your natural hair once you’re satisfied with the positioning of your wig.Adjust your natural hair together with the wig you have just made out of weave to create a natural looking blend. Ensure that the texture is maintained throughout your head. Make sure your natural hair still has the same type of kink or curl as your wig.

"Take a dry nylon (plastic) comb and run it through your hair about 10 times. Your hair must be dry as well. When the comb moves through your hair, it picks up electrons — tiny particles with an electric charge.If you don't have a comb, find a plastic spoon or an inflated balloon instead. Rub the object quickly against your hair, or a piece of fur, wool, or carpet. The friction from rubbing the two materials together knocks electrons loose from one object and onto the other.;  , Only let a very thin stream of water flow. It needs to be a smooth stream, not one that breaks up.  If the comb (or spoon or balloon) picked up enough charge, the water will bend toward the comb as it falls. See 'Why this works' below for an explanation.  Electrical charges come in two types, positive and negative. Those electrons that ended up on your comb have a negative charge, while water molecules have a positive charge on one side. Positive and negative charges pull each other closer together, so when the comb is close enough, the positive side of the water molecules get tugged in that direction.When the negatively charged comb comes near the water, it repels the electrons, so that the side of the water nearest the comb then has a positive charge. The attraction between this positive charge and the negatively charged comb results in a net force on the water, bending the stream., Bend water again, but change the variables, one at a time. See how they affect the result. Can you explain why?  Does the temperature of the water affect how much it bends?  Does a bigger object make the water bend more?  Does the material that the object is made of affect its ability to bend water?  How does the strength of the stream flow affect how much it bends?  , Try rubbing an inflated balloon against your hair as fast as you can. Gently put the balloon against a bare patch of wall and let go. If the balloon picked up enough charge, it will stay there against the wall without falling.This works because the balloon weighs almost nothing, so gravity barely affects it. The electrical attraction between the balloon and the wall is strong enough to resist the pull of the whole world!  You can also tear up tiny bits of paper and pick them up with the balloon.  When trying this experiment, you might have put down the comb, then discovered it can't bend water anymore after you pick it up again. Some objects (especially metal ones) can suck up all the extra electrons with a touch, so your comb loses its charge. This is called 'grounding.' Scientists and engineers use grounding on purpose to protect themselves from electric shocks. You can too:  Wait until a dry day, when it hasn't rained in a while. Static electricity builds up much faster when there is almost no water in the air.  Find an object that often gives you a shock.

"Wash your carrots if they need it. Some baby carrots are pre-washed. You can cut them in half, if you wish, or leave them whole. Dry them off a little before moving on to the next step., Place the carrots, oil, and seasonings in a plastic bag. Zip the bag up, and shake it thoroughly to coat the carrots in seasonings and oil.You can also simply mix them up in a bowl.  Use a spoonful or two of oil (olive or vegetable) per two pounds (0.9 kilograms) of carrots. Use a dash or two of each seasoning, making sure you have enough so that each carrot has some.  Use whatever method you prefer to grill the carrots, stirring them occasionally. They'll need about 20 minutes over medium heat, and they should be fork-tender when you're done.

"Though it may seem unnecessary, having a theme will help you know what decorations to buy, what food to prepare, and what games to plan. Character parties are popular (think Sponge Bob or Scooby-Doo), but general themes work, too (pirates, fairies, princesses, cowboys, etc.). Unless they want something that just isn't appropriate, allow them creative freedom. Sit down with your child at the table with a pen and paper and write down all the ideas you both like.  Some themes will obviously be more difficult than others. Go with your child to a couple of party stores and see what's available or go online. It'll be easiest to pick a theme based on what you have at your disposal. Most parents aren't Martha Stewart; you certainly don't have to be.;  , There are a few questions you'll have to address: When is the party going to be? How long will it last? Where is it going to be? Is there anything going on communally or culturally that would prevent other children from coming? What time of day works into your schedule?  Take your child's age into account. Generally, the younger the child, the earlier the party. You do not have to entertain all day--a few hours is more than sufficient. If you're not having it at home, consult the desired venue to see what times are available.  Once you have them picked out, it's time to finalize the details. Check your schedule to make sure there are no girl scouts or work meetings during the time you're thinking. On the invitation, put the start and end times, address, what each child should bring (swimsuit, etc.) and if there will be a meal so parents can plan accordingly.  As for guests, a good rule of thumb is the child's age plus 1.And if parents can come along, great! It's best to have a couple others to help with monitoring and clean up.  Have your invitations in the theme of your party. The other children will probably get excited, too. Your child can hand them out at school (if possible to do it discreetly) or you can give them to the parents if your child is too young (or forgetful!).  Your child shouldn't hand them out in front of those not invited -- it might make the others feel bad. Give them to the teacher to put in the take home folder or have your child put them in desks or lockers.  For everything from table cloths to pinatas, a party store is your best bet -- or else you'll end up bouncing around town for days looking to piece it all together. And if they don't have a specific something, ask! They may be able to order it for you.  It's always an option to make your own if you're DIY handy. And your child can always help if you want someone to blame the poor penmanship on! As an alternative idea, a few children can come over a bit earlier to make decorations themselves, if they'd like.  ","pick a theme with your child. nail down the specifics. get invitations (that match the theme!). buy decorations. "
"Not all types of flowers are safe to eat. Don’t buy flowers that have been treated with pesticides, insecticides, growth agents or other toxic chemicals. These can make you very sick.In general, it may be best to find a source other than supermarket florists for fresh flowers. Most of the flowers sold in these places are grown in highly-controlled conditions using various chemicals.;  , Check with the florist to see if the flowers they sell are grown organically. Flowers grown naturally are generally the best to use for culinary purposes, as they don’t contain chemical additives that can leach into your cake. In most cases, vendors are required to disclose whether or not their flowers are organic.Visit a local farm, greenhouse or flower nursery to find flowers that have been cultivated using safe, organic growing practices.Even organic flowers may not be suitable for human consumption. Certain species contain saps and microbes that may cause irritation to the eyes, skin or digestive tract if they come into contact with food., Think about the kind of cake you’re making when you pick out flowers to decorate it. Try to match colors and textures, or create a tasteful contrast. For instance, white flowers such as will look subtle and elegant on a white cake, whereas bright red roses might be used to offset softer pastel colored cakes.Take a look at which types of flowers are safe to consume or use in foods and which are harmful., Certain species of flowering plants can be safely consumed. These flowers offer unique, perfumed flavor notes and make an effortless addition to floral cakes because they don't need to be removed prior to serving. Some of the most common types of edible flowers include roses, begonias, chrysanthemums, daisies, dandelions and hibiscus. Each of these edibles can be distinguished by their subtle flavors, which should be used to enhance the flavor of the cake they're to be added to.Flowers like dandelion, chicory and calendula feature bright, zesty notes that can be used to offset the sweetness of a frosted cake, while mild herbal flowers like hibiscus and lavender work well with naked cakes and those garnished with fresh fruit.Though they are technically edible, it is not advisable to use more fragrant types of flowers like roses, carnations and jasmine as food additives, as the chemicals that lend them their characteristic scents can easily overpower the flavors of the confection.  Before you begin decorating, rinse the flower from petal to stem under a light stream of cool water. Just like with produce, you should wash flowers before putting them to culinary use to remove any traces of soil, bacteria or insects. Even if the flowers you’ve bought are organically grown, they should be rinsed to avoid contaminated food items.Be careful not to damage the delicate flower blossoms by rinsing them under too high a water pressure or scrubbing them by hand.  ","find out where your flowers came from. look for flowers grown organically. choose flowers that complement your cake. use edible flowers. wash the flowers thoroughly. "
"Piano tabs usually take the form of a series of horizontal lines, each labeled with a number at its far left, like this:5|------------------------------  4|------------------------------  3|------------------------------  2|------------------------------  Though this arrangement may at first seem to bear no resemblance to the black and white keys of a keyboard, piano tabs actually represent different regions on the keyboard through clever shorthand. The number at the left of each line represents the octave that the notes represented on the line are located in. Piano tabs define their octaves relative to the C scale - starting from the far left of the keyboard, the first C note on the piano begins the first octave, the second C note begins the second octave, and so on up to the highest C note.  For instance, in the sample tab lines provided above, the lines represent, starting from the top, the fifth, fourth, third, and second octaves from the farthest-left C, respectively. It's not necessary for piano tabs to include lines for every octave on the keyboard - just the octaves in which notes are played.;  , The letters A through G should be spread throughout the lines of the piano tab, like this:5|-a-d-f------------------------  4|-a-d-f------------------------  3|-------c-D-e-f-G--------------  2|-----------------f-e-d-c------  You may have already guessed that each letter corresponds to a note in the scale! Lowercase letters signify 'natural' (not sharp or flat) notes, which are the white keys on the keyboard. Upper-case letters signify sharps, which are the black keys. For example, 'C' is the black key to the right of 'c', which is a white key. Notes on the lines of the tab are meant to be played in the octave that corresponds to the line. For instance, notes on line 4 in the sample tab above are played in the keyboard's fourth octave.  For simplification of writing and to avoid confusion between the flat symbol, which resembles a lowercase 'b', and the note 'b', there are no flats in piano tabs. Instead, all flats are written as the equivalent sharp (eg: D-flat ('Db') is written as C-sharp ('C')).  Like pieces of sheet music, tabs are read from left to right. The notes at the far left of the tab are played first, followed by the notes to the right. If the tab is longer than the screen or page, it can 'wrap around' below each time it reaches the edge - just like sheet music. Often, but not always, piano tabs include vertical lines marking the barrier between each measure - usually, these are represented with capital letter 'I's' or with vertical line characters, like this:5|-a-d-f---------|---------------  4|-a-d-f---------|---------------  3|-------c-D-e-f-|G--------------  2|---------------|--f-e-d-c------  If so, treat the space between each set of vertical lines as one measure.  In other words, for songs in 4/4, there are four quarter notes between each set of lines, for songs in 6/8, there are six eighth notes, and so on.  Start reading a piano tab at its far left and play the notes in order from left to right as you encounter them. If two or more notes are directly above each other, play them at the same time as a chord.  In our example tab:5|-a-d-f---------|---------------  4|-a-d-f---------|---------------  3|-------c-D-e-f-|G--------------  2|---------------|--f-e-d-c------  ...we would first play the A in the fifth octave and the A in the fourth octave, then the D in the fifth octave and the D in the fourth octave, then the F in the fifth octave and the F in the fourth octave, then the notes C, D sharp, E, and F in sequence, and so on.  One weakness of tabs in general is that it is difficult to express rhythm via basic tablature notation. This can become problematic when dealing with sustains, rests, syncopated passages, etc. As a workaround, some tab writers actually count the beat of the song below or above the tab. Such a tab might look like this:5|-a-d-f---------|---------------  4|-a-d-f---------|---------------  3|-------c-D-e-f-|G--------------  2|---------------|--f-e-d-c------  ||1---2---3---4--|1---2---3---4--  In this case, the notes roughly above '1' are roughly on the first beat, the ones roughly about '2' are roughly on the second beat, and so on. This is hardly a perfect system, but it makes the most of the limitations of the tab format.  Some piano tabs include off-beat markings. Often, these take the form of an ampersand ('&') to mirror the common method of counting off-beats, as in 'one and two and three and four and...' Such a tab might look like this:5|-a-d-f---------|---------------  4|-a-d-f---------|---------------  3|-------c-D-e-f-|G--------------  2|---------------|--f-e-d-c------  ||1-&-2-&-3-&-4-&|1-&-2-&-3-&-4-&  , Another weakness of the tab format is that it's difficult to express how long to hold a certain note or how long to rest between notes via tabs. Some tabs don't mark rests and sustains at all - after a held note, for instance, there will just be the series of dashes that make up the line. Other tabs will use a series of '>' characters after notes to show that they should be held. See below:5|-a-d-f---------|---------------  4|-a-d-f---------|---------------  3|-------c-D-e-f-|G--------------  2|---------------|--f-e-d-c>>>>>>  ||1-&-2-&-3-&-4-&|1-&-2-&-3-&-4-&  In this case, we would hold the final C note from beat 3 to the end of the measure.  Staccato notes are the opposite of sustained notes - they are short, sharp, and truncated. Many piano tabs use periods to denote certain notes as staccato. See below:5|-a.-d.-f.------|---------------  4|-a.-d.-f.------|---------------  3|--------c-D-e-f|G--------------  2|---------------|--f-e-d-c>>>>>>  ||1-&-2-&-3-&-4-&|1-&-2-&-3-&-4-&  In this case, we play the first three octave chords as staccato.  Usually, but not always, the higher notes in a piece of piano music are played with the right hand, while the lower notes are played with the left hand, so it's usually safe to assume that the highest notes in a tab are played with the right hand and that the lowest notes are played with the left. However, some tabs specify exactly which notes should be played with each hand. In these cases, lines with an 'R' at the far left of the tab are played with the right hand and lines with an 'L' at the far left of the tab are played with the left hand. See below:R 5|-a.-d.-f.------|---------------  R 4|-a.-d.-f.------|---------------  L 3|--------c-D-e-f|G--------------  L 2|---------------|--f-e-d-c>>>>>>  O ||1-&-2-&-3-&-4-&|1-&-2-&-3-&-4-&  In this case, the fourth and fifth octaves are played with the right hand, while the second and third are played with the left.  Note that the 'O' at the far left of the beat markings at the bottom of the tab was used simply to fill space and has no bearing on the tab itself.  ","break the keyboard into octaves which correspond to lines on the tab. locate the notes in the tab based on the octave of the line they're on. read tabs from left to right, paying attention to any measure breaks (marked with i's). play notes sequentially as you read from left to right. read repeating numbers above or below the tab as beats. learn how rests and sustains are expressed in tabs. play notes marked with a period as staccato. look for 'r's' and 'l's' on the left of the tab as a guide for which hand to use.

"To be less confrontational, try to put yourself in the other person’s shoes and understand how he or she feels. This is called empathy and it begins with listening. Hear others out, learn to listen effectively, and learn to listen actively.Try to focus on what the other person is expressing. Listen – you don’t have to say anything at all to start. Just let him speak his mind.  Resist the urge to interrupt. You will have a chance to express your side of the story. Meanwhile, try to convey that you’re paying attention by giving cues like nodding your head or by saying “Yes” or “I understand.” Try to do this without butting in.  Ignore your own opinions and feelings for the time being, until your peer has said his or her piece. This will be challenging, but keep in mind that your goal is not to interpolate your viewpoint but to understand the other person’s. Focus on this other experience.All that you are doing is to suspend your judgement and opinions. It doesn’t mean you will have to accept the other person’s perspective, just to temporarily let go.  For starters, don’t disregard the other person’s views out of hand. It is rude and confrontational to tell someone that they should just “Get over it” or “Deal with it.”  , One way that you can listen more intently to another person and take in what they are saying is to engage with them actively. Try paraphrasing. This is when you restate what you’ve heard in slightly different words to make sure that you understand correctly. You might also ask questions.For instance, repeat back the main point once your peer has said something, i.e. “So, what you’re saying is that you don’t think I respect you” or “So, you seem to think that I’m too confrontational. Is that it?”  Paraphrasing shows that you’re listening respectfully to the other person. It also helps you better grasp his or her perspective.  Try asking some questions, too. Aim for open-ended questions to draw out more of a response. Ask something like “Why is it specifically that you think I don’t listen? Can you give some examples?”  , People will appreciate it if you take a moment to affirm their views. You can do this even if you don’t agree. Just let your friends, loved ones, or colleagues know that you have listened to and understood what they’ve said.For instance, you could say something like “Well, James, I don’t exactly agree with you but I respect your position.” Or “Thanks for speaking freely, Fatima. I can tell this is important for you and will give it some thought.”  ","give others a fair hearing. suspend your judgement. paraphrase. affirm what you’ve heard. "

"Some states offer their citizens an opportunity to directly propose and enact state laws and state constitutional amendments. This process, called the initiative process, can be used to outlaw the death penalty in your state. While there are quite a few states that offer an initiative process, California and Oregon are two states that utilize the practice often., The first step in the initiative process is to draft the proposed law you would like enacted. As the petitioner, you can certainly choose to write the language yourself. However, your chances of success will increase drastically if you hire help. If you are writing the language on your own, make sure you do some research into how statutes and constitutional amendments are worded. A poorly drafted law is unlikely to get the support necessary to make it on the ballot. The proposed law should be persuasive, succinct, and it should follow general legal rules of construction (e.g., where to put commas, sentence structure, etc.).  If you want to pay to get help, hire a lawyer. Lawyers have a unique understanding of how laws are worded and drafted. If you do not know any lawyers, contact your state bar association's lawyer referral service. After answering a few general questions, you will be put in contact with qualified lawyers in your area. Try to find a lawyer who has experience with your state's ballot initiative process. In a state like California, you may even be able to find a lawyer who specializes in this area of the law.  If you cannot afford a lawyer, or you want to take a different route to get help, consider petitioning your state's legislative counsel to help you. In Oregon, for example, the Legislative Counsel will assist you in drafting a proposed initiative so long as you get 50 or more signatures from electors requesting help and the Legislative Counsel Committee determines that the initiative is likely to make it on the ballot.If you get help from the legislative counsel in your state, they will draft the law with your input.  Once the proposed law has been written, you need to submit it to the state government for review. For example, in California, you must send in your proposed law, along with a written request asking that a title and summary of the proposal be written.  As a part of your proposal you will also have to submit certain declarations and certifications promising that you are proposing the initiative for proper purposes. For example, in California, you will have to declare, under penalty of perjury, that you are a citizen of the US and California and that you are over the age of 18. Also, you will have to sign a certification promising that you will not use any signatures you collect for improper purposes.  When you submit your proposal to the state, you will have to pay a fee. In California, for example, the fee is $2,000. The fee is placed in trust and will be refunded to you as long as your initiative makes it on the ballot within two years. However, if your initiative fails to make the ballot, you will forfeit the fee., Once the state government reviews your proposal and creates a working title and summary, they will post your proposal on their website and facilitate a 30-day public review process. During this 30-day period, any member of the public can submit comments about your proposal. The government will provide you with these comments and give you an opportunity to amend your proposal.  Make sure you amend your proposal quickly as you will only have a limited amount of time to do so. In California, for example, you will not be able to amend your proposal once five days have elapsed since the public comment period ended., After the public review process, you will have to format a formal petition, which will be the document you circulate in order to gather signatures. The format of your petition is dictated by state law. For example, in California, your title and summary must be at least 12-point bold font and the body of the petition must be at least 8-point font. There must be a heading, title, summary, the entire proposed text, and a signature section.Check with your state to ensure you follow the directions. If you fail to create an adequate petition, your initiative will not move forward.  In order to qualify for the ballot, your initiative must be signed by the required number of qualified voters. For example, in California, you will have to get somewhere between 365,880 and 585,407 valid signatures. This will be done by circulating your petition throughout the state and having people sign it. You can hire circulators, get volunteers, or collect signatures through other means so long as it is allowed by your state.  Each signature must be given by a registered voter who lives in the county where the petition is being circulated. Each person signing must personally place his or her signature, printed name, and address on the petition.  Once you think you have obtained the required number of signatures, you will submit your petition to the state government for review. The government will ensure that each signature is real, accurate, and not a duplicate.The government will always invalidate some signatures for various reasons so it is always a good idea to get more signatures than just the minimum. If your petition is granted, your initiative will be placed on the ballot.  ","understand the purpose of initiatives. write a proposed law. submit the proposed initiative to the secretary of state or attorney general. allow for public review. format your petition. obtain the required number of signatures.

"You can use a quality camera if you own one, but a cheap webcam works surprisingly well. Buy one with a manual focus ring, so you can adjust the focus to get sharp, close up images. You can find these online for as low as $5 USD.  Make sure you can attach the webcam to your device. On a mobile device, you will likely need to purchase a cable, and install an app that allows you to use webcams.  Some of the software recommended below will only work with webcams, or certain cameras. Check for compatibility before you spend your money.;  , You can install this on just about any device, although laptops and mobile devices are the easiest to transport around your film set. Many stop motion programs have a free trial period, so you can try them out before you buy. Read the terms first, as the trial may restrict your options, or cover your images with a watermark. Here are a few suggestions:  For Mac: iStopMotion, Boinx, Dragon Frame  For Windows: I Can Animate 2 (recommended for children), iKITMovie, or Stop Motion Pro. Windows Movie Maker is an option with fewer features, but it may already be on your computer.  For iPhone or iPad: Frameographer, Stopmotion Cafe  For Android devices: Clayframes, Stopmotion Studio  , Some good choices include clay, wire, LEGO or similar building block figures. Be imaginative; you can use almost any object to make your movie.  Start with a small project, such as an orange peeling itself. One second of film can take 18–24 photos, so you'll get plenty of practice from this.  You can draw on a whiteboard or stack of paper instead, changing the drawing slightly with every frame. If you do this, set up a stable stand to hold the drawings, so there's no accidental movement.  You can use any lights, as long as they don't flicker or change in brightness. You may need to block outside light with blinds or curtains, if clouds or other moving shadows are causing changes in brightness.  Some light bulbs take a while to reach full brightness. Leave them on to warm up while you get ready.  Set up your first shot in an area without wind or background movement. Make sure all your pieces stand up on their own. If one of them falls over during filming, it can take quite a while to set it back up in the exact position.  If a figure is tilting or threatening to fall over, stick it onto the surface with poster tack.  Take your camera and device to the location you'll be shooting. Connect your webcam or camera to your device. Open your software and confirm that it 'sees' the webcam image. Once you've worked out any kinks, set the camera on a tripod, or tape it down firmly to prevent motion. If the camera shakes as you take photos, the movie will appear chaotic and lack continuity., Take a single photo of the objects or figures in the starting position. Move the objects bit by bit, by a very small amount each time, and take another photograph after each movement. You can move one piece at a time (such as an arm waving back and forth), or make several movements at once (a more fluid walk involving legs and arms, or several objects moving in a busy scene). Try to move an object by about the same distance each time.  Before taking each photograph, make sure the object is in sharp focus. You may need to disable your camera's autofocus. If using a webcam, rotate the focus ring by hand.  Each time you take a photograph, a frame should appear in your stop motion software. These frames are placed in a row to form a strip of film, usually near the bottom of your screen. You should be able to flick between the frames or play a video to get a rough idea of what your movie will look like. Don't worry, the end result will be much smoother.  If you make a mistake, just delete the frame you just took and take another photograph.  This extremely useful feature is one major reason to use dedicated stop motion software instead of a free movie editor. With Onion Skinning enabled, the previous frame shows up as a faint image on the screen, overlaying the image your camera sees. This lets you arrange objects accurately, seeing exactly how much they will move on screen. If you knock over a figure or make a mistake and need to re-shoot a few frames, Onion Skinning makes it easy to return to the old scene by lining up the figures with the faint image.  If you can't find this feature, look for a Help or Tutorial section, or visit the website of the software developers.  Continue moving and photographing until the scene is finished. Save your work frequently. Leave your setup in place once you're done, in case you need to retake some photographs.  There's no need to finish the scene in one sitting. Taking regular breaks will help make the process a pleasure instead of a chore.  If you duplicate a frame, that frame will stay still for a tiny bit longer before moving. As a general rule, stick to one or two copies of each frame. Occasionally, slow this down to 6–8 frames between movements, so an object pauses before changing directions or starting a new motion. This looks more natural and makes your animation less frantic and easier on the eyes.  If you don't know how to do this, look for instructions for your specific software.  You can now render the project as a video file and show it to your friends. If you like, you can open the video in video editing software and add music, sound effects, and special effects.  ","choose your camera. install stop motion software. find objects and figures to use in your movie. find consistent lighting. arrange the scene. set up your camera. begin taking photographs. check your software. look for an onion skinning feature. finish shooting. duplicate frames so the movements happen at a slower pace. finish your film.

"While you were raising your children, your interests probably took a backseat in your life. Now that your kids are all out of the house, think about some goals you’d like to reach or new skills you’d like to develop. Learning something new can be a great way to distract yourself from loneliness, meet new friends, and fill your schedule.  Learn a foreign language in preparation of an upcoming trip. Or, simply sign up for a woodworking, flower-arranging or cooking class to build an entirely new skillset., Visiting someplace new can help ease your transition from full-time parent to empty-nester. Getting outside your home and into a new environment is not only exciting and fun, it can also help foster your independence, reminding you that you are your own person and that you can have fun on your own.

"Ballet comes with a variety of positions for your feet, broken down into five different categories. If you're interested in doing a ballet inspired routine, familiarize yourself with the different foot positions. Each position involves rotating the legs at a 90 degree angle from the hip joint. If you're new to ballet, do not expect to be able to do a full rotation right away. Also, third positions is rarely used anymore as it's considered too similar to fifth position.In the first position, you stand with your legs together and your toes pointed away from your body. You should turn your toes as straight as you can, ideally forming a straight line.The second position is a continuation of the first position. You spread your legs apart slightly, keeping your toes pointed outward.Fourth positions involves pointing your toes inward, so your feet are turned to face each other. Then, cross your legs.Fifth position is a continuation of fourth position. Push your feet slightly closer together., Just as there are different positions for your legs in ballet, there are also different positions for your feet. Spend some time practicing the different placements of your arms if you're interested in doing a ballet routine.  In first position, bend your arms slightly at the elbow and hold them out in front of your body.In second position, stretch your arms out on either side of your body.In third position, keep your arms at your side, but raise one arm up over your head.In fourth position, keep one arm over your head. Bend the other arm inward, as you did in first position.In fifth position, raise both your arms over your head. Keep your elbows slightly bent., A plie (plee-ay) is a basic ballet move. It simply means 'to bend.' Bend your knees, with your feet pointing away from your body. Try to get your knees to bend until they're directly above your toes., Releve (ruh-lee-vey) is a ballet move in which you rise slightly. It can be done using one or both feet. Push your feet together while keeping your knees straight. Lift your heels into the air, transferring your body weight onto the balls of your feet. You should not attempt to stand on the tips your toes without proper training as well as shoes., A saute (soh-tay) is a basic ballet jump in which you use both feet at the same time. Begin with a plie and then use your feet as if you were going to perform a releve. In doing so, jump into the air. Straighten your legs as you jump and then land on both feet.

"The first thing you will need to get hold of to create a great habitat to help you care for your lizard is an appropriately sized vivarium. This is a container, similar to an aquarium, that has a vented lid. This kind of container is ideal for lizards because it enables you to maintain the heat and the humidity your lizard will need to stay healthy. The size of vivarium you need will depend on the number of green anoles you get.  Anoles can be kept alone or in groups of one male and a number of females  A ten-gallon vivarium is big enough for two anoles. If you have two or more male anoles they may fight.If you have one male and two or three females you should get a 20 gallon vivarium or tank. This would be approximately 48' x 13' x 20'.;  , Once you have your tank you need to equip it with all the items your lizard needs for a stimulating and healthy habitat. Start by laying around two inches of sterile potting soil on the base of the tank and cover this with some bark mulch. Then place several potted plants in the tanks. The plants give your lizard opportunities to climb as well as contributing to the humidity.Make sure you only include reptile safe plants. Pothos, spider plants, philodendrons, dracaena, and ficus are all good choices.  You should add some extra branches propped up against the side of the tank. These are great for climbing on. You can buy prepared branches in your pet store.  Be wary of bringing in branches from outside as these may have parasites., You should provide an area within the tank that is kept at a higher temperature than the rest of the tank during the day. This is the basking area where your anole will relax during the day. You should keep this area at around 85-90 Fahrenheit.You will need a secondary heat source for this area. This heat source should not cover more than around 25% of the total space of the habitat.  You could use a 50-75 watt incandescent bulb which you have secured in a ceramic base. The lizard should not be able to reach or touch the bulb itself.  There are also specialist basking lights available from your pet store.  Never use hot rocks as heat sources for anoles., Your lizard will want plenty of places where he can hide away, under logs as well as behind plants and branches. You can create a special hiding house for your lizard just by placing appropriate bits of wood or bark in the tank. It's a good idea to have hiding places in the basking area. You can also buy special hiding houses from your pet store to place into your tank., Anoles are natives of warm regions of the south-east US, and places like Cuba, and the Caribbean. If you have anoles as pets you need to make sure the habitat you construct recreates the kind of temperatures that the lizards would enjoy in the wild. You should try to maintain a temperature of around 75-86ºF / 24–30ºC during the day. At night the temperature should drop to around 65-75 Fahrenheit.You can use heating lamps and thermometers to control and monitor the temperature inside the vivarium.  At night, you can use specialist nocturnal incandescent light bulbs which produce heat, but not much light. These can be expensive.  An alternative is a heating pad which you can place underneath the tank., Your lizard needs exposure to UVB light so he can synthesize vitamin D3 and metabolize calcium. Your lizard needs free access to 8-12 hours of UVB light a day. Insufficient exposure to UVB will lead to mineral deficiencies and physical problems for your green anole. Your lizard will decide when to bask in the light and when to sit in the shade, but you need to make the light available for him.The sun is the best source of ultraviolet light. If this is not practical arrange a combination of visible light from fluorescent or incandescent lights and UVB light from a reptile black light.  UV light will not penetrate glass, so if you are using overhead UVB light sources, the top of the tank will need to be mesh so the light can get through., Anoles will like a habitat that is humid, but not the kind of humidity you would expect from a wet rainforest environment. Aim for a humidity of around 60-70%. You can do this quite simply by ensuring that water is going into the air in the container. You can purchase a water dripper or a mister system which will do this automatically. Be sure to monitor it regularly to check it is working effectively.  An alternative to this is to spray the leaves of the plants in the container with purified water a few times a day.  Lizards are used to drinking water from leaves, so this is also a good way to provide drinking water.  Not all lizards will learn to drink from a bowl so you should ensure that your lizards have another way to access to drinking water, such as the dew on leaves.  ","get a vivarium. add plants and branches. provide a basking area. create hiding areas. get the right temperature. provide uvb light. control the humidity with water. "

"Do not attempt begin taming until it has spent a few weeks getting accustomed to its new environment. Keep the cockatiel in a quiet, calm area.;  , You may say anything you like, as long as your voice stays calm, without sudden changes in volume. Also try to speak softly, not loudly. Lower yourself to just above the cockatiel's eye level if you are taller than its cage, putting yourself in a less threatening position without appearing submissive. Keep this up for a few days before you make any attempt to train the bird.  At some point, now that your bird is used to the sound of your voice, he or she will begin to move toward you when you sit down to talk to your cockatiel. At this point, you can begin to train your bird, but only very slowly., A spray of millet is commonly used to train cockatiels, since the birds are typically enthusiastic about the food, but you may use any cockatiel-appropriate food in small amounts. Hold it through the bars of the cage, but not directly at its face. This encourages the bird to make its way toward you voluntarily. Keep it steady as the bird pecks once or twice, or let it peck for up to five seconds when it demonstrates unusually good behavior.Only use the spray of millet, or whichever treat you chose, as a treat. The cockatiel may be less motivated for training if it can eat the same food without working for it.  Each day, set aside some time to talk to the cockatiel, keep your hand steady near the bird, then give it a treat if it calms down. Spend no more than 10 or 15 minutes per session, one or two times a day, to avoid making cockatiel anxious. At the end of each session, make the cockatiel move closer to your hand before it can get the treat.  Even if a young bird is willing to play with you and appears happy, keep these sessions to no more than 15 minutes, as a young bird needs to return to its cage to eat and rest frequently.  Once the bird is comfortable around you, it will stay calm as you approach it, and may even eat the treat directly from your hand. This may take weeks or months for an adult bird that is not used to close human interaction. Once you've reached this stage, you may convince the cockatiel to leave its cage, although some older birds that did not grow up socialized may not voluntarily do this.  Make sure all windows and doors in the room are closed, and no other pets are present, before you open the cage.  Once the bird will approach you and eat from your hand, start approaching it in a similar way with an empty hand, extending two fingers horizontally. Hold the hand in position until the bird calms down, rewarding a bird with a treat if the cockatiel remains calm. Again, keep these sessions to 10 or 15 minutes, once or twice each day.  Eventually, move your hand directly to the bird's perch, or touch its feet. Once you can keep your hand there without agitating the bird, gently push the bird's lower chest with your fingers. A light nudge should be enough to slightly knock the cockatiel off balance, and cause it to step on your finger with one foot.  Each time the bird starts to step up, say a short command such as 'step up' or 'up.' Praise the bird and give it a small treat when it does this. Praise again when bird steps with both feet. Keep training sessions to a few minutes at a time, making sure to always end on a positive note.  The cockatiel may use its beak to test the stability of your finger. Try not to jerk your hand away when the beak touches your finger.  Once the bird will step onto your finger on command, teach it to 'step down' onto another perch using the same method.Reinforce these behaviors by teaching it to 'ladder,' or repeat the 'step up' command from your left hand to your right and back again.Train the bird to perform these movements daily, until it will do so on command without a treat.  You do not need a special command for laddering. Repeat the 'step up' command instead.  As the training gets more complicated, your bird may have trouble figuring out why you are giving it a treat. Try using a 'clicker,' or make a distinct, short sound by tapping a pen, each time the bird displays good behavior. This gets the bird's attention while you fetch a treat. Once the bird is well trained, you can use just the sound of the clicker or pen as a reward, but until then the treat is still a vital part of the training.  A clicker or other distinct sound is recommended over a verbal command, because it sounds the same each time and is unlikely to be encountered outside of training.  Clicker training remains an excellent tool for training pets. Whenever you start teaching the cockatiel a new command, use a clicker or make a distinctive noise by tapping a pen at the moment it shows good behavior. Fetch a treat immediately afterward, and continue daily training until the cockatiel will respond to the command with just the clicker as a reward.  If the cockatiel is comfortable outside its cage, put it on a white or beige towel on floor each day during its training session. Gradually bring up the corners of the towel, but stop if the bird struggles. Repeat the process each day, rewarding the bird when it stays calm, until you can fully enclose the cockatiel in the towel.This training will make it much easier to bring your cockatiel to the vet, or remove it from a dangerous situation.  Repeat a phrase a few times, with an animated facial expression and tone, at a time when the cockatiel is relaxed and happy. If the cockatiel looks at you and demonstrates a reaction, such as cocking its head or dilating its pupils, it may be interested in that word. Repeat that word frequently, but stop if the cockatiel gets bored. When it attempts to mimic you, reward it with a treat.Male cockatiels can make more sounds than females, since they use more complex calls to attract mates. Female cockatiels can still talk, but the voice may not be as clear.  Most cockatiels can talk around eight months of age, although you can attempt to teach them as young as four months if the bird appears interested.It can be harder to train an adult bird not used to speaking.  While watching the cockatiel, bob your head or rock your finger back and forth to music with a steady beat. When it starts to rock back and forth, reward it with a clicker and a treat. As you continue this training, and find music that gets the cockatiel's attention, it may sway more energetically and raise its wings while doing so.Similarly, whistling during these dance sessions may encourage the cockatiel to make sounds of its own.  If the cockatiel bites you, try to keep your reaction to a minimum. Jerking away violently, responding loudly, or ending the taming session can encourage the bird to bite again. This can be difficult to avoid due to the painful bite, so try to avoid serious bites in the first place by leaving the cockatiel alone when it is hissing, when it has fully extended its head crest, or when its crest is flattened against its head.Wear thick gardening gloves if biting is a recurring problem.  Cockatiels do not typically understand what you are doing when you attempt to punish them. They may enjoy it when you shout at them, return them to their cage, or otherwise react to bad behavior. Focus on praising the cockatiel during good behavior instead, or use mild forms of punishment such as ignoring the bird, or gently withdrawing the jewelry it is nibbling., Many cockatiels will only let you pet their crest or beak, and some dislike any form of petting. Pet slowly, and withdraw slowly if the bird hisses, nips at you, or flattens its crest.  ","stay quiet and unobtrusive around a new cockatiel. talk to the cockatiel from outside the cage. make sure your bird is comfortable with you. offer the cockatiel a treat. repeat this routine daily. open the cage only when the cockatiel is comfortable. continue moving your hand closer during training sessions. get the bird to step onto your finger. encourage the behavior. teach the cockatiel to step down and ladder. consider clicker training. continue using clicker training for additional tricks. teach the cockatiel to be comfortable in a towel. teach the cockatiel to talk. encourage the bird to whistle and dance. try not to react when bitten. don't try to punish the cockatiel. only pet the cockatiel if it remains calm.

"Your own space is your sanctuary. If you live on your own or with other Pagans then you can do up your house with all the trappings and spirit of the holiday. Decorate and fill your living area with all the trimmings that mean something special to you and make you proud and happy to be Pagan at this time of the year. If you live with non-pagans, decorate your own room, or your part of the room festively. It is your space, and any time you feel downtrodden or upset, retreat to your space and surround yourself with happy feelings. Use the area to remind yourself that your religion is just as valid and special as others and carry that joy around with you. It's easier to deal with Nativities or Menorahs at the grocery if you know you have your Yule tree waiting to greet you at home.;  , You have as equal a right to celebrate the holidays of your religion as anyone else does to celebrate theirs. If others are curious, or attacking the Sabbat at hand, explain that this is your religion, and it is as valid as theirs .  If you are going to an event with another holiday as it's central theme, celebrate as cheerfully as you would at your own religion's party. Remember, 'When in Rome...' You don't have to be Christian to sing Jingle Bells with your in-laws, or let your kids hunt Easter eggs at a friend's house. Going with the flow makes things easier when not on the home front. In turn you can invite people to your home and show them a good time, Pagan holiday style- while possibly fostering acceptance and respect for your beliefs.  For instance, on Ostara/Spring or Vernal Equinox the visual symbols are quite similar to those of the more openly celebrated Easter. Luckily, the ancient symbols of fertility and creation translated into this modern holiday. Only you need to know that in your home the bunny has a deeper meaning than candy egg delivery man. At Yule you can send holiday greeting cards with Deer or tree themes as those relate close enough to both the Deer God/Yule tree and Reindeer/Christmas tree. If those you are sending cards to are Jewish, simple but elegant cards with white, silver and blue colors can symbolize the Winter Solstice for you and Hanukkah for them. Samhain is easiest as it has survived most traditionally intact. Although it can require a good sense of humor to not scream and rant about all the horrible images of warty green women.  Religion is deeply personal, so it should make things easier to keep meaningful parts at home than trying to set up a full scale Mabon altar in your cubicle at work. Wearing certain corresponding colors, or jewelry on the Sabbat can make you feel more fulfilled and less like you have something to 'hide'. You can be proud without shoving it down others' throats, or welcoming undue ridicule or questioning in an inappropriate setting. Remember that you are not trying to convert anyone, just celebrate your holiday.  ","make your personal space a pagan haven. do not apologise for your beliefs or sabbats. most holidays are joyous events, you can enjoy any party, regardless of the religion involved. try to see any similarities that can help blend together the festivities. celebrate the deeper spiritual meanings of holidays at home and lighter traditions openly.

"Sikhs often pile their hair on top of their head in a type of bun to keep it under the fabric.  A patka is considered a kid's turban or one that you can wear to play active sports in. Often, Sikhs tie one on under a regular turban as a way to hold it in place, which is why it's first in this article. It is a smaller piece of cloth than a full turban.;  , Begin twisting the hair altogether, making a thick rope of your hair.  Make a knot on the top of your head near the front. Keep wrapping it around itself. If it's long enough, you can pull part of it through itself to form a sort of slip knot. If not, wrap the end around the knot. Secure with an elastic holder if it doesn't want to stay.  Some Sikhs wear a patka under their turbans.  Place it over your forehead, holding a corner in each hand. Tie the corners from the front at the back of your head.  Cross one over and around the knot on your head, holding it under your chin for the moment. Cross the other one around the other way.  Tie them at the back of your hair knot.  ","pull up your hair. pull your hair to the top of your head as if you were making a ponytail there. begin twisting the rope of hair around itself. tie on a patka. start with a patka cloth. pull the corner strings up from the back. wrap the ends around the front of the knot.

"Look for opportunities in a special day class, a resource room, or any other setting where you get a lot of interaction and deal with responsibilities that require working with people with disabilities. Apply to be a para-educator (aka, a teacher's aide, paraprofessional, dedicated student aide, 1 on 1 aide, etc.), or volunteer. Unlike a teaching position, para-educators have a competitive and highly sought-after job, so be prepared to apply to many places and to work as a sub, or part-time.;  , Focus on the disability population you're most interested in working with. In California, there are five major areas you can become credentialed in: Early Childhood Special Education, Mild - Moderate disabilities, Moderate - Severe disabilities, visual impairment, and deaf or hard of hearing.  The degree can be in any field of your choice, though the following list of majors will greatly inform your future teaching practice and prepare you for the type of graduate work you will be doing: psychology, sociology, child development, ethnic studies, and math/English education. If you have a degree in anything else, though, it will probably not affect your chances at having a successful career, just make sure you do at least some work study in the areas of education, psychology, sociology, or any related field.  In many California State Universities (San Jose State, CSU Monterey Bay, CSU Los Angeles, etc.) you'll be able to get a minor in Special Education while you obtain your bachelor's degree, and that can put a significant dent in the intimidating amount of work you'll have to do for your Level I credential. It's recommended that you do as much as you can to lessen the amount of courses you have to take in your graduate level of education.  Only a handful of private schools and UCs, offer credentials in any area of special education. Every CSU offers a preliminary credential program in special education in at least one field (of the mild/moderate, moderate/severe, etc.). Some universities, like San Jose State, or San Francisco State, offer nearly every possible credential and have huge departments of Special Education. Some, like Humboldt State, have only one or two programs. Do your research and determine what you want to do before you decide which you would like to attend.  Passing scores on both tests are required to apply to credential programs.  Get everything in order in advance. Be prepared to apply as early as a full year prior to the start of the program you want, especially since the changes CSUs have had to make do to state budget cuts which means often admissions is limited to the fall term and some programs may have more limited ability to admit students.  If you already have a credential for general education, either multiple or single subject, you'll be able to waive several of the classes and tests required for the Special Education credential. If you don't have a credential already, you can go straight into a special education program.  Keep in mind that a special education credential allows you teach special education in all grade levels K-12, with the exception of Early Childhood which restricts you to Birth - 5 and Moderate - Severe, which allows you to teach adult students up to age 22 in addition to the K-12 grade range.  Don't be fooled into thinking this is 'just' an internship. An internship in Special Education as a teacher is basically doing a full-time regular teaching job but also taking classes full time at your university at the same time. An internship is an excellent way to get into a district, get your first two years out of the way (known to be the most difficult time in a teaching career), and make an excellent salary while you're at it.  Be fully aware that an internship is a lot of hard work (and that's an understatement) but it can be extremely rewarding when you finally get your preliminary credential and realize you've already got two years of experience under your belt.  An intern credential is good for two years, and no longer. You must plan to have all of your classes finished before your internship credential expires.  There are two credentials you'll get, Level I and Level II. After you finish your Level I credential, which will include the majority of your classes, you'll have 5 years in which to finish your Level II (a program which takes 2 years at a comfortable pace) and which includes more courses at a university and a minimum of two full years of teaching experience.  This is done through the university and the Beginning Teacher Support and Assessment - BTSA process that general education teachers complete, but is a little more intense. It can be coupled with a Masters degree in Special Education, which is only one to three classes of extra work along with a masters project, thesis, or seminar. After three and a half years, it's really worth adding one extra semester of work, and most districts will give you a small stipend for having an MA.  You may apply to any university to get your Level II if you choose to move or just try a different college, you do not have to continue at the same university you started at. Your school district will arrange the BTSA portion of your Level II credential with you.  Special education is a field with many more job openings than applicants, as there is a large growth in students receiving special education and quite a bit of teacher turnover. The field of special education offers many employment opportunities for those people who are interested! You'll almost definitely have a job in any place in California, and the job security is unbeatable. If you've ever thought you just might be interested in working with people with special needs, then you'll probably find yourself very happy in this field.  ","start as soon as you can with getting experience. pick a disability population to focus on. get a bachelor's degree. research your credential program. take the cbest (california basic educational skills test) and the cset (california subject examination for teachers) multiple subjects test (if you want to teach in high school you might take a cset single subjects test). apply. meet with a counselor, and figure out your program plan. decide whether you want to do an internship or not. apply for your credential. apply for jobs!

"Fabric dye works best on natural fabrics such as cotton, linen and silk. Synthetics such as rayon and nylon are also good candidates. There are a couple of fabrics that won’t accept dye well – 100% polyester and spandex. Avoid attempting to dye those.  It’s recommended that you don’t attempt to dye the fabric of any garment labelled “dry clean only”.  The different fabrics absorb dye differently from one another, with results that vary in appearance. If you are concerned about a particular garment, test a swatch first.;  , Cover your entire workspace with plastic or newspaper before you begin. Make sure to have sponges and paper towels within reach in case of spillage. Use plastic buckets, stainless steel buckets or a stainless steel sink to create your dye bath.  Don’t use bath tubs made of porcelain or fiberglass for any part of the dyeing process because they will stain.  You will need to be wearing rubber gloves during the entire dyeing and rinsing process., 140°F/60°C is the maximum temperature you can use and will result in the deepest black color. Make sure you use enough hot water to completely submerge your garment.If you want the deepest black and your tap water doesn’t get hot enough, use a stove, teakettle or microwave to heat the water.  Be sure to dissolve it thoroughly and use a chopstick or any other handy tool you don’t mind staining to stir the mixture until well mixed. If you’re using liquid dye, all you need to do is shake it well before adding it to the bucket.  Check the dye packaging to make sure you are using enough dye for the amount of clothing you’re dying. The amount needed varies from product to product, so consult the packaging or insert for exact measurements.  Make sure that the mixture blends well into the hot water. There needs to be enough water in the bucket so that your garment can move around freely and be stirred while in the dye bath. This is so that your garment will get evenly dyed.Add one tablespoon of laundry detergent to the dye bath. This will help promote dye absorption. Make sure that you stir the laundry detergent into the dye bath until it is well dissolved.  When dyeing cotton, rayon, ramie, or linen, add 1 cup of table salt to the dye bath. This will intensify the color.  When dyeing nylon, silk and wool, add 1 cup of white vinegar to the dye bath to intensify the color., The longer your garment is left in the dye bath, the darker the result will be. Garments can be left in the bath for up to 1 hour. You will need to constantly agitate and stir the garment while it’s submerged in the bath.  Try to keep the temperature of the water as consistently hot as possible, so have a stove top, microwave or tea kettle nearby to heat water up to use to refresh the dye bath.  Another option would be to use a large stainless steel pot for the dye bath and go through the process with the pot being heated on the stove to keep a consistent temperature.If you soak your clothing in plain hot water for a few minutes before putting them in the dye bath, it will smooth them out so that they can accept dye even more easily., Warm water removes the dye on the surface of the garment more efficiently. After the warm rinse, then rinse in cold water. Keep rinsing until the water runs clear.  When you remove the items from the dye bath, they will be wet and appear darker than the final result will be.  Turn your items inside out and place them in the washing machine.Wash them alone in warm water with a mild detergent. Use the gentle cycle.  You can dry your items either way, but hang drying clothing preserves their dark colors, so it’s probably a better idea to get in that habit. Once dry, your clothing is ready to wear.  For the first 3 times you wash your newly dyed clothing after wearing, wash the items alone in cold water using the gentle cycle and mild, non-bleach detergent.  After that you can wash the dyed items with other items of the same color that haven’t been dyed, but make sure it’s always in cold water and using a mild detergent.  ","determine if your fabric will receive dye. prepare your workspace. fill your bucket or stainless steel sink with very hot water.the hotter the water, the deeper the color result. pre-dissolve your powder dye in a separate container in very hot water. pour the mixture into your dye bath (the bucket/sink). submerge your garment in the dye bath. remove the clothing from the dye bath and rinse it in warm water first. hang or machine dry the clothing.

"If the ceiling isn't very dirty, simply use a broom covered with a tee-shirt to dust away any dirt. If your ceiling is dirty or greasy, use a sponge to scrub one small section at a time using an all-purpose cleaner.It's important to let the ceiling dry thoroughly before applying your tiles.  A clean surface will make your tiles stick more effectively. You may have trouble attaching them if the ceiling is dirty or has peeling paint. If your ceiling is very greasy, wash it using a mixture of 1 cup ammonia and half a gallon of water.;  , To do this, use measuring tape and record how long the ceiling is. Then measure how wide the ceiling is. Multiply these two numbers to get your square footage.For example, if your ceiling is 12' long and 15' wide, then the square footage is 180.  You'll need to figure the square footage of each tile. Again, multiply the length times the width to get the tile's measurement. Then divide the square footage of the ceiling by the square footage of one tile. This will tell you how many tiles you'll need.For example, if your tile is 24' long and 24' wide (2' by 2'), then the square footage for the tile is 4 (2 multiplied by 2). If the square footage for your room is 180, divide it by 4. You'll need at least 45 tiles.  Always buy 15 percent more tiles than you think you'll need. That way, if you need to cut tiles or make a mistake, you'll have plenty to complete the job., Unscrew any light fixtures, fans, or air vent covers. This will allow you to easily measure tiles and install them without damaging fixtures.  You'll probably want to use a flat-head or Phillips screwdriver to remove fixtures. This is also a good time to give fixtures and vents a quick clean.  ","clean the ceiling. measure the square footage of the room. determine how many tiles you need. remove any fixtures or vents. "
"A two-bag bomb bag is a quick and basic way to make an effective bomb bag. To begin, place one tablespoon (14.78 ml) of baking soda in a Ziploc sandwich bag or a similar small, completely sealable bag., After adding the baking soda to the larger sandwich bag, pour ¼ cup (59.14 ml) of vinegar to a smaller sealable bag like a snack size Ziploc bag. Then seal the zip on the bag completely.Make sure that the snack size bag in which you put the vinegar is smaller than the bag that you put the baking soda in.  Leave a little bit of air inside the snack bag of vinegar, as opposed to pressing it before sealing and letting the air escape.  You need to initially separate the vinegar and baking soda because they react almost instantly, which means that if you poured them in together, you wouldn’t have time to seal the bag before the pressure builds. Adding them in separately ensures that the reaction in the bag will be able to build up to an explosion.  Once you seal the snack bag, place the snack bag of vinegar inside the larger bag of baking soda. Seal the zip on the sandwich bag., Once you seal the larger bag, place the bag on a surface that is either outside or can be easily cleaned. Then hit or punch the snack bag inside the sandwich bag. Because you left some air inside the snack bag, the pressure of your punch should open up the seal of the bag slightly to let the vinegar escape into the larger sandwich bag.If punching the bag doesn’t partially open the seal, use your fingers to try to pinch the sides of the snack bag of vinegar and pull the seal partially open without opening the larger sandwich bag.  Once you have partially opened the seal of the snack bag of vinegar, give the bag a good shake to allow some of the vinegar to escape into the larger, sealed sandwich bag of baking soda. Once you have jiggled the bag and see the vinegar touch the baking soda, toss the bag down onto an easily cleanable surface., After shaking the bag, the vinegar will collide with the baking soda, and you should see the reaction start and the bag start to expand. When the bag has expanded to its fullest extent, it will explode with a loud pop!  ","add a tablespoon (14.78 ml) of baking soda to a sandwich bag. add ¼ cup (59.14 ml) of vinegar to a snack bag. place the snack bag inside the sandwich bag. punch the snack bag to release the vinegar. jiggle the bag and toss it down. watch the explosion.

"Sticking a knife with no rotation is made possible by modifying the standard throwing grip. Wrap your hand loosely around the handle of the knife. Pinch the handle between your thumb and the length of your middle finger. Place your index finger flat against the spine of the blade at the knife’s center of balance. This is known as the “thumb grip,” or sometimes the “drive-finger grip,” as you’ll be using your thumb to guide the movement of the knife and your index finger to drive it forward as you release.The thumb grip is used to neutralize the rotation of the blade after it leaves the hand.  Every knife will have a slightly different center of balance. Locate the knife’s center of balance by laying it across one outstretched finger and adjusting it until it balances on its own. This is the section of the knife on which you should place the point of your finger.;  , Hold your arm straight out in front of you with the tip of the blade trained on your target. Eyeball the exact spot you’re aiming for. Pay close attention to the angle and position of your arm. This is where your arm will need to be at the moment you release the knife.Pointing the knife in the direction of the target before you throw can help muscle memory take over, giving you a sense of exactly where your arm should be when you release.  For better accuracy, make a quick initial lineup part of your throwing ritual.  Keeping your shoulder fixed and your upper arm parallel with the ground, draw the knife back until it’s level with your head. Your elbow should be bent about 90 degrees, with the blade of the knife pointing straight up. Square your stance and take a small step forward with your opposite foot.To get an idea of what position your shoulder and forearm need to be in, hold up your throwing arm as though you were making the “goal” gesture used by fans of American football.  The Mumyou-Ryu technique was derived from a technique used by ancient Japanese warriors to throw circular projectiles (shuriken, or “throwing stars”) without rotation. It was adapted for use with straight, modern knives and spikes., Lean over your front foot as you prepare to throw. Let go of the knife while your throwing arm is at roughly a 45 degree angle—this will help compensate for gravity and create the relaxed arc that the knife will trace in the air. At the moment of release, lightly “brush” the length of the spine with your pointer finger. Straighten your arm so that you complete the throw pointing at your target. With any luck, you’ll hear the thump of a successful stick.Bring your forearm and knife hand down in a circular path, in one quick movement.  Your forearm should stay straight up and down throughout the windup and release.  ","take the proper grip. line the knife up with the target. raise the knife up beside your head. release the knife in a smooth slinging motion. "
"When you’re pregnant, you will have to urinate more frequently than normal. You may feel more pressure in your bladder or even leak a little urine when you cough or sneeze. This is normal! Urinate whenever you feel the urge to in order to help prevent UTIs., Having sex is a common cause of UTIs, because it can cause bacteria to enter into your vagina.Get into the habit of peeing after you have sex. This can help flush out some of the bacteria., Any time you use the bathroom, always wipe from front to back – starting at your vagina and wiping back to your bottom. This will keep your vagina clean, and avoid contaminating your vagina with any bacteria from your anal area., Keep yourself hydrated to dilute your urine and make yourself urinate more frequently, which flushes out bacteria.In general, aim to drink 9 cups (2.2 liters) of fluids daily.Drink more if you sweat a lot, work out, or live in a hot climate.

"It's common to see a smart person radiating an 'I don't care how I look, take me as I am' attitude. Unfortunately, that also suggests that you're bound to be stubborn and that you're committed to looking frumpy or unkempt. Flaunting what you have, both looks and smarts is actually a way of taking care of yourself and presenting the best you have to offer to the world, so taking a negative approach to looking good won't help your own cause. Being sexy and smart can make your life easier if you let it. Analyze the reasoning behind why you choose to present this front to the world and not make the most of your appearance. Some of the reasons may be:  You feel rebellious. You'd like the world to accept you the way you are because you believe ridiculously high standards are set about beauty and that beauty is a way of being objectified. While there is a risk of objectification, it's not a good reason to eschew making the most of your appearance; rather, it's a reason to help show that a good looking person is also a smart person who refuses to tolerate labels and insinuations.  You believe that people will only love you for your intelligence. This is especially likely if you have been told how intelligent you are during your formative years, creating a self-awareness that intelligence is a key definer of who you are. This is especially common in praise-heavy parenting or mentoring that lacks a focus on praising effort and simply praises the trait of intelligence instead. Yes, you are intelligent but that isn't a reason to define yourself by this trait alone, thereby ignoring creating a more balanced and happier self.  You genuinely can't be bothered with all the fashion, beauty and personal care routines. It takes up time, costs money you'd rather spend elsewhere and it draws you into a world that doesn't interest you in the slightest and which, in some cases, you feel superior to. While it is not being suggested you turn yourself into a fashionista and spend your day reading airhead magazines, it is important to realize that it is possible to find a balance in creating a pleasant appearance that doesn't involve oodles of time and money.;  , While you don't have to toss out everything you own, you do need to cast a critical eye over all those items that are letting down your appearance. Baggy, ripped, unclean, dark and dingy items don't deserve a place in your wardrobe. And if you like a certain item of clothing because you know it makes you look good and feel comfortable, focus on getting more of that type, to reduce the time investment needed to work out what to wear each day.  Match clothes a little more carefully. You could organize your wardrobe using Picasa to speed up things. One afternoon spend categorizing your wardrobe will pay off dividends in the future, especially if you update it regularly when purchasing new clothing. Use the online photos to make matching faster and easier (and a lot more like fun than a chore).  Try a few bold colors here and there to brighten up darker clothing. Even a simple but beautifully bright scarf or pashmina can lift an all-black outfit and make you feel good about yourself.  Buy within your favorite color range and style to keep down costs and time. When you know you're wearing what works for you, you won't find it a trial.  Consider tailored clothing. In reality, you only need a few really good items to set off all your clothes. Tailored jackets, dressy pants and a few decent skirts can lift all the other wardrobe items to stellar levels and you'll look amazing. And the beauty of tailored clothing is that it fits you and is unique. It's worth the initial investment; just be sure to get classic colors and cut and to use long-lasting fabrics.  A classy person uses good manners and thinks about others first. Don't act up like everybody else. Talk in a moderate tone, and don't talk unless necessary. Make sure everything you say has some sense of intelligence and thoughtfulness about it but be careful not to keep going on and on just because a topic happens to be your pet passion or peeve. Move about like you have a purpose and with a slight edginess to your strut. Don't forget to smile at appropriate times or else you'll risk being called a snob.  You're not a pushover but you're also not the iron maiden or Thor. Remember that being nice gets you places and people love someone who shows a genuine interest in them. By the same token though, don't overdo the niceness to the point of seeming nosy or cloying. You need to feel the nice vibe, not just pretend it and being nice helps to impress upon people that you're not stuck up about your beauty and smarts but that you're very approachable.  You may love reading enormous tomes of literature, science and math articles and lots of very complex things but these aren't all that life is about. While you're not expected to go out of your way to read fashion or entertainment information, try to keep abreast of some of the most popular news in these areas from time to time. You can do this by quickly glancing through websites, reading magazines and listening to radio, podcasts or the TV. Assuming that things are beneath you will often mean that you're not well versed in what the general population is thinking or creating memes about and that can be really alienating for your own development and sense of community belonging. Remember that you do not have to respond in the same manner as those who thrill to these things but having an understanding of what's interesting people and exciting them can help you to be more compassionate, attuned and involved in society.  Become a knowledge glutton. Read, listen, observe, and remember. The more information you can store in your mind, the more connections you can make. That does not necessarily mean you should spend most of your time reading. You can take an active approach to learning no matter what you are doing. Anyone can watch a cartoon and be none the wiser. A genius can watch a cartoon and think about what kind of animation is used, how the characters are developed, how the plot relates to real life, why the cartoon is popular, and practically write a dissertation discussing various facets of that single cartoon.  Not everyone is 'smart', so cut down on those technical terms and complicated equations and phrases and save them for the right situations where they would be required. This also prevents you from sounding like you're trying to show off. Remember, there will definitely be more situations where you can appropriately prove how smart you are. Just don't force it. You just might turn people away from you because they might feel intimidated.  Also remember that while being IQ smart may be your thing, a lot of people have excellent emotional intelligence (EQ) and this is more important for getting ahead in the world through positive interactions and social- and self-awareness. If you lack EQ, be sure to improve it and to respect the EQ of others you meet through life. A person with good EQ will also sidestep any feelings of superiority or contempt toward others. See improve emotional intelligence for more ideas.  Every kind of genius is different and individual. And every kind of opinion (even if it sounds completely off-the-wall) has something true within it. If you are the first to think of something or the first to see an old problem in a new way, you will encounter many people who insist that you're an idiot, a fool or a dreamer. Expect this to happen but don't take it on board; if you truly believe in what you've realized, discovered or concluded, then keep following it through to its ultimate consequences and helping people understand it better. Remember, the broken record approach eventually works, provided you are persistent. Ironically, once your idea is successful or accepted, you'll be called a genius. Being a genius simply depends on how society's viewing things a the time and geniuses are often way ahead of social time.  Remember, it's okay to set your serious persona aside once in a while. Use your sense of humor to provoke a shake-up in how things are always done and seen. For example, say something ridiculously crazy once in a while, as this breaks the whole routine of strictly calculated speech. And be sure to put away your extra brains and have safe fun occasionally. It's not like you will forget everything you know in just one night out!

"Let your child know how you expect them to behave and contribute while they live with you. Tell them what you expect them to pay for, what household tasks they are responsible for, and what your policies are for guests and curfew.For instance, you might specify that your child can have friends over, but they have to leave before 9 PM.  Have this talk as soon as possible, preferably before your child even moves back home.  Be sure to emphasize that these rules are not meant to control your child. They are meant to make living together easier and more comfortable while also helping them to move forward with their goals.  Ensure that your house rules are clearly defined by putting them in writing. Talk the agreement over with your child to be sure you’re on the same page.Consider including a time component in your rules. For instance, you might agree to let your child live rent-free for three months, but expect them to find a job during that time and pay rent afterwards.  Include consequences for not respecting the house rules. For example, if your child drives your car but doesn’t fill up the gas tank, they might lose their car privileges.  Make sure to specify that you can change the rules at any time.  If you don’t want your child drinking or using drugs in your house, make it clear. Decide what you will do if you discover they are using substances behind your back.Alcohol, marijuana, and other drugs often contribute to failure to launch syndrome. These substances can impair motivation and make mental health problems worse.  Your adult child may try to bend the rules or use your sense of guilt against you. Stay firm, and remember that it’s not your job anymore to keep them comfortable and sheltered. You have a right to make the rules in your own house.Giving in sends the message that you don’t really mean what you say.  For instance, if you told your child that you won’t pay for their cell phone, don’t give them money when they’re broke one month.  Be sure to communicate the rules to other members of the household, such as to your partner, so that everyone is on the same page.  If your adult child becomes abusive or starts engaging in illegal activities, it’s not a good idea to let them live with you. Decide which behaviors you won’t tolerate, and stick to your guns if you feel like your living situation isn’t healthy or safe.If you decide to evict your adult child from your home, then you would need to provide them with a formal eviction notice. You cannot simply call the police and ask to have them removed.  ","communicate your expectations. draw up a plan for household and financial contributions. be firm in your stance on alcohol and drugs. avoid backing down if your child tests your boundaries. consider what circumstances would warrant asking your child to leave.

"Selecting the right kind of pet is key to finding a new “family member.” Before deciding on a particular animal, take several factors into consideration when choosing your new BFF.  Consider your lifestyle. Are you a homebody and someone who likes to spend time gardening in your backyard or lounging on the porch reading or are you hardly at home and tend to travel a lot? Dogs require more care and attention than other pets, such as a cat, reptile or bird so take a close look at how much time you will be able to spend with your pet.  Evaluate your living space. Not only is your time important, but also your space. Do you live in a 600 square foot walk up in the middle of a metropolitan city or is your home set on an acre of land? Obviously smaller animals will do well in smaller spaces, however certain large breeds of dogs may also thrive in small apartments with the right attention and availability to exercise.  Make sure you aren’t allergic. Unfortunately some people are highly allergic to certain types of pets. If you aren’t sure whether you may have pet allergies, visit your physician for a quick and easy allergy test before you set your heart on a specific type of animal.;  , Once you know which type of animal you think would be the best type of companion, do you research to pinpoint the exact breed and place to adopt the pet.  Animal rescue. One of the most rewarding ways to adopt an animal is through a rescue organization. In addition to the Humane Society, numerous animal advocacy organizations throughout the world are dedicated to placing a variety of animals with loving homes.  Private breeder. Some folks prefer to work through a private breeder. Keep in mind that a private breeder may be more expensive and it is important to do your research before settling on a specific breeder. In some cases animals may be in-bred to achieve a certain type of disposition or intelligence level, however in-breeding can present certain health problems--which may present financial challenges.  Adoption through a friend. In some cases a friend or a friend of a friend who can no longer care for an animal may be looking for a loving home. Check online for message boards or classifieds for pet owners looking to place their beloved animal.  One of the best ways to realize the advantages of having a pet versus a significant other is to analyze the benefits.  Unconditional love. Animals are full of unconditional love and adoration--no matter what. Unlike coming home to a possibly grumpy girlfriend or boyfriend, a pet is almost always in great mood, thrilled to see you come through the door every evening.  Total acceptance for who you are. Your pet isn’t going to care that you’ve put on a few pounds or have a gigantic zit--your pet loves you…blemishes and all.  No pressure to “change” to accommodate another person’s standards of a boyfriend/girlfriend. Sometimes a girlfriend or boyfriend may demand a few changes in their significant other’s life. From spending less time with pals to dressing differently, human companions may not be able to help themselves, whereas your pet loves you for who you are.  Never moody or brings drama home. A pet won’t come home and take the stress from work out on you or fly into a depression because his/her best friend stabbed him/her in the back. Pets are no drama, which makes loving them even easier.  Plan plenty of bonding opportunities with your pet by spending time together.  Meet other people who appreciate your type of pet for social interaction. Search for clubs that support your pet appreciation or if you are a dog owner, visit a dog park or check events through your local pet store. If you plan to bring your pet to interact with other pets, check the environment out first and be sure your animal is up-to-date with vaccinations. If you are planning to go to a dog park, make sure it’s clear of dogs that appear to be aggressive. Also, consider a park that has small and large dog sections.  Make sure your “best friend” is always with you whether you are in bed reading or on the couch watching T.V. Have a pet bed or blanket next to your favorite relaxation spot at home. Make sure your best friend is by your side while you relax.  Take a class with your pet for further training. Spend more time with your pet by taking an obedience training class or a course that will help you learn more about the species. Investigate classes through your local vet or pet stores.  ","select the right companion. conduct adoption research. compare the advantage of a having a pet versus a significant other. plan activities and spend time with your pet. "
"Direct sunlight enables more rapid algae growth. Help minimize algae proliferation by keeping your fountain in a shady or covered area.If a completely shaded area is not available, a partially shaded area may still help slow algae growth.  Also consider placing a cover such as an umbrella or awning in the area near your fountain to help provide shade if no natural shade is available.;  , Tap water and even filtered water still have natural impurities present in them. Distilled water has all of the impurities removed, which can help slow algae formation and prevent algae growth.For larger fountains, distilled water is likely impractical. However, adding a good filter where your fountain draws or recycles water may still help remove some impurities.  The best time to start using algae prevention products is right after you have set up or deep cleaned your fountain. Commercial products are available online as well as at home improvement and maintenance stores.If you are concerned about the health and safety of wildlife using your fountain, look for animal-safe products. Most products found in pet stores and hardware stores will be animal-safe, but it is important to check the labels.  Common products include Algae Shield and SeaKlear. If wildlife is not a concern, such as with indoor fountains, a cap of bleach may also work as a preventative measure.  Before applying an anti-algae agent to your fountain, check the manufacturer's instructions to make sure that the product you purchased will not damage your current fountain setup.  Product instructions will vary by product, but often all you need to do is add product to the water on a regular basis to the running fountain.  Changing the water helps eliminate current living algae and prevents buildup in your fountain’s pump system. Completely empty your fountain of old water and allow it air dry before filling the fountain.If possible, rinse down your fountain and wipe away any buildup or residue from the fountain surface as well as any decorative features such as stones before refilling it.  The pump is responsible for cycling water through the fountain, reducing algae's ability to grow. Scrub the pump's parts with a sponge or a firm-bristled toothbrush and distilled water.If you need to open the pump in order to get at interior parts, follow the manufacturer's instructions. All pumps are different, and what works for one pump may not work for another.  The pump cannot function unless it is entirely underwater. Keep the pump submerged to keep water cycling through and prevent algae from building and growing on the surface.It is common to have to add water to your fountain for the first several days after setting it up in order to ensure the pump stays submerged.  Your fountain should receive a deep cleaning every two months. Turn off and drain the fountain and wipe it down with a fountain cleaning solution, which may be available from a speciality retailer or online, or dish soap.Opt for dish soap if you are looking for a product that is friendly for animals such as birds and small mammals that may make use of your fountain.  Go over the fountain with a toothbrush to scrape off algae and other organic matter.  Be sure to thoroughly rinse the fountain after using soap, as it may damage the fountain if left on its surface.  Clean the fountain's tubes using pipe cleaners, such as can be found at any hardware or craft store, to scrub out the pipe interiors.  If you find that your fountain has developed noticeable algae, the first thing you need to do is thoroughly scrub the individual components of your fountain. Take your fountain apart and clean each surface using soap and hot water and allow to air dry before reassembling.Wipe down the fountain with distilled white vinegar or a solution of 1 cap of bleach per gallon of water before soaping and rinsing the fountain. Rinse bleach thoroughly.  Unlike preventative treatments, algaecides are meant to kill off existing algae growths within a fountain. Algaecides are available in home improvement stores as well as online and specialty retailers.Check the algaecide bottle to see how to properly use the product. Check the bottle to see how much product should be added to the water and at what frequency.  Non-metallic algaecides work better in fountains as they are less likely to stain.  If heavy algae growth continues for extended periods in your fountain, consider replacing the pump to get better water movement and circulation. You may be able to do this yourself, or you may want to call in an expert depending upon the size of your fountain and your level of experience.Fountain pump systems can differ greatly. Check with your manufacturer to see what components your fountain requires.  ","place your fountain in the shade. use distilled water. use a preventative product. change your fountain water monthly. clean your water pump. submerge the pump. deep clean your fountain. scrub your fountain. use an algaecide. replace your pump.

"The indoors vs. outdoors debate basically boils down to one question: Do you want to emphasize the minute details of the insect itself, or do you want to capture it as a living creature in its habitat? Only you can decide, and of course there’s no rule that says you can’t take pictures both indoors and outdoors.  Indoor photography gives you near-total control over positioning, lighting, color contrasts, background details, and so on. With the compliance of the bug (either by fortune or by force), you can essentially capture the precise shot you’ve envisioned beforehand.Outdoor photography takes many of these potential variables out of your hands, but even a blurred natural environment backing your image of the insect can impart a sense of vitality, motion, and even personality., Bugs are even worse than small children when it comes to sitting still for pictures. As a result, some insect photographers prefer to work with bugs that are deceased, whether found that way or brought to their demise for this purpose. Others, however, prefer live subjects and may find it abhorrent to kill a living creature to take a picture of it.  To make living bugs a bit less lively, some photographers will chill them in the refrigerator for twenty minutes or so first. This can be particularly effective with flying insects; however, some people see this as an inhumane practice as well.If you prefer the thrill and challenge of catching shots of a lively insect, don’t mind lots of failed attempts, and prefer not to make your living subject uncomfortable (or dead), shooting active bugs in nature may be for you., Obviously, you want the fine details of your subject insect to stand out as much as possible. For some photographers, this means staging shots on monochrome backgrounds — for instance, placing the bug in a bright white casserole dish.Black backgrounds can also be very striking.  Especially when outdoors, look for vivid contrasting colors, like a pale blue butterfly perched on a deep pink flower. This is an effective backdrop even if the flower becomes blurred with the focus on the bug., No matter what equipment you have, no matter where you take the photo, and no matter what insect you’re shooting, you simply have to get close — really close — to take effective pictures. Proximity is the most reliable form of magnification there is.  If you’re taking pictures of bugs in action outdoors, you’ll have to work on your stalking skills. Yes, this will entail quietly creeping in close, possibly while crawling through tall weeds or scrub grass. Think of it as part of the adventure.  ","choose your photo environment. capture bugs dead, lethargic, or alive. think about color and contrast. get as close as possible. "
"A pulse oximetry test can give the saturation of oxygen in your blood by transmitting light through your tissues. It You may need to have your blood oxygen level tested prior to surgery or other medical procedures, or if you have certain conditions, such as:Sleep apnea  A heart attack or congestive heart failure  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  Anemia  Lung cancer  Asthma  Pneumonia  Cystic fibrosis  A current or possible need for mechanical ventilation to support your breathing  , The pulse oximetry method of measuring blood oxygen level is non-invasive, so there is usually little you need to do to prepare for the test.However, your doctor will still discuss the test with you and answer any questions you may have.  You may be asked to remove fingernail polish, if applicable.  Your doctor may give you other specific instructions for preparation, based on your medical condition and history.  There are very few risks associated with pulse oximetry.These are minimal, but include:  Skin irritation at the application site. This may occur with prolonged or repeated application of the probe sensor.  Inaccurate readings in cases of smoke or carbon monoxide inhalation.  Your doctor can let you know if there are any additional risks, based on your specific medical condition.  The sensor used to measure the oxygen level of blood by pulse oximetry is a clip-like device called a probe.The probe sensor contains a light source, a light detector, and a microprocessor. The light emitted from the source on one side of the clip passes through your skin and reaches the detector on the other side of the clip. The microprocessor does calculations based on the information received from the detector in order to calculate the oxygen level of your blood with a very small margin of error.  Usually, a finger, ear, or nose is chosen as the site to attach the sensor.The sensor will then use light to measure the oxygen level of your blood.  This method has the advantage of being painless and noninvasive, since no needles are involved.However, it is not as accurate as an arterial blood gas test, so in some cases, both tests may need to be performed.Your health professional cannot attach the sensor to an area with excessive movement or tremor, or with bruising.For example, if you have a dark bruise under your fingernail, your health professional may place the sensor on your ear instead.  The sensor’s microprocessor will compare the transmission of two wavelengths of light, red and infrared, as they pass through the relatively thin skin of your finger, ear or other site.Hemoglobin in your blood that has absorbed oxygen absorbs more infrared light, while hemoglobin lacking oxygen absorbs more red light. The sensor calculates the difference between these two values to provide information for deriving your blood oxygen level., If you are having your blood oxygen level measured for a one-time reading, then once the sensor has taken the necessary measurements and completed its calculations, the probe can be removed.In some cases (such as for certain congenital heart conditions), however, your doctor may require you to wear the probe for continuous monitoring.If you are asked to do this, remove the probe sensor only when your doctor tells you to.  Most of the time, there are no special restrictions following the pulse oximetry test, and you can immediately return to normal activities. Depending on your individual medical condition, however, your doctor may give you special post-procedure instructions.  Once your doctor has the results of your pulse oximetry test, he or she will review them with you.An oxygen saturation level of about 95% is described as normal.Your doctor will discuss the implications of your test results with you, including how certain factors may alter the results of the test, including:  Decreased peripheral blood flow  Light shining on the oximetry probe  Movement of the test site area  Anemia  Abnormal warmth or coolness at the test site area  Sweating at the test site area  Recent injection of contrast dye  Smoking tobacco  ","contact a health professional to receive a pulse oximetry test. prepare for the procedure. know the risks. have your health professional prepare the sensor. have your health professional attach the sensor to your body. let the sensor perform a reading. remove the probe. follow post-procedure instructions. interpret the results.

"Use your favorite shampoo to clean your hair.;  , Be sure your hair is ready to style by fully conditioning it.  You may want to use a leave-in conditioner or other product that is specifically designed to deeply condition natural hair, or you can just use coconut oil.  Use a comb to work conditioner through hair and gently remove any tangles.  Your hair should be damp, but not wet, before styling. You may want to keep a spray bottle of water handy during styling to re-dampen hair as you progress.  Hair that is too wet will take longer to dry.  Hair that is too dry will not twist together properly.  More sections and smaller twists will create a better twist out. , Be sure to twist in the direction of the hair’s natural curl: don’t fight nature! Within one of the sections, separate a small square of hair.  Divide the square into 2 strands and twist them around each other, allowing each strand to twist on itself as you twirl the strands together.  Repeat, dividing and twisting one square at a time until each section is fully twisted.  Leave the 2-strand twist in at least one day, but up to three weeks.  You may want to mist the twists daily to maintain their appearance if you are leaving them in for an extended amount of time.  Give your hair enough time in the twist to dry, and start with a discreet twist in the back in case you untwist and determine that the hair needs longer to dry.  Re-apply as-needed during the twist-out process. If hair seems dry or becomes tangled, massage with coconut oil to work the strands apart.  Slowly rotate each twist in the opposite direction that they were twisted to separate the strands. You may work from root to tip or from tip to root, depending on your preference.  Each strand should spring back into an individual curl when you have separated it from its twist partner.  , Wear a sleep cap, a satin scarf, or sleep on a satin pillowcase to maintain your style. , This optional step creates more work, but it enables the twist out to last much longer.  The twist out will maintain its shape longer in dryer and cooler climates. You may want to try another style in hot, humid weather.  ","cleanse your hair as usual. perform a deep condition on your hair. dampen your hair. separate your hair into 4-6 sections using a wide-toothed comb. use a 2-strand twist technique to prepare for a twist-out. allow the twists to set. be sure your hair has dried fully. rub coconut oil or another conditioner on your hands. separate the twist strands. allow separated strands to re-curl individually. apply conditioner or product to roots of twist outs to maintain shape and conditioning. , protect your style at night. re-twist your twists at night. avoid excessive heat or humidity if possible.

"Many of the commercially available home-cleaning solutions are highly effective. They can keep your shower door, tiles and drain all sparkling and flowing perfectly. On the other hand they often contain hazardous chemicals and can cause respiratory problems (acute and chronic), headache, and allergic reactions.A number of common non-toxic materials can be used to make your own effective and safe cleaner.  Many companies do not list ingredients. Look for labels like 'Warning,' and 'Cautious.' Those with the words 'Poison' and 'Danger' are the most likely to cause you health problems if not used safely.Always read products instructions, and use them as the manufacturer intended. This will keep you safe and your bathroom clean.  There is also a number of plant-based, non-corrosive, and environmentally friendly products available for purchase.;  , A number of cheap, effective products are available at hardware, convenience, and cleaning stores. For serious soap scum—maybe in an apartment that wasn't cleaned before or neglected for a while—these may be necessary.  If your products contain chlorine or ammonia you're at risk for respiratory sickness and irritation to the skin, eyes, nose, and throat.Make sure air can flow through the room. Wear a rag, mask, or ventilator over your mouth and nose.  Wear gloves to protect your skin from contact with any hazardous chemicals.  In a waterproof container, like a pitcher or larger measuring cup, pour in one half cup of baking soda. Next add a small amount of water and mix the two thoroughly. You want a paste-like consistency.If your solution seems watery, add more baking soda. If it's chalky and still dry in some bits, add small amounts of water and mix completely to get a smooth paste.  Baking soda, sodium bicarbonate, is a mild alkali and so when mixed with water is really good at dissolving dirt and grease. It is also a natural deodorizer and will cut some of the smell in your bathroom.Look at the size of your shower doors. Depending on how big they are, you will want to make more or less of your cleaner.  Pour one cup of white distilled vinegar in a glass container. Consider the size of your shower doors and decide whether you need more or less. Vinegar is acidic by nature and kills fungus, germs, and bacteria which makes it a great cleaner.Although effective on its own, many online cleaning enthusiasts recommend mixing equal parts dish soap into your solution.In this case you will want to warm your vinegar in the microwave first. This will help the soap dissolve.  Adding a few drops of essential oil can bring a nice new fragrance into your bathroom. Some, like tea tree oil, are antimicrobial and will help clean.Vinegar will also help prevent streaks in your glass., Spray bottles, sometimes called atomizer bottles, can be purchased at hardware or home remodeling stores, and florists. If you want to save some money look for better deals online.  It's also possible to dunk a sponge in either of the non-toxic solution, and then rub down your shower doors.  The warmth and humidity will make it easier to remove any soap scum.If you don't want to take a shower, simply let the water run with all entrances to the room closed.  Shake the bottle before spraying to make sure the solution is coming out properly mixed. Coat the interior and exterior of your shower doors, from top to bottom, hitting all areas you want to clean.Remember to keep the space well ventilated if you are using a commercial product with toxic chemicals. Keep all windows and doors open for several hours after cleaning and don't use more of the product than is necessary., If you use a sponge, dunk it and begin scrubbing. Start on the exterior of the doors and work around; then clean the interiors.  Look for areas where your shower doors might overlap. Remember to wipe down those areas as well.  An added benefit of scrubbing is that it will help remove tougher patches of scum and grime.  Depending on how long it's been since the last time they were cleaned, you will want to wait longer.  Use a sponge that hasn't absorbed any of the baking soda, vinegar, or other cleaner and wipe down all the surfaces. Wash until there isn't any cleaning solution left on the doors.  Finish by wiping all remaining water with paper towels to completely dry the doors. This is especially important if you choose to add a rain-repellant.  Keeping one squeegee specifically for the shower is a good habit. Regularly squeegeeing in the doors and walls after every shower will prevent the same soap scum from building up. And over time you will have to do less cleaning.  Squeegees will prevent hard water stains.  If you don't want to use a squeegee, microfiber towels are also well suited for glass walls and doors. Wring it out when it's gotten full of water, then continue to use it just the same.  If your shower has sliding doors, then it also has metal tracks; soap scum and grime often collects here. If there are holes in the metal tracks, plug them up with paper towel or scrap cloth, then pour in your chosen solution to sit. It is suggested you let this sit overnight.In the morning, you can soak anything up with a sponge or rag, and then wipe the tracks down with water and a sponge.  Wash thoroughly all the rags, sponges, and cloth you used in this step, as well as anything that came in contact with toxic chemicals.  Ensure the doors are completely dry and clean. Spray the product of your choice on all surfaces of your shower door. Wait three minutes and then wipe it all off using paper towels.  Commonly used on car windows to make rain-water bead off more effectively, water-repellants will help in your bathroom too. Less moisture will be able to collect and therefore soap scum and grime will take longer to build up.  For best results, do this once a week., Although this may seem tedious to do all the time, it will help you in the long run. Consistently using a squeegee will keep water off the doors and prevent soap scum from building up too quickly.Using a squeegee makes your walls and doors dry faster. This will prevent mold and mildew from growing.  Some companies make squeegees that mount directly on shower walls.  Owning a squeegee can be handy in other ways. Consider using it to maintain car windows, and windows around the house.  When condensation sits in a closed space it is more difficult to evaporate off. Keeping the bathroom ventilated will prevent condensation build-up and help keep shower doors soap scum free.Proper ventilation in the bathroom also promotes general hygiene and a cleaner airspace in the room.  If you live in a cold climate, close the door and leave any windows open so the room can aerate without lowering the whole house's temperature.  ","consider whether you want to use commercial, non-toxic, or homemade cleaners. buy a commercial cleaning solution. prepare a baking soda based solution. prepare a vinegar-based solution. pour your non-toxic solution into a spray bottle. take a hot shower. spray down your dry shower doors. rub down the shower doors with your solution. let your solution sit for 10 - 30 minutes. wash down the doors with a watery sponge. squeegee all moisture from the shower doors. fill the metal tracks with your chosen solution. coat your shower doors with a rain-repellant. regularly squeegee your shower doors. leave windows and doors to the bathroom open.

"In practice, you likely made note of the five-player unit that worked together the best. Getting off to a fast start is important in basketball, so make sure you have the optimum lineup on the floor for the opening tip. You can tinker with it as the game progresses.  Some days, a player just doesn’t play well. Other times, certain players tire more quickly than usual. Keep an eye on these developments and adjust accordingly. If your best shooter misses his or her first 7 attempts, try having someone else take the shots. If your center looks gassed running up and down the court, give a quick hook and get him or her a breather.  You’re probably going to be talking to your players a lot over the course of the game, so make sure everyone can hear you, especially when the action takes place on the far end of the court. Leave no doubt as to what you want your players to do.  If you’re winning late, run longer possessions to chew time off the clock. If you’re behind late, quicken the offensive tempo and try to score quick baskets. If you have a one-sided lead, give all of your players a chance to see the floor (something you should be doing regardless of the score if you’re coaching in a non-competitive league). Tighten the defense on players who are making a lot of shots. Get the ball to your hot shooters. Adjust appropriately to any situation, and you’ll increase your chances of success.

"It’s no surprise that coffee contains caffeine that will help you feel more alert, but overindulging in caffeine can make you feel sluggish and drowsy. To feel more alert without being too jittery or suffering from sleeplessness, restrict your intake to 2 to 3 cups per day.People react differently to caffeine, so cut back if you start feeling nervous, experience stomach upset, or think the coffee might be disturbing your sleep.Research indicates that up to 400 milligrams of coffee per day, which is equivalent to about 4 cups of coffee, is safe for healthy adults.When you drink coffee, stay away from sugary options that will leave you feeling sluggish and out of it when the sugar high is over.;  , Dehydration can cause you to feel draggy and less alert, so drink water throughout the day to remain hydrated and more aware of your surroundings.If you feel less alert, try to drink one to two glasses of water right away.  Pass up sugary drinks such as sodas, energy beverages, and sweet juices that will cause an energy crash soon after consuming.  When you take deep breaths, you lower your heart rate and blood pressure and improve your circulation. This will increase your energy level and mental focus so you can be more alert. Try this basic exercise you can perform anywhere:Sit up straight. Place one hand on your stomach, just beneath your ribs. Place your other hand on your chest. Try to inhale through your nose. You should feel your stomach pushing your hand outward. Try to keep your chest from moving. Now, pretend you are whistling and breathe out while pursing your lips. Perform 10 repetitions as needed.  Your ballet instructor was right when he or she emphasized the importance of excellent posture. Slouching and adopting poor posture can cause fatigue and make you less alert.  If you are seated, make sure your shoulders are back, your eyes are facing straight ahead, and your butt is touching the back of the chair. Try not to hunch over your desk or computer., If you are feeling groggy and less than alert, try taking a quick 10 to 20 minute power nap.A short nap won’t negatively impact your sleep schedule that night, and you should wake up feeling more alert.  If you have trouble napping, just rest with your eyes closed for 10 minutes. You can still enjoy the benefits of a power nap.  If you are having a hard time being alert, try chewing a piece of gum. Some research indicates that this can help you feel more awake and energized., If you are at home or driving and need to feel more alert, turn on your music and sing along.Singing forces you to manage your breathing, while providing a boost of energy.  This exercise might not be appropriate for a workplace environment, so wait till you are in a place where people won’t file a noise complaint.  Essential oils are often used to provide health and mood benefits, and lemon oil is one essential oil that leaves people feeling more alert and energized.

"Be sure to brush your long locks before going to bed each and every night, as well as every morning. This may sound like a pain but the benefits far outweigh the sacrifice. Just make it a part of your daily/nightly ritual and you're all set.Use a good brush. Ones that have wide teeth are the best. They don't necessarily have to be pricey either.  Keep in mind that certain hair types like Afro-textured natural hair, should only be detangled once a week or so, instead of daily.  Chemically laced products wreck havoc on hair and are just bad all around. Chemicals usually dry out hair which eventually causes tangling. Using them occasionally is one thing but if you use them often you are asking for trouble.  Using a leave-in conditioner will usually do the trick of counteracting chemical damage. This helps coat the open cuticle and makes it “slippery,” so your hair will glide through itself instead of getting caught and tangled.  Sleeping with your hair up in a bun, for example, will help contain your tresses when you're tossing and turning all night. Use a non-elastic hair tie to prevent breakage as well.

"Even if you wash your hair once every day, it could still take several weeks or even months to get the Kool-Aid out. Try washing your hair a couple of times each day instead. If you wash your hair more frequently, though, you should use normal shampoos or moisturizing formulas to prevent your hair from drying out too much.;  , If you only wash your hair once every day or less, try a clarifying shampoo. These shampoos are formulated to strip your hair of foreign build-up, including hair dyes like Kool-Aid. It will not remove the Kool-Aid immediately, but a clarifying shampoo will help fade it faster. Most importantly, the majority of clarifying shampoos are approved for daily use.

To increase the effectiveness of an anti-dandruff shampoo against Kool-Aid, mix it with a little baking soda and apply it to wet hair. You may need to do this several times, but it should help to fade the dye much faster than normal shampoo.  Laundry detergent and dish soap can both remove hair dye, including Kool-Aid, but they also have the potential to severely dry out and damage hair, so they should be used sparingly.

"If you don't have a roasting rack, you can cook the ears of corn directly on the oven rack. Do not coat the oven rack with nonstick cooking spray, but thoroughly clean it before and after roasting the corn.  Place the roasting rack on the middle shelf of the oven, and bake the corn for approximately 30 minutes, or until it is tender and cooked through.  Note that you should keep the husks on the corn when using the roasting technique. Do not husk the corn before cooking it.  The exact amount of cooking time will vary depending on the size of the ears and the level of doneness you prefer. You should begin checking the corn after 25 minutes. Continue checking it every 5 to 10 minutes after that, cooking the corn up to 45 minutes if needed.  Remove the finished corn from the oven. Let it cool slightly, then peel away the husks.

"To perform a full body scan meditation, set aside about 30 minutes. Pick a comfortable location, and lie down so that your back is flat.Make sure your phone, computer, and television are off so you can concentrate on the meditation.  Your bed or a yoga mat are good places to perform this exercise.  It can also help you relax if you dim the lights and take off your shoes. Some people also find it helpful to close their eyes.  Before you officially start the scan, pay attention to the parts of your body that seem tense or painful. When you identify these areas, try to relax or soften your muscles.Holding tension in these areas will prevent you from being fully relaxed and enjoying as much benefit from the body scan.  Pretend you are checking in with different parts of your body, and pay attention to how these parts feel. Focus on one part at a time.For example, if you start with your foot, observe how different parts of the foot touch the mat, your bed, or the floor. Do certain parts of your foot feel different from the rest? If you are wearing shoes or socks, think about how these feel against your feet.  Many people find it helpful to start with their toes and move toward their head. You can also start with your head and work toward your toes.  When you finish reflecting on a body part, allow yourself to move on to another. Work your way to the top of your head.Don’t feel rushed or worry about the time. You don’t have to spend a specific amount of time on each body part. Just give yourself long enough to scan how each part feels.  It can be challenging to eliminate distractions such as negative thoughts, the sound of traffic, or a radio in another room, but don’t let these intrude on your meditation.Allow negative thoughts and distractions from the world around you to fade away. If you find yourself getting distracted during the scan, don’t feel bad. Knowing when you become distracted is a beneficial part of the exercise because you will be better able to prevent this from occurring in the future.  Don’t feel like you are judging your body during the scan. Instead, you are observing how it feels and works.  After you’ve scanned each body part, try to be aware of how they connect to one another at your joints. Notice how these connections feel., As a final part of the scan, think about how your skin feels.Are certain parts cooler or warmer than others? Can you feel different textures from clothing, sheets, or the mat?  , Now that you’ve fully scanned your body, try writing about your experience in a notebook or journal.Do you feel less pain or tension in certain areas?  What worked well with the exercise? What parts of the body scan seemed less effective? Were there moments when you felt distracted? What distracted you? How could you avoid these distractions in the future?  , Repeat this exercise as often as you would like to relax your body. The more regularly you perform a body scan, the easier it will be to maintain your focus and achieve the most benefit.  ","get prepared. identify the parts of your body that seem tense. start a mental scan of your body. continue with the scan. eliminate distractions. focus on connections between body parts. pay attention to how your skin feels. reflect on your meditation. repeat as needed.

"Many band and tour managers were once musicians themselves. If they were not, then they attended concerts and other music industry events regularly.;  , Apply for an internship or entry-level job with a music label or in music public relations. Most people start as an intern and earn their way into an entry-level job in the company.  It is not absolutely necessary to work for a music company in order to work as a band tour manager, since you can be hired directly by bands. However, it will give you important industry knowledge that will help you work with third parties, such as venues, roadies, opening acts and more.  A tour manager is essentially an event planner who is constantly juggling events in different towns.  Consider enrolling in an arts management or music management program. Many schools in the US and Canada offer these programs, but you may need to relocate in order to take advantage of a program that you like.  Consider enrolling in an events management associate's degree program. You will need to be able to do scheduling, budgeting, travel arrangements, money management, planning and public relations in small degrees every day. If you are not good with handling money, take business courses.  Band tour managers must be extremely social and able to field phone calls throughout the day and night. They also must be assertive to be successful.  You will be required to enforce contracts and ask for money from venues and promoters. You will also need to act in a 'parent' role with the band, so that you can earn their respect and be an authority figure. Some ambivalent, but social, parts of the job include breaking up fights and living within a very close environment, such as a bus, with the band.  You are more likely to earn a gig as a tour manager if you are in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Austin, New York City or Nashville. This is only necessary when you are looking for jobs, since you will need to be on the road once you start managing tours.  You are never too young to start making industry contacts, so introduce yourself as someone interesting in managing an upcoming tour.  If you don't feel as though you can jump right into tour management, contact tour managers and volunteer to assist them for free. Volunteer 2 weeks to a couple of months of your time, and the extra expense may result in important contacts and valuable experience.  Try to learn on a small, state-wide tour. Then, once you are familiar with the process, you can start moving into regional, country-wide or international tours.  Being a tour manager often includes making the travel arrangements. For this reason, it is a good idea to start where you know the best way to get a good deal and work your way into new areas. You may also need to learn about venues in promoters in different regions, which is where your music industry knowledge will come in handy.  You will be asked to take on aspects of band management and publicity on some tours, while during others you will simply get the band from 1 place to another. Clarify what the band, the label and the manager want before you take the job, so that you have a better chance of succeeding.  ","develop a passion for music. get a job in the music industry. receive applicable training. hone your social skills. move to a music hub. begin networking as early as possible. find a mentor. start with smaller band tours. understand that each tour management gig will be different.

"Use a leather cleaner to remove dirt and oil before you begin your repair. Use a small pair of scissors to trim any long fibers hanging from the surface. Leave loose fibers that are shorter, or that you can’t access with the scissors, as they won’t interfere with your repair.You can purchase leather cleaner, binder, filler, and sealer separately or together in a professional repair kit. You can find the products you’ll need online or at your local home improvement store.  Apply a small amount of leather binder to a clean, dry sponge, then coat the entire affected area. Check the product’s label for instructions about drying time, and allow it to dry completely before applying the next coat. For best results, apply 8 to 10 coats of binder to the scratched surface., Use a 1200 grit sandpaper to lightly sand the area where you’ve applied the binder. Use gentle, circular motions. Sand until you’ve created a smooth, even surface across the area undergoing repair.Blow away any residue or wipe the surface using a microfiber towel after sanding.  Use a palette or putty knife to spread a thin layer of filler over deep scratches or gouges in the surface. Wait 20 to 25 minutes for the filler to dry. Apply as many coats as you need until the scratches or gouges are level with the surrounding surface., After applying filler and letting it dry, sand the surface once more with a 1200 grit sandpaper. Use an alcohol-based leather cleaner to wipe down the repaired area, then give it several minutes to dry.The cleaner will remove any residue and prepare the leather for recoloring.  If its container doesn’t come with an applicator, use a clean, dry sponge to apply a thin layer of leather colorant. Let it dry according to its instructions before applying additional layers. When you’ve colored and blended the repaired area, apply three to four thin layers of a leather sealer for a robust, flexible finish.

"Some industrial-strength adhesives bond in seconds. E6000 takes longer to “cure” at about 24 hours, but will still be tacky within minutes. Don’t panic if you realize that you have accidentally glued your skin or two fingers together. You can try to weaken the bond with solvents or even warm water.  Don’t try to pull your fingers apart if they are glued together. You may tear the skin.  If you have accidentally applied E6000 to your lips, eyelids, eyeballs, or other sensitive body parts, seek immediate medical attention.;  , Warm water and soap will loosen the bond and is less likely to aggravate your skin than chemical solutions. Fill a basin with warm water, adding soap and working it into a lather.Soak your fingers, hands, or whatever area has bonded until the glue weakens. This may take 15 minutes or more.  Then, begin to rub the area gently back and forth. Continue rolling it until the bond breaks. Again, do not try to pull the glue bond apart.  You can also use a tool like a pencil, spatula, or spoon to jimmy the glue loose.  Mild solvents will dissolve adhesives like E6000 and superglue and should work in case simple soap and water fail. You should be able to find acetone in common household products like nail polish remover or paint thinner.Take a Q-tip or cotton swab and dab it in a small amount of acetone. Then, wet the glue where it has bonded to your skin.  The solvent should soften the glue. Begin to work the glue back and forth once it is loose and gently peel the skin away from the glue, without pulling.  Acetone can irritate the eyes, skin, and lungs. Use it in a well-ventilated area and avoid swallowing or bringing it into contact with your eyes. Wash your hands with soap and water after you have removed the glue.Acetone will also discolor fabrics and damage finishes. Take care to keep it away from your clothing and surfaces like countertops and floors., If soap and water and acetone fail, or are not available, try a petro-based cleaning product like Goo-Gone. Goo Gone contains methyl alcohol but also the solvents toluene and acetone, so it should be able to dissolve even heavy-duty glues.  Apply the liquid solvent to the affected area with a cotton swab or blot it with a cloth.  Wait one or two minutes, and then start to work the glue back and forth.

"This is the very first step. At this early stage, don't be too concerned about the story. Your goal here is to generate as many fresh ideas as you can. Don't worry too much about the quality of the ideas. An idea that appears good now may turn out to be a really bad idea later on. Write your ideas down so that you can go back and pick one to write on later.;  , For content to be interesting, you need to pick a topic that is fresh. Everyone likes novelty. It's easier to create interesting content when you are writing about a cool mobile gadget that is about to be launched in the near future. You can, of course, with good writing skills, turn a mundane topic into something interesting. But that requires more effort and skill. Imagine having to write about doing the dishes. How interesting do you think your article will be?  , Too many writers try to impress their readers. As a result, they use flowery words or jargon that very few people can understand. Having a wide vocabulary is great. But misusing that range is never a good idea. Always strive to communicate your ideas clearly. This applies to all forms of writing - press releases, blogs, and even novels.  If you want your writing to come to life, be as descriptive as you can. Being descriptive is especially useful for fiction writers. Having all those little details simply allow the reader to paint a more vivid image in his or her mind.  Be clear about your target audience. Who are you writing for? If your writing is meant for the general public, then make it easy for everyone to understand. Use short sentences and simple words. If you are promoting your corporate website using a press release, write in a formal style.  Nobody likes to read stale content. If you are having difficulty having original ideas, start by stating your own opinions.  There are often opportunities for a writer to let the reader get a sense of who you are. Let your writing reflect your personality.  If you are making an argument in your article, try to back up your argument with facts and figures. Concrete statistics can help bring credibility to your writing.  If you are borrowing content or ideas from an external source, be sure to cite all sources at the end of the article. It's about respecting the rights of other writers. Being respectful makes the Internet a much nicer space for everyone.

"The plaintiff will start the lawsuit by filing a complaint in court. This complaint describes who the parties are, what facts gave rise to the lawsuit, and the requested remedy (usually money damages). You will receive a copy of the complaint. You should read it closely to discover the alleged abuse:  Direct abuse against a resident. You can be sued for assaulting, confining, physically punishing, or intimidating the patient. You can also be sued for depriving the resident of essential food, water, or medicine.Failure to supervise. If you own or manage a nursing home, you can be liable for any abuse committed by your employees. The theory is that you were careless in your staffing, training, supervising, or use of background checks.;  , You will receive a summons along with the complaint. The summons should describe the deadline for responding to the lawsuit.Pay close attention to this deadline. If you fail to respond in time, the plaintiff could get a default judgment against you. With a default judgment, the plaintiff can put a lien on your property or garnish your wages—all without you being able to defend yourself.  A nursing home abuse lawsuit is serious. You could pay a considerable amount of money if you lose at trial. Also, assaulting a resident is a crime for which you could be prosecuted. For these reasons, you need to meet with a qualified attorney to discuss your case.  If you don’t have a lawyer, then you can get a referral from your local or state bar association.Ask for a personal injury defense attorney.  Consider hiring the lawyer. The plaintiff probably has an attorney. (Double check by looking at your copy of the complaint. If it is signed by a lawyer, then the plaintiff has an attorney.) You will be at a serious disadvantage if you do not have one.  If you are a certified nurse’s aide or other employee, you might not be able to afford a lawyer. However, you should certainly meet with an attorney for a consultation. Many lawyers provide free or reduced-price consultations.  You can also ask the lawyer if you can hire him or her to perform only discrete tasks. For example, you might try to handle the pre-trial aspects of the lawsuit yourself but hire a lawyer to represent you in court. Ask any attorney you are referred to if they offer this kind of “limited scope representation.”, You should begin building a defense as soon as possible. Your specific defenses will depend on the circumstances of the case. However, there are some common defenses you could raise:  No abuse took place. Sometimes residents get bruises or cuts through no fault of the nursing home. If someone is scratching themselves deeply, then they could cut themselves.  A pre-existing condition caused the injury. Some people will bruise easily or break bones due to a pre-existing medical condition, not mistreatment. For example, a resident may break bones because of osteoporosis. You can argue that whatever injury the resident has suffered was caused by an underlying medical condition.  Someone else abused the resident. You can always defend yourself from an abuse allegation by shifting the blame to a co-worker.  The resident won’t eat. You might be accused of withholding food from a resident, especially if he or she has low body weight. However, you can counter that the resident refuses to eat and you are not authorized to insert a feeding tube.  If you own or manage the nursing home, then you can raise any defense that an employee can. For example, you can claim no abuse took place and therefore you are not liable for the resident’s injury. Owners and managers can also raise other defenses:  You properly supervised employees. If you are the owner or manager of a nursing home, then you can defend yourself by showing you were diligent training and supervising your employees. For example, you gave them sufficient training and assigned supervisors to monitor their work.  You used thorough background checks. To help show that you have not negligently supervised the nursing home, you can argue that you thoroughly vetted your new hires, by performing background checks, including a criminal background check.  You will need to support any defense with evidence. In particular, you should have documents or eyewitness testimony that supports your defenses. You should try gathering this material as soon as possible.  If you don’t think abuse has taken place, then make sure to document the injury as soon as it appears. If a resident wakes up with deep scratches on his arm, then he may have scratched himself during the night. The sooner you document the injury, the better.  If you believe the resident has been injured because of a pre-existing medical condition, then gather information on the patient’s health. This information should be in the resident file. Look for any condition which could explain the injury.  If you believe someone else has abused the resident, then get eyewitness testimony. If the resident has told you someone has abused him, document that information quickly.  Where a resident refuses food, water, or medicine, you should inform a supervisor so that he or she can address the issue. Also, by reporting the resident’s refusal, you generate documentation to support your defense that you are not withholding necessary food and medicine.  To support your defense that you have properly trained and supervised employees, gather your employee manuals and training materials. Document the training a new hire undergoes. Also find the results of a criminal background check, as well as any notes taken when speaking to a new hire’s references.  You will respond to the lawsuit by filing an answer. In this document, you must respond to every allegation the plaintiff made in the complaint. Go through each paragraph and note whether you agree or disagree with the allegation. If you have insufficient knowledge to agree or disagree, then note that as well.Your lawyer can draft the answer for you. If you are representing yourself, then you can ask the court clerk if there is a printed answer form to use.  See Answer a Civil Lawsuit for more information on drafting an acceptable answer.  Once you have completed the answer, you should make several copies. Take all of your copies to the court clerk and ask to file the original. The clerk should then stamp all of your copies with the date.  You also need to serve a copy of the answer on the plaintiff’s lawyer, or on the plaintiff if he or she doesn’t have a lawyer., Once you respond to the complaint, the lawsuit enters “discovery.” During this phase, the parties can request information from each other.You need to request documents that will help your case. Request any and all medical records relating to the resident. You can then search these for pre-existing conditions.  During a deposition, the plaintiff’s lawyer can ask you questions face-to-face, which you must answer under oath. To prepare for a deposition, you should review all relevant documents.  Your lawyer might also do a practice deposition with you. During the practice session, your lawyer will pretend to be the plaintiff’s attorney and will ask you a series of likely questions. You can then discuss your answers.  The best way to prepare is to get a good night’s sleep.Depositions can be long and quite grueling—up to eight hours a day, in some situations. Only if you are well-rested will you be able to remain sufficiently alert.  The deposition is typically held in a lawyer’s office. A court reporter should be present to record the questions and answers. To give an effective deposition, remember the following:Be truthful. It is perjury to lie in a deposition. Also, a skilled attorney can trip you up if you lie. Even worse, the lawyer can then introduce the lie later at trial. You will lose all credibility with the jury if you lie.  Don’t answer until you understand the question. Feel free to ask the lawyer to phrase the question differently. Also don’t guess.  Pause before answering. You should think about your answer before giving it.  Consult with your attorney. You have the right to consult with your lawyer at any point in the deposition. Simply say, “I need to talk to my lawyer.”  , As the defendant, you can also ask questions in a deposition of witnesses. You should think carefully about who you want to get information from.  You might want to depose the resident’s family to uncover any pre-existing medical conditions which might be responsible for bruises or fractures. For example, if the resident broke several bones, it could be because of osteoporosis or another condition, not abuse.  In the deposition, your lawyer can ask the family member to explain the medical conditions the resident suffers from. You can then use this information in your defense by pointing to these pre-existing conditions as the true cause of the injury.  You might not be able to ask the resident questions. For example, if he or she suffers from dementia, then a deposition would not be helpful.  You can avoid going to trial by filing and winning a motion for summary judgment. You would file this motion after discovery ends. In the motion, you argue that there are no issues of “material fact” in dispute and that you are entitled to judgment in your favor.A material fact is a fact that would make a difference in the case. What color uniforms your employees wear is not a material fact in a nursing home abuse case. However, whether the resident ever fell out of bed before is a material fact. This fact is material because, if it is true, then it shows the nursing home was on notice to take precautions to keep the resident from falling out of bed.  If you want to file a motion for summary judgment, then you should have your lawyer draft it. It is a complicated motion which requires close familiarity with the law.  You can hire an attorney to represent you during the trial. If the plaintiff has a lawyer, then this would be the best route for you to take.  However, if you can’t afford an attorney, then you will need to represent yourself at trial. If you are nervous, then you can observe a trial. Your courthouse is open to the public, and you can sit in and observe one.  Pay attention to how the participants talk to the judge and each other. Also listen to how they ask questions of the witnesses and how they deliver their opening and closing statements.  You will receive notification containing your trial date in the mail. On the day of trial, make sure that you get to the courthouse early. Give yourself plenty of time to find parking and go through courthouse security.  Try to get to the courtroom with at least fifteen minutes to spare.  Jury selection begins with the judge calling a panel of jurors of to the front of the courtroom. The judge will then ask them questions, including their occupation, hobbies, and whether they have served on a jury before.  If a juror admits to knowing either you or the plaintiff or admits that they cannot be fair, then you should ask the judge to dismiss the juror “for cause.”You also should have a certain number of “peremptory challenges.” You can use this challenge to dismiss a juror without giving the judge a reason.  The trial opens with statements from the plaintiff and defendant. You will go second. The purpose of the opening statement is to give the jury a sneak peek at the evidence. Try to lay out the evidence in the order that it will be presented.  Don’t argue during your opening statement.Instead, simply tell the jury what the evidence will show. For example, you could say, “As the evidence will show, the defendant is one of three CNAs who look after Mrs. Smith on a daily basis. As the evidence will also show, Mrs. Smith’s broken arm was first noticed during the week that the defendant was on vacation.”  , You will probably have to testify at trial. If you have a lawyer, then he or she will ask you questions. However, if you are representing yourself, then you will probably deliver your testimony in a speech to the jury. You should plan on the plaintiff’s attorney cross-examining you.  During cross examination, remember to remain calm. If the attorney is able to rattle you, then you will appear less credible in the jurors’ eyes.  Take a breath before answering the lawyer’s questions, and don’t let the lawyer control the rhythm of the questioning. For example, the plaintiff’s attorney might ask a series of short questions to get you in the habit of answering fast. Then the lawyer can spring a complicated question on you in the hopes of getting you to misspeak or to blurt something out. Always control the questioning by taking your time to respond.  Also try to make eye contact with the jurors. As the defendant, you must gain the jury’s trust. If you avoid eye contact, the jurors might think you are lying.  After all evidence has been submitted, each side gets to make a closing argument to the jury. You need to summarize the evidence and argue to the jury that the evidence supports your defense.  Remind the jurors of specific pieces of evidence that support your case. For example, you should say, “Remember when the plaintiff’s own expert got on the witness stand and stated that Mrs. Smith’s broken arm could have been caused by her osteoporosis? You have evidence right there that the defendant didn’t cause the broken arm—her osteoporosis did.”  , After both you and the plaintiff make your closing arguments, the judge will then give the jury its instructions. In particular, the judge will instruct the jury on the law and what it must find.  In a nursing home abuse case, the jury must find that the “preponderance” of evidence weighs in favor of the plaintiff. Preponderance means that it is “more likely than not” that you were at fault for the resident’s injuries.If the weight of evidence is 50-50, then you should win as the defendant.  If you lose at trial, then you should consider bringing an appeal. In an appeal, you will point out what errors the judge made, or you can argue that the evidence was so one-sided that the jury could not have rationally decided the case in the plaintiff’s favor.  Appeals can be expensive. For example, you should hire a lawyer to write the legal brief. Appeals require extensive knowledge of the law and the rules of appellate procedure. Only a qualified attorney will have both.  You also must pay to have the court reporter make transcripts. The costs of an appeal can add up quickly: transcripts, filing fees, attorneys’ fees.  Accordingly, you and a lawyer should weigh the costs of the appeal against the strength of your case. If you think the judge made an obvious error, then you might want to bring the appeal.  You can start the appeal process by filing a Notice of Appeal after final judgment is entered. You have only a limited amount of time—usually 30 days but sometimes as short as 10.

"Rabbits scare easily, so it is important to go slow when you pick up your rabbit. Try not to make any sudden movements or do anything else that might scare the rabbit.For example, do not yell, jump up and down, or thrust your hand into the rabbit’s cage. Instead, try to speak in a low voice, approach the cage at a slow and steady pace, and then slowly reach into the rabbit’s cage.;  , When you reach into the rabbit’s cage, the best place to grasp the rabbit is by the scruff of its neck. Grabbing the rabbit’s scruff will restrain the rabbit, prevent it from biting or scratching you, and allow you to gently pull the rabbit out of the cage.Do not hold the rabbit by the scruff of his neck alone. Make sure that you are ready to support the rabbit’s bottom with your other hand right away.  Rabbits will kick fast and hard if their back legs are not well-supported. Make sure that you place a hand under your rabbit’s bottom at the same moment that you lift him out of his cage. You should have one hand on the rabbit’s scruff and the other hand should be supporting the rabbit’s bottom., Since rabbits are prey animals, being lifted off of the ground can be a frightening experience. Rabbits associate being lifted off of the ground with being in danger. One way to calm down a rabbit when you pick it up is to place a small towel over his eyes. This will prevent the rabbit from seeing that he is not on the ground.  You can restrain a rabbit just by holding it in your arms. The best way to hold a rabbit is similar to how you would hold a football. The rabbit’s body should be cradled by one of your arms and you should have your other hand on top of the rabbit. The rabbit should be tucked slightly under your elbow so that you cannot see his face.Never hold a rabbit by its ears, scruff, or around its chest. These holding methods can hurt a rabbit and cause unnecessary stress.Rabbits also have powerful legs and they can kick hard enough to injure themselves when their legs are not supported.  Rabbits feel more secure when they are on a flat, solid surface, so try placing your rabbit on a table or on the floor. Keep one hand on the rabbit’s neck scruff and the other hand on the rabbit’s backside to keep him in place.If the rabbit struggles, try applying some more pressure to help him feel secure.  You can also wrap a rabbit up in a towel to prevent him from struggling or hopping around.Start with the rabbit on a surface and then place a towel over the rabbit’s back so that the towel comes up to his neck.  Next, wrap the rabbit in the towel by tucking one edge under the rabbit and then turning the rabbit onto his side to wrap the towel around him. Keep wrapping the towel around the rabbit until he is bundled up to the neck and cannot escape.  Try a zippered canvas bag or restraint box. You can also use a zippered canvas cat bag or restraint box to restrain a rabbit.To use one of these devices, you will just need to put the rabbit into the bag or box and either zip it up or close the lid.  A rabbit will not struggle if it is being held in a tight, secure way. If your rabbit is struggling, then you may want to tighten your grip or place the rabbit on a surface until you can get a better grip.Try pulling the rabbit in closer to your body. Rabbits are comforted by being pressed on from all sides, so you may even try holding the rabbit in between your thighs while you sit in a chair or on the ground.  ","approach the rabbit in a slow, calm manner. grasp the rabbit’s scruff. support the rabbit’s bottom with your other hand. cover the rabbit’s eyes. hold the rabbit like a football. place the rabbit on a table or other surface. use a towel to keep the rabbit still. tighten your grip if the rabbit struggles.

"Smoking meats is a very different process from grilling on a barbecue or cooking on a stove. Smoking involves lower temperatures and longer cooking times. Heat up your smoker to about 200 °F (93 °C). Follow your manufacturer’s instructions to get the smoker ready for use, such as adding water and smoke flavoring.  Some people like to cook bratwurst at a higher temperature, such as 250 °F (121 °C), while others aim for a much lower temperature, starting at 100F for an hour, then raising to 125F and 150F. These lower temperatures will mean it will take you much longer to cook the brats.  Hickory or applewood smoke is a good flavor for smoked bratwurst.  Line up the bratwurst inside the smoker and be sure to give each wurst a little room. Be careful not to puncture or tear the casings on each brat.  Brats will cook more slowly on the bottom rack than on the top rack., Leave the smoker to cook the bratwurst for 2 to 2.5 hours. You don’t need to flip over the bratwurst halfway through. Rather, leave them alone for at least 2 hours. Every time the door to the smoker opens, the smoker loses a little heat and you’ll have to cook a little longer.  Adjust your cooking time if you are smoking at a lower temperature than 200F.  After about 2 hours, use a meat thermometer to check the temperature of the bratwurst. The bratwurst should reach 160 °F (71 °C).  It’s best to use the same bratwurst every time to check the temperature. Every time you puncture it with a thermometer, some juices will escape and will make that bratwurst less than perfect.  Use tongs to take the bratwurst out of the smoker. Set them on a plate. Be sure to use a different plate than the one you may have used to load them in. You want to avoid cross-contamination between raw bratwurst and cooked bratwurst.  ","heat up your smoker. use tongs to place bratwurst inside the smoker. smoke the bratwurst for 2 to 2.5 hours. check the bratwurst’s internal temperature. remove the bratwurst. "
"It may be hiding under something like a bed, so lay down and have a look. If not, carry on to the next room.;  , Check the stairs. Gerbils may be found upstairs, as they can jump very high to climb the stairs, but then are too scared to run downstairs. This means that you can search there for them.  Try to keep the gerbil away from glass and electricity, or you could have problems on your hands.  If a gerbil spots glass, it will be curious and may push it off a ledge by accident.  If a gerbil spots electric wires, stop it immediately. Gerbils can chew through wires with ease, which will kill them right away, and they may even start an electrical fire.  Leave someone in there to keep watch if you can, while you fetch your tools for gerbil catching.  Make sure that it has nowhere to run past you or hide.  It may likely climb onto your hand. Then cup your hands gently around its stomach.  Then, poke two holes in the top of the box with a knife or sharp object and put the box near your gerbil. He will find it fun and may jump in, prompting you to quickly put the lid on.  Then, when you spot them, cup your hands around their stomach and put them in their cage.  , If you use wood or mesh doors, note that gerbils can chew through these kinds of doors. The common barred doors are perfect for gerbils.  If they are bored, then they will try to escape and find some fun things to do.  Check every time you interact with your gerbils.

"If something doesn't sound right then it is up to you to figure out why it doesn't sound right.All music is based upon experimentation and the same theory used over 400 years ago. The reason to study theory is to learn about what musicians of the past discovered by themselves.  It’s important that you attend to each specific sound. You don’t want your music to end up sounding like one big wall of noise. Sometimes light rebalancing is enough to completely change the sound of your song. Understand that each individual element is very important to the overall structure., Don’t only take the prerecorded sounds from the program that you are using. You should always be on the search for new sounds to spice up your music.Use the internet to find websites that offer sounds – there are tons of them out there, and you can even find a few that offer the sounds for free if you look hard enough.  You can also pull from the sounds on other programs. If you stick with the sounds on your program for too long your music will become stagnant and repetitive.  It’s important that you continue to search for new sounds. The more creative your sounds are, the less stale your music will feel. You want something that people can dance too, but you also want to stand out from the crowd., You can take out the drums and bass to leave a string riff or you can have a beat play alone. You can even change styles completely. However, many think the most important thing to pay attention to is the kick drum.If you feel like your music isn’t gelling or just hasn’t come together yet, the kick might be the problem. This is the heart of your song. If your mix isn’t coming together, change the kick drum sound or rhythm.  Get some friends together, have some drinks, and check out the danceability of your new track. Your friends will probably be excited to hear your new music and you'll get to see which parts of the song people seem most into. This is a great way to have some fun and hear a few critiques at the same time.  ","listen to how the music sounds. pay close attention to levels. pull from many different sound sources. search for new sounds. make alterations and consider your kick drum. try it out! "

See the world as it really is and not as you would like for it to be.You seek to understand reality completely and through an objective lens. This requires you to examine, study, and learn.  The Four Noble Truths are the basis of the right understanding. You must believe that those truths describe things as they really are.Nothing is perfect or permanent. Think critically about situations instead of inserting your personal feelings, desires, and concerns.  Commit yourself to developing an attitude that is line with your belief system. Act as if all life is equal and deserves to be treated with compassion and love. This applies to yourself and to others. Reject thoughts that are selfish, violent, and hateful. Love and non-violence should should be the rule.Show regard for all living things (e.g. plants, animals, and people) regardless of their status. For example, you would treat a wealthy person and poor person with the same respect. People from all backgrounds, age groups, races, ethnicity, economic groups should be treated equally.  The third step is the right speech. When practicing the right speech, you do not lie, slander, gossip, or speak harshly. Instead you speak kind and truthful words.You words should affirm and uplift others. Knowing when to be silent and holding back your words is also important.  Having the right speech is something you practice every day.  Your actions flow out of what is in your heart and in your mind. Treat yourself and other people well.Do not destroy life or steal. Live a peaceful life and help other people live peaceful lives as well. Be honest when you deal with other people. For example, you would not deceive or lie to get ahead or get something that you want.Your presence and actions should be positive and improve the lives of other people and society.  Choose a profession that is in agreement with your beliefs. Do not have a job that harms other people, involves killing animals, or cheating. Selling weapons, drugs, or working at a slaughterhouse are not acceptable occupations.Whatever profession you choose, you must carry it out with integrity.  For example, if you work in sales, you would not use deception or lies to get people to purchase your product.  Putting true effort into anything that you do will lead to success. Rid your mind of negative thoughts and focus on positive thinking. Have enthusiasm for whatever you do (e.g. school, career, friendships, hobbies etc.).You have to consistently practice having positive thoughts as this does not always come naturally. This will prepare your mind to practice mindfulness.The four tenets of right effort are:  Prevent evil and unwholesome states (sensual desire, ill will, worry, doubt, restlessness) of from arising  Get rid of evil and unwholesome states that have already arisen by countering them with good thoughts, redirecting your attention to something else, or confronting the thought and investigating the source of the thought.Produce good and wholesome states  Maintain and perfect the good and wholesome states  , Mindfulness allows you to see reality and see things as they really are. The four foundations of mindfulness are contemplation of body, feelings, states of mind, and phenomena. When you are mindful, you live in the moment and are open to the entire experience.You focus on your present situation not on the future or the past. Be attentive to your body, your feelings, your thoughts, your ideas, and everything around you.Living in the present frees you desires from your future and past.  Mindfulness also means being attentive to other people's feelings, emotions, and body.  Right concentration is the ability to focus your mind on a single object and not be distracted by outside influences.Going through the other parts of the path will allow you concentrate. Your mind will be focused and not filled with stress and anxiety. You will have a good relationship with yourself and the world. Right concentration allows you to view something clearly and as it truly is.  Concentration is similar to mindfulness. However, when you concentrate you are not aware of all of the different sensations and feelings. For example, if you are concentrating on an exam, you are only focused on taking the exam. If you were practicing mindfulness during the exam, you would notice how you felt taking the exam, how the other people around you were acting, or how you were sitting during the exam.  Metta means non-romantic love, kindness,and friendliness. It is a feeling that comes from your heart, and it has to be cultivated and practiced. It is usually practiced in five stages. If you are a beginner, try to stay in each stage for five minutes.Stage 1- Feel metta for yourself. Focus on feelings of peace, tranquility, strength, and confidence. You can repeat the phrase 'May I be well and happy.' to yourself.  Stage 2- Think of a friend and all of the things that you like about them. Repeat the phrase, 'May they be well; may they be happy.'  Stage 3- Think of someone that you are neutral about. You do not like them or dislike them. Consider the person's humanity and extend your feelings of metta to that person.  Stage 4- Think of someone that you do not like at all. Instead of thinking about why you do not like them and having hateful thoughts, send your feelings of metta to them.  Stage 5- In this last stage, think of every single person including yourself. Send metta to those people, your city, your neighborhood, your country, and the entire world.  This type of mediation will teach you to concentrate and focus your thoughts. Through this mediation you can learn to practice mindfulness, relax, and rid yourself of anxiety.Find a sitting position that is comfortable for you. Your spine needs to be upright and relaxed. Your shoulders should be relaxed and slightly rolled back and down. Support your hands on a cushion or in your lap.Once you have your posture, begin going through the different stages. Each stage should last for at least 5 minutes.  Stage 1- Count internally (breathe in, breathe out, 1 breathe in, breathe out 2, etc.) after each breath until you reach 10. Start over once you have reached 10. Focus on the sensations of breathing in and out. Your mind will wander. Just bring your thoughts back to your breathing.  Stage 2- Continue to breathe in cycles of 10, but count before you inhale this time (e.g.,1, breathe in, breathe out, 2, breathe in, breathe out, 3, etc.). Focus on the sensations you have when you are inhaling.  Stage 3- Breathe in and out without counting. Try to see your breathing as a continuous process instead of just breathing in and breathing out.  Stage 4- Your focus should now be in the sensations of your breath as it enters and leaves your body. This may be your breath passing over your nostrils or your upper lip., The ultimate goal of Buddhism is to achieve inner peace and then share your experience with other people.Attaining nirvana is not only for your benefit, but for the world as well. It is important for you to be a source of encouragement and support for others. This is as simple as giving someone a hug if he or she is feeling down. If someone is important to you or does something nice for you, let the person know how you feel. Let people know that you are grateful for them and appreciate them. If someone is having a bad day, provide a listening ear.  Your happiness is directly related to the happiness of other people.Showing compassion promotes happiness for all. You can practice compassion in many ways:Turn off your cell phone when you are spending time with friends and family.  Make eye contact when someone is talking to you and listen without interrupting.  Volunteer in your community.  Open doors for other people.  Be empathetic towards people. For example, if someone is upset, acknowledge and try to understand why they are upset. Ask them what you can do to help. Listen and show concern for their feelings.  When you practice mindfulness, you pay attention to how you think and feel in the present moment. Mindfulness is not only for meditation but for your every day life as well. For example, you can be mindful as you eat, shower, or get dressed in the morning.Start by choosing one activity and then focus on the sensations in your body and your breathing as you do it.If you want to mindful while you are eating, concentrate on the taste, texture, and smell of the food as you eat it.  As you wash the dishes, pay attention to the temperature of the water, how your hands feel as you clean the dishes, and how the water feels as you rinse the dishes.  Instead of listening to the music or the television as you get dressed in the morning, get ready in silence. Notice how you feel. Were you tired or well rested when you woke up? How does your body feel as you put on clothes or shower?  , Buddha describes suffering differently than you may usually think of it. Suffering is inevitable and is a part of life. Dukkha is the truth that all is suffering. Suffering is typically used to describe things such as sickness, aging, accidents, and physical and emotional pain. Yet, Buddha considers desires(i.e. especially unfulfilled desires) and cravings as suffering as well.These two things are considered the roots of suffering because humans are rarely ever satisfied or content. Once one desire is met, another desire is created. This is a vicious cycle.  Dukkha means 'that which is difficult to bear.'Suffering is a large spectrum and includes things that are great and small.  Desire and ignorance are the root of suffering.Your unfulfilled desires are the worst type of suffering. For example, if you are sick, you are suffering. While you are sick, you desire to be well. Your unmet desire to be well is a greater form of suffering than just being sick. Any time you desire a thing, opportunity, person, or achievement that you cannot have, you are suffering.The only guarantees in life aging, sickness, and death.Your desires will never be satisfied. Once you achieve or get something that you want, you will begin to desire something else. Your constant cravings keep you from achieving true happiness., Each of the four truths is a stepping stone. If all is suffering and suffering comes from your desires, then the only way to end suffering is by no longer having desires.You must believe that you do not have to suffer and that you have the ability to stop the suffering in your life. To end the suffering in your life, you must change your perception and learn to control your desires.  Controlling your desires and cravings will allow you to live with freedom and contentment.  The end of suffering can be attained by traveling the Noble Eightfold Path.Your path to nirvana involves can be summed up by three ideas. First, you have to to have the right intentions and mindset. Secondly, you have to live out your right intentions in your everyday life. Lastly, you have to understand true reality and have the correct beliefs about all things.The eightfold path can be divided into three categories: wisdom (right view, right intention), ethical conduct (right speech, right action, right livelihood), and mental cultivation (right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration).This path offers guidelines for how to live your everyday life.  ","meditate regularly. have the right view. have right intentions. speak the right words. have the right action. choose a right livelihood. practice the right effort. practice mindfulness. focus your mind. practice loving kindness (metta bhavana). practice mindfulness of breathing. affirm and uplift others. treat people with compassion. be mindful. identify suffering. determine the cause of suffering. end suffering in your life. attain the end of suffering in your life.

"Chew toys are very effective at preventing dental problems in hamsters. Giving your hamster a variety of chew toys will help prevent overgrown incisors. If you keep your hamster in a wire cage, the chew toys will keep your hamster from gnawing on the wires, which could damage its teeth.Wooden chew toys, such as wooden blocks, are available at your local pet store.If you purchase wooden chew toys, make sure the wood is untreated and unpainted.Although tempting, do not choose a tree branch or piece of wood from your backyard, since it may contain harmful pesticides, insects, or splinters.Homemade chew toys are another good option. Empty paper towel or toilet paper tubes make great chew toys., Like chew toys, a hamster wheel will keep your hamster happily occupied and prevent it from chewing the cage wires.Choose a solid hamster wheel. If the hamster wheel has wire slats, your hamster could get its toes or legs stuck in them, causing injury., Hamsters have large cheek pouches in which they store food. Hard, sharp bedding can damage the lining of the cheek pouches and cause abscesses (pockets of infection). Examples of soft bedding are CareFRESH® and Yesterday’s News®, which are available at your local pet store.Do not use pine or cedar shavings. They have rough textures and can splinter into small, sharp pieces that can damage the inside of your hamster’s mouth.  ","give your hamster lots of chew toys. place a hamster wheel in your hamster’s cage. use only soft bedding in your hamster’s cage. "
"Lightly coat a 2-quart (1.89 liters) casserole dish with some butter. Set the dish aside.;  , Fill a large pot with 4 quarts (3.79 liters) of water and bring it to a boil. Add some salt and macaroni, and cook it for about 5 to 7 minutes. The macaroni will continue cooking in the oven.  Place a large strainer or colander in the sink and pour the macaroni into it. Shake the strainer a little to get rid of any excess water.  Melt the butter in the saucepan and stir in the flour, salt, and pepper using a whisk. Cook the roux over medium heat for 1 to 2 minutes, or until the flour turns a light brown and bubbles start to form.The saucepan has to be large enough to hold the milk, cheese, and macaroni. You will be mixing everything in this.  Pour in 1 cup (240 milliliters) of milk and stir it with a whisk to combine. Pour in the remaining milk and continue stirring.Be sure to break up any lumps or clumps of flour.,,, Switch the whisk out for a wooden spoon for this so that the macaroni doesn't get caught in it.  Tilt the saucepan over the casserole dish, and use your wooden spoon to help spread it in an even layer across the bottom. of the dish. If you'd like, you can sprinkle some extra cheese on top for that extra-crispy layer.  If you do not want the top to be crispy, cover the dish with a sheet of tin foil for the first 30 minutes of baking.Once the casserole is baked, put it out of the oven using oven mitts.

"You'll need to measure your bust and the dimensions needed for the armholes of the vest.  To measure your bust, simply wrap a tape measure around the widest part of your chest. Keep the tape measure parallel to the ground as you wrap it around your torso.  Measure the armhole depth by measuring from the top of your shoulder to the bottom of your armpit. Add another 3 inches (7.6 cm) to this measurement to ensure that there will be enough space.  Determine how far apart the armholes will need to be by measuring across your back from arm to arm.;  , Draw a circle onto your fabric with a diameter equal to your bust measurement.  This circle makes up the entire outline of your vest.  Use a loose knit fabric to create a sweater-like vest  If you want to skip the binding steps and turn this into a no-sew project, use fleece. Fleece will also create a warmer, cozier product.  Vertically center the armholes on your circle, spacing them apart according to the width of your back (as measured earlier).  Use a ruler or tape measure to find the exact center point of your pattern. Draw a straight vertical line from top to bottom, then a straight horizontal line from side to side. The point of intersection should be the center of your circle.  Half of your back width should extend to the right of this center mark and the other half should extend to the left.  Each armhole should rest perpendicular to this back width line and fall out at either end of this line. Half of the armhole line should extend above the back width and the other half should fall below.  Use sharp scissors to cut out the circle. Also cut along the lines made for your armholes.  Do not cut along the back width line or any other line aside from those specifically mentioned.  Sandwich the raw edge of the circle in the fold of double-fold bias tape. Pin the end in place, then gradually wrap the rest of the tape around the perimeter of the circle, pinning the tape down as you go. Top stitch the binding in place.  Turn over the raw ends of the bias tape. Fold 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) from either end under, tucking the raw end beneath the inner folds of the tape. Pin and sew normally.  Stitch the binding in place near the open end of the tape, catching tape from both the front and back of the circle.  You can use any stitch you find aesthetically pleasing as long as the stitch catches the binding and holds it in place.  For each armhole, you will need to prepare two strips of double-fold bias tape. Each piece must be 2.5 inches (6.35 cm) longer than your armhole.  For one armhole, pin two strips right-sides together so that the short ends are aligned.  Draw a 1.25-inch (3.18 cm) line on the center of each end with the tape folded open.  Sew 1/16 inch (1.59 cm) around this line through both layer to form one end of the armhole, then cut down the center of the line.  Repeat these steps using the other two pieces for the other armhole.  Turn the bindings right-side out, turn under all raw edges by 1/2 inch (1.25 cm), and press in place with a hot iron.  Sandwich the raw edges of your armhole in the center fold of the prepared binding. Pin, then sew in place.  Sew the binding near the open edge of the tape using an aesthetically pleasing stitch. Make sure that you catch the tape on both the top and bottom layers.  Hold the circle against your back and slip your arms through the prepared armholes. Drape the excess fabric over your shoulders so that it hangs naturally in place.  This step completes the project.  ","take your measurements. draft the pattern. draw the armholes. cut the fabric. bind the raw edge. prepare the armhole binding. bind the armholes. try on the vest. "
"Buy a bottle of conditioning oil to use on your glove. Squirt a dime-sized amount of the oil into a washcloth or applicator sponge and rub it into the palm area, fingers and stitching of the glove. Glove oils serve to soften the leather, and, once they’ve had a chance to set in, can protect it from hard impacts, dirt, scrapes and other elements of hard play.It’s important to treat the stitching and webbing of the glove with oil, as these parts absorb most of the strain from catching and gripping and need to be pliable.  Go easy on the oil. Use just enough to lightly coat the glove, and wipe away any excess oil that’s beading up on the leather. Too much oil can oversaturate the leather, making it heavy and susceptible to cracking., Place a softball firmly in the pocket of the glove, fold the glove around the ball and then secure it with thick rubber bands, twine or a set of unused shoelaces. Stretch or tie the bands in an “X” shape so that the glove is constricted at both the top, near the fingers, and bottom, at the base of the palm. Store the glove overnight, letting it rest around the ball. With time, the glove will relax and begin to take the shape of the ball.Since you’re breaking in a softball glove, make sure you don’t wrap the glove using anything smaller than a regulation size softball.  If you don’t have anyone to play catch with, and don’t feel like slapping a ball into the glove repeatedly on your own, you can use a ball mallet, baseball bat or other similarly shaped object to simulate the impact of the ball. Use the striking surface to beat the glove in the center of the palm and in the space between the thumb and forefinger where the ball will rest. Oil the glove when you’re not using it to safeguard it against continual impact.In professional baseball, this is known as “manhandling,” and can be used to break in new gloves or keep them supple between games.Grip the striking implement firmly as you make impact to get used to squeezing around an object, the way you would when catching a ball. This will also give the stitching a bit of stretch.  Anytime you’re not using the glove for games or practice, place a full-sized softball in the pocket and stash it away. If you make a habit of this, the glove will eventually conform permanently around the ball. This is a basic way to break in a new glove, but doubles as a form of maintenance, as the leather of a glove tends to change shape and texture over time.You can choose whether to wrap the glove and ball with bands when you put it away. Once the glove is mostly broken in, there won’t be much of a need to wrap it anymore. Just keeping a ball in the pocket will be enough to help it hold its shape.  ","apply oil to soften the glove. wrap the glove tightly with a band. strike the glove with a mallet or bat. leave a ball in the glove when you’re not using it. "

"It is never too late to start exercising again. Although it may have been a long time and working out again may feel like a “lost cause,” you can start exercising at any time. It may feel like you are back at zero, but this isn't the case. Your body will remember all the hard work you put in previously, helping you return to familiar habits.;  , Depending on how long it has been since you last exercised, you may need to determine your current fitness level. If it has only been a few weeks since you last worked out, you should be able to jump back into your original workouts with little problem. However, if it has been more than a few weeks, you will want to ease back into your workouts.If you exercise regularly, you begin to lose your muscle and cardio fitness after only a few weeks. However, if you exercise less frequently, you will get out of shape more quickly.  If you are unsure about your fitness level, you can perform a few physical tests, such as walking and doing some push ups, to test where you are at.You can also talk to your doctor about what exercises and strategies are best for you.  Set some clear goals about why you are working out and what you want from it. This will give you something to work towards and keep you motivated. A good goal is one that you can track and that gets you going every day.For example, you might set a goal of running a 5K or losing 10 pounds (4.54 kg) in 6 months.  If it has been a few months, or even a few years, since you last worked out regularly, you are not going to be in nearly as good of shape as you once were. It is important to be aware of this and not expect yourself to get back into shape overnight. Because of this, you need to set realistic goals that you will be able to meet. Unrealistic goals will only demoralize you and may lead to injury.For example, if you were previously able to run five miles (8.05 km) three times a week, you should not expect to meet that distance right away. Instead, set a manageable goal of only running a mile or two a few times a week and work up from there.  Before you restart your workout routine, you might need to invest in some new gear. If you have gained a little weight since you stopped working out, you should get some new exercise clothes that stretch and breathe, keeping your body cool and irritation-free. You may also want to look into getting new shoes and other workout gear, such as water bottles and cell phone holders.Getting new clothes can remove a mental hurdle to exercising and push you to get back on track.  Making a vague plan to start working out at some point in the future is not going to give you much impetus to start exercising again. Instead, you need to set a specific date and stick to it. This will help motivate you and give you a deadline to work towards.For example, if you start working out for a New Year’s resolution, you should set January 1 as the date that you plan to begin exercising again.  ","recommit yourself to exercising. evaluate your fitness level. define your goals. set realistic goals. get the gear. set a start date. "

"A multimeter is a handheld device for measuring electrical current, resistance, or voltage. Multimeters are available in either digital or analog models, and can sport a variety of different features. The important consideration when choosing a meter to measure DC offset is the lowest available voltage range.  Because DC offset readings will be quite small (usually under 100 mV), you need a meter with a small range (sensitivity) so that the readings will register correctly. A meter with a 200 or 400 mV range is ideal, but a range of 2 V will also work.;  , To achieve an accurate DC offset reading, you need to follow a few set-up steps.  Begin by disconnecting the speakers. As an alternative, you can take the readings from the 'B' or 'remote' terminals and set the speaker control switch accordingly.  Set the amplifier's input selector switch to an unused position such as 'Aux.' Do not set it to 'Phono.'  Set the volume dial to minimum, the tone dials in the middle position, and the balance dial in the center.  Turn on the amplifier and let it sit for at least 10 minutes before taking a reading.  The meter should be set to measure DC voltage (not current). Set the range of the meter to its smallest setting (200 mV is ideal); if you have an auto-ranging meter you won't need to perform this step. Make sure the test leads are plugged into the jacks used for measuring voltage.  To measure the amp's DC offset, begin by touching the black test lead to the negative speaker terminal. Next, touch the red test lead to the positive speaker terminal. Hold both leads in place while looking at the reading on the multimeter's face. After taking the reading, reconnect the speakers and set the controls back in their desired positions.  The ideal amount of DC offset is 0, which results from a perfectly balanced AC sine wave. In reality, an offset between 0 and 20 mV is very good. An offset between 20 and 50 mV is slightly higher than the ideal range, but the distortion caused will barely be audible. A range from 50 to 100 mV will begin to cause noticeable degradation of the audio quality, while an offset over 100 mV may cause permanent damage to your speakers.  ","purchase a multimeter. prepare the amplifier to be measured. set the multimeter to the appropriate mode. touch the multimeter's test leads to the amplifier's speaker terminals. analyze the result of your reading.

"There is a wide variety of possible functions, but many of these are limited to expensive special-use knives. If you're using a simple, standard Swiss Army knife, then you'll probably only be working with 4-10 basic tools. Most Swiss Army knives include some combination of the following:  Large blade and small blade  Corkscrew  Can opener with 3 mm flat-head screwdriver  Bottle opener with 6 mm screwdriver, plus wire stripper and bender  Reamer and hole punchKey ring  Tweezers  Toothpick;  , This is the basic component of the Swiss Army knife. This blade is usually about as long and thick as the knife handle. Use it for almost anything that requires a knife. Be sure to exercise knife safety: always cut the knife away from your body, and be very careful not to let the blade snap shut with your fingers in the way.  Cut your food, or gut a fish, or slice paper. Carve your initials into a tree or whittle a piece of wood into another shape. Cut anything that needs to be cut.  Your knife may or may not include a small blade. It usually holds the same shape as the large blade, only slightly smaller. Use it in situations that call for a more delicate touch.  Some Swiss Army knives include a metal corkscrew for opening wine bottles.Fold the corkscrew out so that it extends straight out from the knife – as though the knife body is the handle. Use the knife-handle to twist the corkscrew into the cork, and pull firmly on the handle to remove the cork from the bottle.Be sure to remove the mini screwdriver first, if your knife includes this feature. Not all Swiss Army knives come with a mini screwdriver.  This is not your modern twist-cut can opener: it is an old-school manual can opener. Put the lip of the can into the cap of the can opener, then press the sharp bit into the lid of the can until it punctures through. The tip of the can opener also functions as a 3 mm flat-head screwdriver!You can also use the tip of the can opener on Phillips-head screws, if you angle it to use the point instead of the flat breadth.  Use this to open bottles of your drink of choice. The flat tip of the bottle opener also functions as a 6 mm flat-head screwdriver. Use it when you need something larger than the 3 mm can opener screwdriver.  Look for the wire stripper and bender. It is a small notch on the bottom of the bottle opener tool., This tool is also known as an awl. Use it for punching holes in materials like leather or canvas, and for drilling (or reaming) holes into sturdier materials like wood.The tool is intentionally tapered so that you can enlarge a hole by digging deeper and scraping the sides with the sharp edge.  Find this hanging from the outside of your knife. You can use this to clip the knife to your key-chain, your belt loop, or another handy location. You can also attach other useful tools or survival necessities to the Swiss Army knife to keep them in the same place.  The end of the tweezers usually looks like a small knob of grey plastic, while the end of the toothpick is a small knob of tan plastic. Make sure to wash the tweezers and toothpick after each use!  ","learn how to use the main features. use the large blade. unfold the small blade. use the corkscrew. open cans with the can opener. identify the bottle opener. find the reamer. use the key ring. pull the tweezers and toothpick from the end of the knife handle.

"The former is found in the kitchen corner, usually sitting at a 45 degree angle between two walls. Straight cabinets are more typical and found throughout the kitchen.;  , If your cabinet is a perfect square, stretch a tape measure from one wall to the opposite wall for this diameter. If your cabinet is rectangular, use the width for this measurement. You’ll want to ensure the Lazy Susan has about 2 inches of clearance all the way around, so that it can spin more effectively.As such, choose a Lazy Susan with a diameter about 2 inches shorter than your cabinet on each side.  For a full-round Lazy Susan, this is the only measurement you’ll need. As long as its diameter is a few inches shorter than the width of your cabinet, it will fit comfortably in your cabinet.  Since a D-Shaped Lazy Susan has a flat side, its depth will be slightly shorter than the diameter.Check the hardware specifications for the Lazy Susan you plan to order; this will let you know what kind of depth you need for the cabinet. Starting a few inches in from the cabinet opening, use a tape measure to get the cabinet’s depth. This will give you an idea of where the Lazy Susan will sit in the cabinet.

"There’s often little you can do or say that’s actually useful or helpful. In many cases, the important part is just being there. Your physical presence and time is often most appreciated in difficult times.Stay with the person and let them know you’re there for them and supporting them.;  , If the person starts crying in public, offer to go somewhere more private. This can help with any embarrassment they feel. Go to a bathroom, car, or empty room. Being somewhere private can help them feel safe and able to work through whatever emotions they feel.  If they seem uncomfortable, ask, “Would you like to go somewhere more private?”  , If you have a tissue or know where to get one, offer to grab one for them. Crying leads to wet faces and wet noses, and offering a tissue is a sign that you want to help. If there are no tissues nearby, offer to get one for them.  You can say, “Would you like me to get you a tissue?”  , It’s never helpful to tell someone to stop crying or that whatever they are crying about isn’t worth their tears. If someone is crying, let them cry. They are sharing a vulnerable moment with you, so allow them to express what needs to be expressed without telling them how to feel.  You might feel awkward or uncomfortable around someone who’s crying. Remember that your role is to offer support in a way that’s helpful to them, and the focus is ultimately not on you.  They might want you to stay and listen or they may want some space and alone time. Don’t assume you know what they want because you don’t. Asking what they want and need puts the other person in control and gives you the opportunity to listen and respond. Whatever they ask for or need, respect what they say.Ask, “What can I do to help?” or “How can I support you?”  , You shouldn’t feel like you’re in a rush or need to go do something. Part of being supportive is being there and giving your time for the person. If you’re there to comfort them, give them the time that they need. Your presence alone can be comforting, so sticking around and making sure they are capable of getting on with their day or getting further help can be what they need most.  Don’t stop for a few moments then get on with your day. Stay with them and let them know you will stay if they need you.  If you know your friend likes hugs, give them a hug. However, if they tend to be more physically reserved, you may wish to pat them on the back or perhaps not touch them at all. If you’re helping a stranger, it’s best to ask if they want physical touch. If you’re in doubt, ask if they’d like a hug or for you to hold them., The person may be in shock or not want to talk. If they don’t seem willing or wanting to open up, don’t force it. If you’re stumbling to come up with something to say, don’t feel like you have to say anything profound. Just being there and saying (or implying), “I’m here to support you” is often enough.  You might comfort someone who never tells you what’s upsetting them. That’s okay.  Turn up your listening skills and be willing to give your full attention to them. If you ask them what’s wrong and they don’t respond, don’t keep asking. Accept whatever they say and focus on supportively listening.Give them your full attention and pay attention to what they say and how they say it.  Improve your listening by making eye contact and responding nonjudgmentally.  You might think that saying, “I just went through something like that” will be helpful and foster a connection, but really, it puts the focus on you and not them. Keep the conversation about them. If they’re talking about what’s making them cry, let them talk and don’t interrupt them.You might really want to relate to them or talk about something in your life, but resist the urge to do so unless they ask. Your role is to help and comfort them.  If the person is crying and upset about a situation, don’t try to immediately solve the problem for them. It’s more important for you to do less talking and more listening. The person may not even mention what’s wrong, and that’s okay. It’s not your role to solve their problems.Their crying is not a way to solve their problem, it’s a way to express their emotions. Let them do so without interfering.  If this person is having problems coping with their emotions and their tears, it may be time to see a therapist. Their problems may overwhelm you or you might think that what they’re going through might be best handled by a therapist. Be gentle in your recommendation, but let them know it might be a good idea.For example, try saying, “It sounds like what you’re going through is really difficult. Have you thought about talking to a therapist?”  ","be there for them. make sure they feel safe. offer a tissue. let them cry. ask what they need. give them time. give some affection if wanted. don’t feel pressured to talk. listen closely. keep your focus on them. don’t jump to creating solutions. encourage them to see a therapist if they need more support. "
"The first step to increasing your situational awareness is to assess your surroundings in full. Look around you and take account of the type of situation you are in. Different environments will require different levels of focus to maintain high situational awareness.A city environment presents very different dangers and distractions than a rural one.  By identifying the type of environment you are in, you can better prepare yourself to keep a look out for possible risks.;  , The environmental baseline is what you’ve experienced in similar environments and situations. Determine what should be considered normal sounds, behaviors and sights in your current situation so you have a frame of reference to compare unusual behavior to.The environmental baseline in a wooded area is often fairly quiet and usually interrupted only by the sounds of insects, birds, and the wind passing through the trees. It also may be dimly lit and is often sparsely populated by other people.  The environmental baseline on a busy city street would include the sounds and sights of multiple vehicles and crowds of people talking at a normal volume for the level of ambient noise.  Environmental baselines are based on your experiences. Establishing them requires you to consciously consider environments you are familiar with so as to be able to distinguish situations or behaviors that are abnormal.  Once you have established what you feel the environmental baseline of your surrounding area is, look around to identify and consider any possible sources of dangerous situations.Look for people that are behaving in a manner that is outside the norm, based on your past experiences and by comparison to those around them.  Identify individuals that may be armed with weapons of opportunity, which are things that may not be considered a weapon, but could do serious harm to you or those around you. Common examples could be baseball bats or chains.  Look for weapon imprints on people’s clothing. When one carries a concealed weapon, it often leaves what is commonly referred to as an “imprint” or outline of parts of the weapon in the clothes. Look near the waist band of suspicious individuals to try to determine if they are carrying a concealed weapon.  Look for bags, suitcases or similar things that shouldn’t be left alone in crowded areas but have been. Leaving unattended bags in public places is a common delivery method for explosives.  While it’s not always good to let your imagination run wild about possibly dangerous situations, you can use it to establish scenarios in your mind and plan for ways to address them.If you notice a group of suspicious individuals heading in your direction, think about what you might do if they attempted to attack you or those around you.  Look for ways out of your current environment if you needed to leave quickly.  Imagine someone drawing a weapon or attacking you in your current situation. What can you do now to make it less likely? What will you do if it happens anyway?  , Because most people live fairly safe lives, we tend to believe things are going to work out. People often wait to respond to abnormal behavior because they are unwilling to recognize it as a threat. 'Normalcy Bias' is the act of ignoring prospective threats because it seems unlikely that a dangerous situation might occur..Take indications of danger seriously. Don’t tell yourself that what you are seeing “must be normal.”  Approach each situation as though it could become dangerous. This will help you overcome the normalcy bias.  When you focus on one thing so hard that you are too distracted to identify potential threats around you, that is referred to as “focus lock.” Focus lock is a perfectly normal thing to do, but it can significantly hinder or reduce your situational awareness.A common example of focus lock causing a dangerous situation is looking at your phone instead of the road while driving.  On a hiking trail, you may be so distracted by the sights and sounds ahead of you that you don’t notice a snake near your feet in the brush.  When you catch yourself experiencing focus lock, draw your attention back to your environment and any potential threats around you.  The passage of time is an important part of situational awareness. Keeping track of the time can help you identify trends in people’s behavior that may not otherwise have seemed unusual to you. It also can help you to prevent fatigue by knowing how long it’s been since you last ate or rested.If you notice someone walking laps around an area at regular intervals, they may be waiting for something to happen. There’s nothing inherently dangerous about that, but it’s an element that noticing could help you avoid dangerous situations.  Keep track of how long it has been since you last saw the people you are with. Waiting for your child outside of a public bathroom, for instance, is a situation where you may want to keep track of how long it’s been since you’ve seen them.  In the military, a common phrase used in training is “complacency kills.” Complacency occurs when you become so comfortable in your current situation that you no longer work to actively identify possible threats around you.If you feel your mind wandering or catch yourself experiencing focus lock, bring your attention back to the present moment and the situation at hand.  Remind yourself that dangerous scenarios can occur anywhere, including environments that you feel very comfortable in like your home or a restaurant you go to often.  Fatigue makes it extremely difficult to remain attentive and focused. When you’re hungry, dehydrated or tired you grow distracted. Reduced blood sugar levels caused by prolonged periods of not eating can make you just as groggy as a lack of sleep.Take good care of yourself by getting enough sleep and eating well and often.  Notice the signs of fatigue as they set in: you may find it harder to pay attention to things, notice your temper is shorter, or your vision may blur slightly.  Sometimes you may draw unwanted attention by looking directly at a possible threat. In some extreme cases, a possible threat may become a real one if they interpret your looking at them as engaging them in some way. Because of this, practice looking at things from the sides of your vision.Some individuals may approach you or even become hostile if they notice you looking directly at them.  Using your peripheral vision means any dangerous individuals in your vicinity won’t know exactly what you’re looking at, allowing you a slight tactical advantage.  By establishing a situational baseline, you create an idea in your head of what normal should look, sound, and smell like where you are. Use that baseline to predict events that will occur around you so they don’t take you by surprise.If you see a truck pull into a parking lot near you, you can predict that you may hear the sounds of its doors opening and closing or the beeping of its backup alarm.  If you are driving behind a school bus, you can predict that it may stop to let children off in front of you at some point.  If you notice people behaving in an aggressive manner toward one another, you may predict that they could fight, which may be a sign that you should exit the area.  Sometimes you’ve identified the situational baseline in your mind, assessed any possible threats around you, have a strategy to get away from anything that may happen, but you still can’t shake a sense that something’s wrong. Trust that feeling.You may be unaware of how your body is interpreting stimuli surrounding you, but humans have evolved to sense danger. If you feel uneasy, but don’t have objective reason to, trust that feeling.  In a classic case of “it’s better to be safe than sorry,” trusting your gut about a situation and leaving may prove to have been unnecessary, but it’s better to be wrong about it a hundred times than to have been right once without acting.  Where you stand can be extremely important to your ability to maintain situational awareness. If you are in a crowded environment with too many people to keep track of, for instance, you may want to position yourself with your back to a wall so you can see anyone approaching you as they come.Different situations may require different positioning, but always try to put yourself in a place where you would be able to identify any possible threats as they approach.  Positioning yourself near exits may make it easier for you to quickly escape a situation as it occurs.  In crowded city streets, it will likely be more common for people to come into your personal space that it might be in a grocery store or at a park. Personal space is commonly considered to be a circle around you at arm’s length. If anyone comes into that area (close enough to make contact with you) quickly identify any possible threat they may pose.Look for signs of a weapon either in their hands or on their body if you can see one.  Look at their face to see if they are focused on you or if they are simply passing by.  Notice where their hands are and what they are doing with them. If they are going to attack you, their hands will likely be balled into fists or possibly could be carrying a weapon.  ","assess your surroundings for threats. be aware of what should be normal in your situation. identify and gauge the danger of elements around you. use your imagination to plan for different situations. don't assume abnormal behavior doesn't pose a threat. don’t get distracted. pay attention to time. fight against complacency. don’t let fatigue set in. use your peripheral vision to identify threats. try to predict upcoming events around you. trust your gut feelings. position yourself to easily identify threats. immediately identify dangerous factors of those who enter your personal space.

"An outline is a useful way of focusing your attention on just the most important information. With an outline, you capture only the most important words, thus allowing you to retain what matters the most.  When creating an outline, make sure to put the information in your own words. This will make the information more meaningful and easier to recall. If you are copying someone else’s outline, also use your own words. Otherwise, you are likely to forget the information., It might seem like a waste of time, but rewriting your notes helps you to retain information. Why? The brain processes writing as a top priority, therefore allowing you to retain more information.Like outlining, make sure you take notes using your own words as well. Also, try and make connections to the information in your notes. For example, connect what you’ve read to something in your own life or to something you’ve read before.  Remember how you used the sentence “every good boy deserves fun (or fudge)” to learn the notes EGBDF in music class? This type of mnemonic device and many others are useful in retaining information while studying.  Create acronyms as a way of retaining information. For example, the acronym H.O.M.E.S is used to remember the five Great Lakes (Huron, Ontario, Michigan, Erie, Superior).Use word and picture associations to recall what you study to connect new words and definitions to words and images that you can easily recall.For example, if you wanted to remember the definition of a waxing moon, you might picture yourself waxing your car, which increases the car’s shine. Therefore, a waxing moon is a moon whose illuminated surface increases., You probably recognize that you have a preferred way of learning. For example, you might prefer auditory learning activities such as listening to a lecture, or perhaps you prefer visual activities such as reading notes.However, the more senses you involve in learning, the more information you will retain.  When reviewing a concept, try to incorporate reading, writing, listening, and speaking throughout your study time. For example, if you were reviewing the parts of the body, you would not only read the definition and function of each part, but also draw a diagram and discuss the importance of each part with a study partner., Flashcards are an easy to make and an effective method for recalling and retaining information. They are also easily portable, so you can take them with you to review at anytime you want.  Create term flashcards by placing the term on one side and the definition on the other side. For math flashcards, write the math problem on one side with examples on the other. To study an illustration, on one side draw a picture with an arrow pointing to the area of focus, and the answer on the other side.  ","create an outline. rewrite your notes. use memory games (mnemonic devices). engage your senses. create study flashcards. "

Once the health of HMS Prince reaches 25% and it is flaming, it will start attacking with its rear cannons.

"In the immediate aftermath of receiving bad news, you may find it difficult to breathe. You may feel tightness in your chest, a pit in your stomach, or feel like you can’t catch your breath. Focus on your breathing and breathe deeply.  When people are stressed out, they often hyperventilate. Spend some time focusing on breathing into your belly (rather than your chest), inhaling through your nose, in order to reset your breathing.;  , Hyperventilating and breathing through your mouth (as you may do when you are stressed out) can lead to a dry mouth and thirst. You may be crying a lot, depending on the nature of the bad news, which can dehydrate you. You may also be too distracted to feel your body’s normal cues. Keep this in mind and remember to stay hydrated.You may want to carry a bottle of water around with you to help you to remember to drink.  As the saying goes, “Everything looks better in the morning.” You may be better able to process the news and figure out your next steps following some sleep.  Sleep aids in regulation of emotions.Think of an overtired toddler, throwing a tantrum over a broken cracker. That child will be back to a normal, cheerful kid after naptime. You may find that sleep helps you think more clearly and logically about your bad news.  You can also try taking a power nap to reset yourself.  Getting sleep when you are stressed can be difficult. Learn some bedtime relaxation techniques like turning off electronic devices, listening to calming music or a guided meditation, or taking a bath.  Release all the stress, tension, and anxiety you are carrying from the bad news by exercising. Exercise produces endorphins, which help you feel better, as well as helps you feel more energized and alert.Try taking a walk. Even moderate physical activity can help improve your mood and lower your stress level.Take some time out for yourself to play your favorite sport or go to the gym.  Bad news can be exhausting.Your brain is working overtime as it tries to process your news or problem-solve. You may also be forced to take on extra responsibilities as a result of this bad news.  For example, if you received the news that your father was in a serious car accident, you may not only be emotionally drained, you may also be busy visiting him at the hospital, obtaining the police report, contacting his insurance company, and supporting your mother.  Go easy on yourself and give your permission to let non-essential things slide during this time. For example, let the dirty dishes pile up in the sink, or reschedule a work meeting if you can.  You may be tempted to manage your pain by drinking, using drugs, or binge eating. Keep in mind that these behaviors only temporarily dull your feelings and do nothing to help you work through your bad news. These behaviors only create a cycle of feeling the pain and numbing the pain. They do not help you process the pain.If you feel compelled to drink to excess, use drugs, or binge, talk to a friend to help distract yourself, or consider attending a support group meeting, such as Alcoholics Anonymous.  ","breathe. drink water. get a good night’s sleep. exercise. prepare for fatigue. avoid numbing behaviors. "
"This includes a transducer, computer, ultrasound gel and the object to image.  Gather all of your items at first so that you will not have to run around trying to find things.  Wash your hands if they are dirty.;  , This might be on a PC, laptop or a medical imaging computer. The software is where you will see the image.  Different machines have different techniques. Get to know your machine and where things are placed.  There are many different softwares to run an ultrasound. For research purposes, MATLAB is very common.  Insert the transducer into the transducer port and lock it by turning the knob vertically. This locks the transducer into place. In order to remove the transducer, simply turn the knob horizontally and remove.  Freeze the screen on your program before you do this.  Push a little harder or wiggle it around if the transducer does not go into the port perfectly.  Ultrasound gel is always used between the head of the probe and the object being imaged. The gel makes it easier to see the image.  Apply a gracious, half a centimeter thick layer over the top surface.  There is never too much gel, only too little.  The gel might feel cold to the patient but does not do any harm. Unfreeze the frame on the computer once the transducer is touching the object.  Move the transducer around while looking at the image on the computer.  Locate the place you want to take the image. Zeroing in on your focal point might take some time. Be sure to practice so that you can find what you are looking for faster.  Increase or decrease the brightness or contrast in order to obtain a clearer picture. Play around with the settings on your device. Some settings might be better to use than others; it really depends on what you are imaging.  You know that it is a good image if the focal point is in the middle of the frame and there is a good contrast between light and dark areas.  This is the same button you used to freeze the image before firing the transducer. Congrats! You created an ultrasound image!  , In order to save the image you took, find the save button and save the image onto a certain place on your computer for easy access later.  Patients might want a copy of their ultrasound. To to this, find the print button and send the image to a printer.  Look at the color differences.  Ultrasound is usually black and white.  The white is solid tissues like bones because they reflect more light.  The blacker area is less dense and can be liquids or lumen like a uterus.  Use a delicate wipe such as a tissue.  There are ultrasound tissues that you may buy which will provide minimal scratching on the head of the transducer.  Wipe softly but firmly.  Make sure all the gel is off before getting ready to store it.  This will help to protect anything that may accidentally fall on the head.  The top surface of the transducer is very soft and any scratch or spill might damage the quality of the image.  This includes a place that is safe from knocking the probe down.  The probe should always be cool and dry.  If other people are sharing the probe, make sure they also know safe storage protocols.  ","collect all the components to aquire an ultrasound image. turn the machine on and load the software. connect the transducer to the machine. prepare the probe. lightly press the transducer onto the surface of the tissue. adjust the image. freeze the image. save the image. interpret the image. wipe the gel off of the transducer. put the plastic cover back onto the transducer. store in a safe place.

"Being able to see the other person instead of merely talking to them or emailing them lets you share a better connection. You can even share video visits in different places like a favorite spot you enjoy together to bridge the gap.  Visits include plenty of quality time whether or not you choose to do a lot of activities or just spend time together relaxing. Quality time and creating memories is what is important, not what you actually end up doing.You do not want to put too much pressure on each other to do things that are grand or big events, it’s the quality of the time you have that is most important. Too much pressure to make everything perfect can ruin a visit.  Play online games. Watch a TV show at the same time. Use technology like Skype to be able to share a meal or attend an event while apart. Doing things together doesn’t always have to be in person.If you are not sure about what type of activities you can do together miles apart, look into things like a new video game or hobby on the next visit that can carry over to when you are apart. It can be fun to learn something new or meet on line to play a new virtual reality game you both like.  Making an effort to remember special days whether or not you spend them together in person can go a long way in making the effort to keep relationship special and active.  You may not always be able to spend special days together, but taking the time to celebrate in your own way can make them still very special. This can include sending a gift, or a video chat to include your partner in the holiday.  Keeping a calendar can help to remind you of special days and focus on future visits. If you want to help him remember those dates as well, make him a cute calendar with pictures of the two of you with the dates already filled in.

"In most cases, you will need to check with your landlord to make sure that you have permission to sublease your dwelling. Your landlord will almost always have to approve the subtenant, just as you went through an approval process when you leased the place. Your landlord has the right to refuse to allow a sublease. Always get your landlord’s written permission to sublease.Subletting is intended to be a temporary arrangement. For example, if you live in one city to attend college but go back home to a different city over the summer, you could potentially sublease your college-town dwelling for the summer months.If your arrangement is not temporary -- e.g., you are moving out early and do not plan to return -- that is called an assignment. Assigning a lease is a different procedure that permanently transfers all responsibility from you to the new tenant.Do not sublease your dwelling without obtaining your landlord’s permission. You could be subject to legal actions and/or eviction for violating the terms of your lease.For example, in Texas, if you do not obtain consent before subleasing, your landlord can evict your subtenant. Your landlord can also sue both you and your subtenant., Your landlord will be more likely to consider your subtenant if you can show that s/he is a reliable, responsible person. Even if the subtenant is a friend, ask for a credit report and references from previous landlords, where possible.You can talk with your landlord if you are not certain about what questions to ask.  As the original tenant, you are responsible for abiding by all of the terms of your lease. You are also responsible for any violations that may occur from your subtenant.For example, if you have a clause in your lease that says you will forfeit your security deposit if you smoke in your apartment, your subtenant must also abide by that. If your subtenant smokes in the apartment, you will be liable for the damages.  In most states, you become your subtenant’s landlord even though you are still responsible to your own landlord for the property. For example, if property needs a repair, your tenant must request this repair from you. You will then request the repair from your landlord., If it is legal in your state, you should get a deposit from your subtenant.In the event that damages happen to the property, you will be held liable. A security deposit will help protect you.Many states impose strict regulations on security deposits, such as requiring the landlord to hold the security deposit in a separate account or pay interest on it.Be aware that many states have restrictions on how much a security deposit can be and who can collect one. For example, in Massachusetts, it is illegal for a landlord to collect a security deposit that is more than the amount of one month’s rent. Thus, if your rent is $800 and you have already paid an $800 security deposit, your landlord could not legally collect a security deposit from your subtenant under Massachusetts law.It’s also advisable to provide a move-in statement on the property’s condition before your subtenant moves in. Several states require one, but even if it is not required, a statement will protect you and the subtenant. You should note specifics about the condition of your dwelling, such as scratches on woodwork, spots on carpet, etc. Have both you and the subtenant sign this statement., Before signing your sublease, you and the subtenant should work out who will give the rent money to the landlord each month. You can each send checks for your portion, or the subtenant can pay his/her share of the rent to you.  You should also determine how much of the rent your subtenant will be liable for. In some states, you cannot charge your subtenant more for rent than you pay.In many cases, you can expect to recover between 70-80% of your rent from a sublease, unless you are subleasing it furnished. Furnished sublets tend to command a higher rate.If your subtenant is paying only a portion of your rent, you could prepay the entire portion of the rent that your sublease does not cover. This protects your subtenant in the event that you are unable or unwilling to continue paying your share. However, you could lose the prepaid money if your subtenant violates the lease agreement.  Be aware that when you and your subtenant sign the sublease, you are both required to abide by its terms. If your subtenant is only paying a portion of your rent each month -- which is a very common situation -- you must continue paying the difference so that your landlord receives the rent in full. If you or the subtenant do not pay, you will be in violation of the lease. If you do not pay, your subtenant and your landlord may sue you.  Identify the full names of each party and what their role is in the contract.The original leaseholder of the property is the Tenant and the person subletting the property is the Subtenant.  For example, “This contract is for the sublease of an apartment between the Tenant, Jane Smith, and the Subtenant, Robert Jones made on February 1, 2011.”  , State the full address of the property.For example, “The property is located at 1234 Any Street, Unit #1, City, State, Zip.”  If the sublease is for something other than the full use of the property—only the use of a garage, for example—state this in the description of the property.  If the property is for residential purposes, as in the case of a house or an apartment, state that the subleased premises are to be used for residential purposes only. A commercial lease should state that the property is to be used for commercial use only.  State the date the sublease begins and the date the sublease ends.Determine in advance the time at which the subtenant will take and surrender possession.  For example, “Subtenant will take possession on January 1st, 2011 at 9am and vacate the premises by June 6th, 2011 by 12pm.”  , State the agreed upon rental amount and when the subtenant must pay it. In the sublease of property, the subtenant usually pays monthly. For example, “Subtenant will pay Tenant the sum of $500 monthly, to be received by the Tenant by the 3rd day of each month.”  Include any penalty for late payment in this section as well. For example, “If rent is not received by the 3rd day of the month, a $50 late fee will be added to the amount of rent due.”  Include the payment recipient by name. Include the address to which the subtenant must send the rent as well.  You should also make it clear what your own financial contributions will be. For example, if your rent is $1000 and your subtenant will pay $850, you must pay $150 per month. Alternately, you can include a clause that specifies that you have paid your share in full (e.g., $450 for three months) and the subtenant is responsible for the remaining portion.  If the subtenant must pay a security deposit, state the amount of the deposit and information about the return of the security deposit at the expiration of the lease.The contract should state that if the Tenant withholds the security deposit or any portion of the security deposit, the Tenant will provide the Subtenant with a written statement of the reason. The tenant should provide this statement and any returned portion of the deposit within two weeks of the subtenant vacating.  Describe possible reasons for withholding the security deposit in the contract. Typical reasons include: nonpayment of rent, outstanding late payment fees, and damage (beyond normal wear and tear) to the premises.  Walk through the rental space with the subtenant and fill out a move-in/move-out checklist. Document the condition of the rental space both at the move-in and move-out date. This helps determine what, if any, damages the subtenant caused during the sublease period.  Both parties should sign the contract using their full legal names.Each party should retain a copy of the contract.  Make multiple copies of the signed sublease agreement: one for you, one for your subtenant, and one for your landlord. It is highly recommended that you send the sublease agreement and a letter containing your information (e.g., how to contact you) via certified mail with a return receipt. This will be your proof that your landlord has received the sublease.  ","determine if you are allowed to sublease. collect and provide information on your subtenant’s reliability. remember that you remain responsible for the leased dwelling. consider how you will handle security deposits. determine how rent will be paid. state the name of the parties and the date of the contract. identify the property. provide the term of the sublease. state the rent schedule and amount. include a section on the security deposit. sign and date the contract. deliver the contract to your landlord.

"Topical anesthetics, used in conjunction with steroid cream, can be used before a bowel movement to reduce pain caused by anal fissures.Xylocaine, lidocaine, tetracaine, and pramoxine are topical anesthetics. While some anesthetics are available over the counter, many require a prescription. Ask your doctor for a recommendation and, if needed, a prescription for an anesthetic to treat your anal fissures.Creams are applied gently on the rectal region before a bowel movement, with a clean paper towel or wipe. Some drug stores sell wipes specifically designed for applying such creams.  A small amount of a steroid is often combined with creams and ointments. This helps reduce inflammation and numb some of the pain associated with bowel movements.If using steroids alongside aesthetics, you should not use the medication for more than 2 weeks. Using steroids for a longer period can thin parts of the rectum, resulting in further trauma to the area., Your physician should be able to recommend a stool softener for you. This will help ease the pain and labor involved during bowel movements, giving fissures a chance to heal.  While stool softeners are generally available over the counter, you should ask your physician for a recommendation. If you are breastfeeding especially, you want to find a brand of softener that will not harm your baby.Take stool softeners as directed on the medication's label. Only take the suggested dosage and be aware of any possible side effects. Talk to your physician if you experience any side effects.  Combing stool softeners with home remedies, like drinking extra fluids and eating a high fiber diet, can help with anal fissures.  Some ointments contain a muscle relaxant called nitroglycerin. Nitroglycerin can relax the sphincter muscles and reduce contractions and spams during bowel movements, and also help increase blood flow to the anus. This reduces the trauma around the rectal region, giving anal fissures the chance to heal.Nitroglycerin should be applied using a q-tip. Apply a small amount of ointment to the q-tip and insert the cotton tip into the anus. Do not go farther than this, only inserting the cotton portion.The concentration of nitroglycerin in ointments is relatively low, usually only around 0.2%.Topical use of nitroglycerin for treating anal fissures is considered safe while breastfeeding.  Side effects do occasionally occur when using nitroglycerin. The most common side effect is a headache or lightheadedness.  ","try topical anesthetics and steroids. use stool softeners. ask your doctor about nitroglycerin. "

"The trick to growing quality marijuana is to grow your marijuana inside. Growing your marijuana inside will allow you to completely control the environment. This will eliminate the possibility of overwatering (through rain), lack of sun, pest problems, and other issues that plague outdoor growers. But don’t worry, you don’t need a specifically designed space to grow pot. With a little retrofitting you can essentially grow your pot in any indoor space.;  , Perhaps the most important step in creating an environment to grow quality medical marijuana is to purchase and set up your lights. Quality lights and a good lighting schedule will make sure that your marijuana will grow and produce quality buds. In addition, you’re going to want to light-proof your grow room so light will not leak in during the night-time or dark period. Make sure to:  Purchase either metal halide or high pressure sodium lights. The typical rule is that you should have 7000-7500 lumens per square foot in a grow room. The number of lumens vary based on the light, so consult the box or manufacturer before purchasing.  Install surge protectors and use GFI wall outlets to protect against the potential of electrocution if there is a flood in the grow room.  Consider buying a generator to provide backup power in case of a power outage.  Lightproof your grow room by covering all windows with tinfoil, heavy-duty blackout curtains, and more. Also make sure no light can travel underneath the door leading out of the room., A lighting schedule is extremely important to growing quality medical marijuana. Because you want quality pot, you’ll be completely regulating your plant's light source. You need to be diligent about this schedule, and do not stray from it. Straying from your lighting schedule may undermine the quality of your buds.  Purchase timers so you can put your lights on a schedule.  Your initial lighting schedule will be 18 hours of light and 6 hours of dark.  Do not enter the room during the dark period – this could trigger flowering.  Do not let any light at all enter the room during the dark period., Plants, just like animals, need fresh and clean air to thrive. As a result, you need to make sure that wherever you grow your plants has fresh and clean air. In addition, you need to make sure that the temperature and relative humidity of your grow space stays relatively constant. To do this:  Make sure your grow room has good circulation to move fresh air in and out. You can do this by installing specially designed ducts that will move air in and out without allowing sunlight to creep through. The cheapest way to do this would be to install bent pipes in a window opening, and covering the left-over space with plywood and/or other materials. Use fans to further promote circulation.  Make sure your heating and cooling system is running and is capable of providing cool and hot air to the space. Depending on where you are, air conditioning might be the most important since your lights will generate a lot of heat.  Make sure your temperature stays a constant 70 to 85 degrees Fahrenheit. The specific number in that range depends on the strain of marijuana and your climate. Many growers like to keep the temperature between 72 and 75 degrees when lights are on, and allow the temperature to climb to 79 to 85 during the dark period., Soil, next to lighting, is perhaps the most important element in growing quality medical marijuana. Make sure to secure a really good soil mix. Don’t cheap out here. Soil quality and the nutrients in soil will determine the quality of your product. Consider:  Your soil should drain well so that you don’t have water accumulation that could hurt your roots and plant. Soils should have some sand, sponge rock, or pearlite in it.  Have a mixture of fox farm ocean forest soil and half of any kinds of unfertilized potting soil. This mixture will do the trick and this will help enable the root of the plant to access to the food (nutrient) freely.  Include good fertilizer in the soil. The type of fertilizer you choose can vary depending on your taste and budget., The first step in growing your marijuana will be to plant your seeds. While this is a pretty foolproof process (if you’ve done everything else right), there are a number of things you need to do to make sure your seeds germinate and grow. Make sure to:  Bury your seeds less than an inch from the surface.  Provide water to the seeds after burying. Do not flood the soil. Just make sure it is wet several inches down.  Plant extra seeds to account for seeds that don’t germinate or seedlings that die soon after germinating., Be sure to water your marijuana plants as often as they need to be watered. If you don’t water your plants enough, photosynthesis may slow, your plants will develop slower, and your quality will suffer. If you water them too much, your plants could suffer root rot or other problems that will hurt quality. To water properly, make sure to:  Wait until the top of your soil is dry to about an inch deep.  Water your plants until 10% to 20% of the water drains out of the bottom of your growing container.  Wait until the top of your soil is dry to an inch again before watering.  After some experience, feel free to set up an automatic watering system that works on a timer. This will save an experienced grower a lot of time., The second growth phase after germinating your seeds is the vegetative state. The vegetative state is a period from 2 weeks to 2 months depending on the variety of the plant. During this period your plants will develop and mature.  Most strains need a minimum of 2-3 weeks in the vegetative state. However, you can choose how big you want your plants to be by how long you allow them to stay in a vegetative state.  Make sure to give your plant enough water, depending on size of the plant, pot, and other conditions.  Make sure to give your plant enough fertilizer, if it’s not already present in the soil., Once your plants have been in the vegetative state and are as large as you want them to be, you need to induce flowering. This is the major change in the lifestyle of your plants from when they will be growing to maturity to when they will begin to produce flowers and buds. To induce flowering:  Reduce your light from 18 hours a day to 12 hours a day.  Do not let any light enter the room during the 12 dark hours.  In about two weeks, you’ll begin to see bud and flower development on the plants. This will begin the flowering stage.  Continue your 12 hours of darkness until harvesting., The pH of your plant is extremely important in making sure you are growing quality medical marijuana. This is because marijuana does not really thrive in soil that is too acidic. As a result, you should monitor the pH of your soil often to make sure the acidity is not too high.  Test the pH every 2 to 3 days. If you are going soil-less (hydroponic) make sure to test your pH every day.  Your target pH is between 6.0 and 7.0 if using traditional soil.  Your target pH is between 5.5. and 6.5 if you are going hydroponic another soil-less method.  Use a digital pH pen or pH testing strips., After you’ve tested your pH level and determined that it needs to be adjusted, you can take measurements to properly tune the pH. By adjusting the pH, you’ll help create the best environment to grow quality marijuana. To adjust pH:  Purchase pH UP and pH Down solution.  Test your water’s pH level.  Follow directions on the solution’s container and add enough solution to the water until you get the desired pH.  Use the treated water to water your plants and retest after a few days.  Continue adding solution for as long as needed, or indefinitely if your water is out of the desired pH range., As the flowering stage comes to an end and your flowers/buds are maturing, you’ll need to prepare yourself to flush your plants. Flushing is the process in which you stop adding nutrients and fertilizer to the plants and only provide your plants with an excess of pure water. What this will do is make sure that nutrients are flushed out of the soil and/or other medium you are growing in. This will force your plant to rely on nutrient reserves. This will increase the quality of the final product.  Start the flushing process 2 weeks before harvest.  Do not add any more fertilizer or nutrients for the remainder of the plant’s life.  Add enough water so that there is water at the top of the soil. Let it leech or bleed out of the bottom of the container.  Repeat this step a second time after all of the water bleeds out of the bottom of the container.  If you are growing hydroponic, make sure to swap the old water out for fresh water., Two days before harvest, you’ll want to take a few steps to make sure the harvest process will be done perfectly. This will ensure the production of quality marijuana. Make sure to:  Conduct another flush two days before harvest. Make sure to do this twice.  Stop adding water one day before harvest.  Adjust this process (in future crops) and try to make sure your soil is completely dry before harvest., Once your plants have budded and the buds have flowered, it will be time to harvest. Harvesting is a very committed and prolonged process, so make sure you have the time to do this and the space to do what needs to be done. Begin by:  Cutting the plant from the root.  Cutting larger branches to make it easier, if you need.  Making sure you leave at least two large branches.  Removing all leaves. This should be relatively easy because they would have started to die a week or two before.  Removing all excess twigs, stems, leaves, and anything without buds., After harvesting your plants, you’ll need to begin the curing process. The curing process is extremely important and needs to be done right. If you don’t cure properly, your buds could develop mold, mildew, or just dry out completely. Make sure to:  Hang your large branches and the plant for 1 to 2 weeks. Remove smaller buds as they dry out. Remember, you don’t want them completely dry, but maybe half-dry.  The temperature of the room you cure in should be about 70 degrees Fahrenheit.  The humidity of the room you cure in should be about 50 percent.  After you’ve removed the buds from the branches, make sure to put them in an airtight container. Open the container several times a day to allow fresh air in. Always reseal the container afterwards.  After a few days, your buds will be ready., Before you embark upon growing quality medical marijuana, you need to know the specifics of the laws governing medical marijuana growth and consumption in your city or state. Laws vary from state to state and city to city – know them.  Find out if you can indeed grow marijuana at the location you want to grow it. Some jurisdictions forbid growing marijuana close to a school or other public buildings. Make sure your location is zoned and is okay to grow pot at.  Know how many plants you are permitted to grow as a medical marijuana grower. These numbers vary from state to state and city to city. You can be fined or imprisoned if you grow too much.  Contact your local government, police department, or alcohol and marijuana control authority if you have any questions.  Find out if you need a permit or license to grow marijuana. If you do, get your permit or license before moving forward. Growing without a permit may result in substantial fines or jail time., Before you grow medical marijuana, know how federal law applies to medical marijuana. While medical marijuana growth and consumption might be permitted in your city or state, federal law may contradict it and is a higher authority.  Consumption of marijuana for medical purposes is actually prohibited by federal law.  Growth of medical marijuana is also prohibited by federal law.  While it does not happen often, the Justice Department can prosecute you for cultivating or consuming medical marijuana., After you’ve familiarized yourself with your local and state laws, you need to understand laws and rules about distribution of medical marijuana in your jurisdiction and at the federal level.  You may be prosecuted for distributing your medical marijuana to others, even if they have a prescription.  Many states and cities require that people purchasing medical marijuana must do so with a doctor's prescription and buy it from a licensed distributor.  While the federal government may look the other way most of the time when it comes to medical marijuana for personal use, you are much more likely to be prosecuted if you distribute your medical marijuana to others. The danger of prosecution is especially high if you or someone else brings your marijuana across state borders.

"Preventing hemorrhoids from cropping up in the first place is a good way to avoid having to treat them. Try practicing all of the methods below in order to prevent hemorrhoids from afflicting you.  Drink 8 glasses of water per day.Drinking lots of fluid will help.  Eat a diet rich in fiber, especially fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, in order to ease bowel movements.  Don't be afraid to use stool softeners if necessary.  Hemorrhoids can be caused by excessive straining during bowel movements. Try to let the bowel movement pass without straining or forcing, as this can cause an unnecessary pressure buildup and worsen hemorrhoids.  If you sit for long periods of time, get up and move around. Constant pressure can cause and/or worsen hemorrhoids.  If the area with hemorrhoids itches, apply a bit of witch hazel. When wiping, don't use tissue to itch the area.  Use softer, non-aggravating toilet paper. Avoid toilet paper that is colored and/or perfumed.  Cotton undergarments are very breathable fabrics. They also have the benefit of being softer and less irritating than other non-natural fabrics.

"You can write anything you want, even fanfiction - it's not something that only teenage girls do! Afterwards, post it on social media, such as Tumblr or Wattpad. If writing stories isn't your thing, then write a how-to article and post it on wikiHow!;  , Sleepovers aren't just for teenage girls, either! Invite a couple of friends, get loads of junk food, and watch any type of movie you choose. If you have siblings, it may even be a great chance to come up with ideas as to how to prank your brother or sister.  Give yourself a challenge and see if you can pull it off! Here are some ideas for challenges that could liven up your summer.  Say only 'Yes' for one day.  See if you can jump on a trampoline for an hour.  Go for a day without using technology.  Avoid complaining for one day.  Find some music that you like and download it so you can listen to it. You can also create 'summer playlists' or just a playlist that you can sit back and listen to while lazing around outside.  You can go to somewhere simple, such as a relative's house, or you can go somewhere like a sleep-away camp - or you can visit summer classics, like beaches or amusement parks. Alternatively, if you have a friend who lives far away from you, arrange to spend some time with them. Come up with plans for you two to do together!  If you want to go to a camp, depending on your age, you may not be able to go as a camper. It may be a good idea to ask about going as a camp counselor - you still get to go, but it's also a lot of extra work, so be prepared for what it entails!  , Many people have hidden talents that they don't discover because they don't want to try! However, it can be a fantastic way to pass your summer by discovering or developing a talent for something. Try out some of the ideas below, and as cliché as it is, don't get disappointed if you don't start off amazing - practice is the key!  Draw.  Play a sport, such as basketball or hockey at a local ice rink.  Write or copyedit.  Tutor someone. You can be a tutor for anything, such as math, Spanish, science (or physics!), or writing.  Try and create inventions without the help of a guide. This will test your knowledge of what you're trying to create.  While it's not a good idea to spend your entire summer glued to your computer or phone, it can definitely be a good way to pass the time. Try playing games, whether they're simple Flash games or a 'real' game. You can also browse websites, check on social media, or even just look at random articles on wikiHow!  You can find classic video games online. For example, very old games such as Space Invaders or Pac-Man can be found with a simple Google search.  If you have a 3DS and some money on the Nintendo eShop, you can purchase games from the GameBoy or NES era. For example, you can get Pokémon Red, Blue, or Yellow, or you can purchase the original Legend of Zelda game.  A non-video game example of something to do online is to research your family tree. While it might sound boring, it can actually be very interesting to learn about your past.  There are plenty of ways to earn money during the summer, especially since many people are going away on trips and may need to have someone take care of things at their homes.  Watch over someone's pets.  Mow lawns.  Wash cars.  Have a garage sale or use a site like eBay to sell things.  Babysit if you have the proper certifications.  If you're able to, consider getting a summer job. Many businesses have summer offerings for teens to take. However, make sure you have all prerequisites that you may need; many states require you to get a work permit from your school. Research your state to see whether you need a work permit. Additionally, many jobs will not take students under 16.  You may also be able to do volunteer work, but this doesn't earn you any money. However, it does give you volunteer experience.  While you can't really spend the entire summer vacation sleeping, it's a great idea to get some extra sleep while you have the chance. After all, being in school doesn't really allow for a whole lot of sleep!  , Don't get annoyed by this suggestion - classes aren't just for school! You can learn anything through classes, whether they're at a college or online. Many options are available. Pick a subject that you'd like to learn about and find a class on it.  For example, if you're interested in programming, you can find many classes on it, whether the class is online or in person.  You can also learn a language over the summer, whether you studied it in school or not. Spanish and French are commonly taught in high schools, and sometimes even in middle school, but you could also learn German or Italian, or if you want to really challenge yourself, you could try Mandarin Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, or another language that doesn't use an alphabet that you're used to.  Have you had the same room for two years now? It might be a good idea to give it a little bit of a change! Clean up your room and get rid of anything you don't want in your room anymore, and then consider making the following changes.  Move around your furniture.  Replace the furniture entirely.  Paint the walls a different color.  Put up new posters or pictures.  Reorganize your storage spaces.

If you find out you need to add staff, then you’ll need to find the money to pay this person. You won’t be able to reduce your current employees’ compensation to pay for them.;  , You need to write out a description of a job so that you can find salaries of comparable jobs. For example, what you think a receptionist might do could be what most businesses have personal assistants do. You want to pay a reasonable salary based on job requirements and skills, not title. A proper job description should include the following:job title  day-to-day responsibilities, such as “answers the phones and forwards caller to appropriate personnel”  educational experience (high school or GED, associate’s degree, bachelor’s degree, etc.)  years of required experience  soft skills, such as the ability to accept criticism and work as part of a team  , You should pay a competitive salary so that you don’t lose employees. However, you need to decide whether you will pay above market salaries in order to attract top talent.Before you can make that decision, you should research salaries for comparable jobs. Take out your job description and see how much other businesses pay people for comparable employees. You can research in the following ways:  Use websites to check salaries in your area. You can use PayScale, Indeed.com, Glassdoor, or Salary.com.  Talk to other business owners. You can ask other owners what they pay their staff.  Search job advertisements. The ad should list the starting salary range for each position, which will give you some idea of the prevailing rate. Make sure the employer is of similar size.  Employee overtime is generally compensated at 1.5 times the employee’s regular base rate of pay. Accordingly, you should decide whether you’ll have employees work overtime, and which ones. You’ll need to account for this amount of money.  It’s not true that salaried employees are automatically exempt from the overtime laws. Instead, an employee must earn at least $455 a week in salary to be exempt. They must also do work that is managerial or supervisory in nature, requires high-level business decisions, or requires an advanced degree.Accordingly, you can’t budget your secretary for a salary of $28,000 and expect them to work 50 hours a week without paying overtime.  Base pay is only part of a compensation package. Incentives, such as bonuses, help you retain top performers. They also create incentives for employees to give above-average performance. Incentives can be paid in cash, stock, or benefits.Carefully consider whether you will offer incentives to employees. Incentives don’t work in all industries.  Giving an annual performance bonus might work at a company that is mostly salary-based. However, it probably won’t work at places such as cafes or retail stores where there is high employee turnover.Commissions as a percentage of sales can work at companies where profits per sale range widely. However, they don’t work where sales representatives do not have the same opportunities.  Commissions as a set amount probably won’t work at companies where sales are unstable.  Weekly or monthly bonus contests work better at jobs where staff is mostly paid by the hour. They work less well at salary-based businesses.  Remember you don’t have to adopt an incentives scheme right off. You can wait until your business is up and running.  Compensation also includes fringe benefits. You should research what are standard benefits in your industry. Many businesses offer the following:  health insurance  dental insurance  vision insurance  life insurance  short-term disability insurance  sick leave  annual (vacation) leave  , Discuss health insurance and other benefits with an insurance broker or agent, which you can find in your Yellow Pages. You can also use the SHOP marketplace, which is a government website set up to help small businesses: https://www.healthcare.gov/small-businesses/employers/.  Alternately, you can talk to a Professional Employer Organization (PEO).A PEO allows you to outsource certain management tasks, such as providing benefits. Search for PEOs online.  You should analyze your company’s short-term and long-term goals, which will influence your compensation plan.For example, you might be focused on growing your company aggressively in the short-term. If so, you might want to adopt incentives to drive growth.  By contrast, you might want to retain employees for as long as possible. If so, you can offer above-market pay with a strong retirement benefit. This might entice employees to stay with you for a long time.  This can be fairly easy if you are disallowing overtime. Simply add up the expected compensation for each employee. Don’t forget the cost of benefits.  For example, if you have six employees being paid $25,000 per year, then you have $150,000 in base compensation. If benefits are 20% of base pay, then you have $180,000 in total compensation.  Things can get a little more complicated if you intend to hire employees using compensation as a range. For example, you might expect to pay $30,000-35,000 for someone. Add up the total compensation if you paid everyone the minimum, and calculate total compensation if you paid everyone the maximum.  You can’t overspend on compensation. If you do, then you’ll become insolvent and have to close up shop. Accordingly, you should compare your expected compensation with what you can afford.  You might need to offer low compensation, especially if you are a new business without much cash flow. However, you could include performance-based compensation so that you can reward employees if business takes off.  Meet with an accountant if you don’t know how to free up the money to pay for the employees that you need. You can get a referral to an accountant from another business owner, your local Chamber of Commerce, or your state’s accounting society., Your compensation plan must follow federal, state, and local laws. For example, the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) requires that you pay at least a minimum wage. It also requires 1.5 time in overtime compensation for each hour worked over 40 in a week.State and local laws can supplement federal law. For example, your city might have a much higher minimum wage.  Find a business attorney by contacting your local or state bar association.Ask for a referral and schedule a consultation.  You can list the job descriptions at the start of the document. However, it’s probably better to simply refer people to an Appendix, where you will collect all job descriptions.You can write something like: “Positions/Titles and Job Functions. See Attachment A.”  , Based on your research, set a salary range for each job. Type each job classification and the salary range. For example, the job of receptionist might pay $23,000-27,000 annually or $11.00-13.25 per hour.Generally, new hires will be paid toward the low end of your range. However, you can pay on the higher end depending on someone’s experience or whether you really want them.  Pay grades can start with beginner, and progress through intermediate, junior, and senior levels.People in higher grades will be paid more. Using pay grades allows you to reward excellent employees.  Alternately, you could “steps” within each job classification. You can use steps as a way for salaries to keep pace with inflation. For example, a starting salary might be $25,000. In the second year, you might want to increase by 3% to keep up with inflation.  Steps can be used when people progress simply based on the amount of time they’ve been at the company instead of based on performance.  A compensation plan should also identify the hours you anticipate employees working. For example, you might have your receptionist work 9:00-6:00 with an hour unpaid lunch.If you have a lot of employees, you can group them and set hours for the group.  Explain in detail the benefits your organization will provide to employees. Break out each benefit you provide and offer an individual explanation of each benefit.  For example, if you offer overtime, you can write: “Nonexempt employees will be paid overtime compensation in accordance with the FLSA. They will receive overtime pay for each hour worked in excess of 40 in a workweek at the rate of one and a half times their regular rate of pay.”For sick leave, you can write: “Employees will earn 10 days of sick leave credit each year. At the end of the year, any unused sick leave will be carried over to the next year. However, no employee may carry more than 30 days of sick leave. Any excess sick leave earned will be converted to annual leave, at a rate of two sick days to one day of annual leave.”  For health benefits, you can write, “Company will pay 60% of the health insurance costs for each employee.”  , Your compensation plan should lay out the policy for determining whether to pay a raise and calculating how much. You’ll want to follow this plan so that you don’t give out too much (or too little) in raises.  For example, you should first review your job descriptions and salary ranges to make sure they are still accurate. If they aren’t, you might need to give everyone a raise.  Generally, a pay raise should be a bump of 5% or less. It is rare to give 10% or more, unless you are also promoting someone., To remain competitive, you should participate in compensation surveys or perform your own.Make sure your compensation plan states that you will regularly review survey data to assure that your compensation is in line with the market.  Before advertising, analyze whether you can afford to bring someone onto the company. For example, you might decide you want to hire an in-house auditor or attorney. Look at your budget and do basic online research to see how much you’ll have to pay the person.  Consider other options, such as using a temp agency or hiring an independent contractor.Using a temp agency, for example, can make the costs predictable.  If you’re hiring a new person to work in an established job classification, then the employee should be paid according to the existing classification. Look at your existing job classifications and see if the new employee could fit into one.  You need a job description to advertise. You’ll also need one when you research comparable market salaries. Sit down and write out a draft of the job description.  Circulate the description to appropriate managers and others in your business. Ask them to revise your job description.  As your business grows, other employees will know more about staffing needs. Have meetings as necessary to hammer out what you are looking for in a new employee.  You may also want to create a compensation committee that will create a job description and research comparable salaries.  When you add a new employee, you can’t forget what you are paying your current employees. They may be miffed if you pay someone new a much larger salary than what they are receiving. Accordingly, compare salaries so that they are internally fair.You may need to increase your current employee’s compensation in order to make them comparable to the salary of the new employee.  You’ll need to add the new classification to your compensation plan. If you revised other classifications, then make those revisions as well. You want your plan to be accurate.  Even if you don't add a new classification, you should revise your plan if information becomes outdated.  ","draft a list of employee positions. write job descriptions. research market compensation. budget for employee overtime. consider whether to offer incentives. identify which benefits you’ll provide. determine the costs of benefits. adjust your compensation plan to reflect your goals. add up your expected compensation. compare expected compensation to your budget. consult with a lawyer. list the job descriptions. state each job’s rate of pay. create pay grades for each classification. set hours of work. describe your fringe benefits. describe the process for giving raises. provide for periodic review of your plan. determine if you can afford a new employee. write a job description for the new position. compare expected compensation to other employees. revise your compensation plan.

"One way to make joining a class together easier is to pick someone who has a similar personality and who's hoping to get similar things from a yoga class. That way, you'll have an easier time agreeing on which class is best to take.However, having a similar personality isn't the only way to choose a yoga partner. You can also choose by who has similar exercise goals or pick someone who can get you excited about yoga and vice versa.  Many gyms offer yoga classes, but you'll also find studios that are exclusively for yoga. Some yoga classes are even offered in places like parks or art museums. Check with your local gyms and yoga studios, and watch community boards to find places that offer classes.  Even if you do find a friend with a similar personality, you're probably still going to need to make some compromises on what type of class you join together. Maybe they prefer a class with hip-hop music, and you like a quieter venue. Perhaps you can switch off. Alternatively, if you're not into the philosophical side of yoga and they prefers an instructor who focuses on that, just learn to tune out what you don't need.You may also need to compromise on time and location.  One of the benefits of joining with a friend is you can be each other's accountability partners. That is, if you don't show up to class, your friend will notice. In fact, you can have a deal to check up on each other when either one of you doesn't show., If you're both new to yoga, you may find the practice harder than expected. However, don't be too quick to give it up. You'll likely find that you adapt quickly. Plus, you'll begin to notice changes in your body, such as becoming more flexible.  ","find a friend with a similar personality. look for classes in your area. compromise on a class. hold each other accountable. don't give up too quickly. "
"This will keep the moisture of the soil from leaching out to the terracotta jar.;  , Use pebbles or similar items to do this.  The opening of the tube needs to be above the jar rim. Fill the tube with gravel.  Do this around the inserted tube, keeping it centered.  Use soil specifically labeled as suitable for strawberries. This will contain the right type of soil for the strawberries and helps them to grow well.  Ensure the soil comes out into the jar's outlets where the plants will be sitting once planted.  The gravel will stay in place while the soil compacts around it.  Plant these in the various outlets of the strawberry jar.  This will ensure that they receive adequate water as it trickles through the gravel into the soil but are not overwatered.  , Alternatively, place it on a patio or outdoors in the garden.

"You will have a right section and a left section. It is almost impossible to cut all of your bangs at once, especially if you have an especially thick set of bangs. You should separate your bangs into sections and trim them one section at a time. Be mindful of the length of each section as you are cutting to prevent trimming uneven bangs., Comb out your bangs with a fine-tooth comb, stopping just short of your brow bone or the desired cut length. Hold this section of your bangs with your fingers, right above where you stopped the comb. You can now move the comb away. Hold your scissors and use them to trim the hairs at a 45 degree angle, rather than cutting straight across. Trim less than you think you need, as it is easier to trim a bit more than it is to have to grow your bangs out.  Trimming the hair with the scissors at this angle will prevent the bangs from looking too blunt and unnatural.  As you are trimming, be sure to trim in a straight line, even though your scissors are at a 45 degree angle, so that your bangs aren’t uneven. Slowly and carefully trim the bangs until you finish the section.  Unclip the other side of your bangs and comb them out, stopping just short of the brow bone or desired length. Hold the scissors at a 45 degree angle and begin slowly and carefully trimming the hair until you have finished the sections.  Look for any hairs that you may have missed or any uneven places.

"Even if your partner cheated on you or hurt you in the worst way possible, you are likely guilty, as well. Ask yourself what you may have done to contribute to your ex’s bad treatment. It may be difficult to admit to any wrongdoing on your part, but if you are honest with yourself, you may find that you displayed certain behaviors that could have caused your partner’s bad treatment.  Your part could be something as small and innocent as having to work more, and this may have caused your ex to feel insignificant to you. Or perhaps you became distant and your ex looked to someone else for companionship or love. Even if what you’ve done didn’t warrant the treatment you received, there’s a good chance you weren’t completely innocent, at least in the eyes of your partner.;  , Sometimes, people look for partners they know will love them, even if they don’t necessarily feel the same way. As such, they may not put in all they could, and the other partner leaves as a result. Even if you saw this relationship as one that was to give you what you needed at the time, you can still feel quite devastated when it ends.For instance, maybe you were in a relationship simply because you feared being single. Perhaps your partner sensed this and became distant from you. Can you think of any ways that your unhappiness or dissatisfaction in the relationship (or even with yourself) could have contributed to the breakup?  , Sometimes it’s hard to have the right perspective unless you are outside of the relationship. Ask people close to you for honest opinions about how you treated your ex. They can likely give you insight into your behaviors and what you may have done wrong.Go to a close friend or family member and say, “I’m trying to get a better understanding about my role in our breakup. Can I trust you to give me an honest assessment of my behavior?”  , Examine why you behave the way you do. You may find that certain situations cause you to act in certain ways. These behaviors may have led to the destruction of your relationship.  Perhaps you shut down when you are confronted, or maybe you fly off the handle when you are accused of doing something wrong. Taking a good look at yourself and figuring out why you respond the way you do, can help you to figure out how to combat these habits., When you endure a breakup, it’s easy to continuously play it out over and over in your head. However, doing so is self-destructive and also prevents you from being able to move on. Stop torturing yourself and realize that obsessing isn’t healthy for you and won’t change the past.  Are you sitting around in your pajamas trying to find the one straw that broke the proverbial camel's back? Maybe you're reliving that last conversation with yourself over and over again. Ruminating like this doesn't solve anything--it only makes you feel worse.  People tend to think more during downtimes. One way to stop yourself from obsessing is to keep yourself busy doing positive activities like setting goals or decluttering your house. You’ll probably start out slow, but overtime you’ll likely find that you are able to stop thinking about the relationship less and less., Do you feel like you always pick the wrong person? Or that you always make the same mistakes in relationships? If so, it’s time to make some changes. Take a good look at the patterns you display in partnerships and ask yourself if making different choices would have made you happier. If so, then figure out what those changes are and implement them.For instance, if you tend to get lost in your relationships and detach from friends and family, you should take the time while you are single to mend those distant relationships. The next time you enter a relationship, be sure to keep nurturing those connections that existed before you met this special girl or guy.  Even after doing a deep analysis about your behaviors and relationship patterns, you might not be able to gain perspective about your role in a breakup. Talking to a qualified mental health therapist may help you unearth some buried issues of your own that may have contributed to the relationship’s end.  Plus, working with a professional can help you develop healthier, positive habits to assist you in forming relationships in the future.Talk to your doctor about referring you to a therapist. Since your doctor already has an established relationship with you, they might know of a therapist that aligns with your unique needs. Don't hesitate to try out a few professionals before selecting one you like.  You will likely reach the point in which you are able to admit your faults to others. When this happens, you may want to apologize to your ex for your role in the breakdown of your relationship. You may feel a sense of relief when it happens, especially if you are holding onto any guilt.  Apologizing to your ex, particularly if you have children together, can make your life much easier. You may find that visitation drop offs and pickups are far more pleasant, and you may see that your child’s behavior is positively affected.You might say, 'I wanted to take the time to apologize to you. At first, I felt like I was the victim in all of this, but, after doing some thinking, I can see that you were hurt, too. I'm sorry for my part in it.'  , Learning from your mistakes is key to moving on in your life. Examine what behaviors you don’t like about yourself or what contributed to the falling out of your relationship. Making changes and then implementing them won’t ensure a perfect relationship, but it gives you a fighting chance.Maybe you find that you jump into physical intimacy too soon when starting a relationship, leading to an unhealthy attachment. Next time around, you might choose to truly get to know the person and develop an emotional attachment to them before progressing to a sexual connection.  The only way to get closure from a failed relationship is to accept responsibility and then forgive yourself. Doing this will likely take some time and may require real effort. However, it is worth the work and you’ll find that you are able to move on from a failed relationship and find closure.  Forgiving yourself also means that you won’t enter a new relationship with old baggage. Stop beating yourself up and open your eyes and arms to the future. Give yourself a hug and remember that you can only do the best you can with the information you have available. Now that you know better you can do better., Some people view being single as a curse when, in reality, it's a wonderful time to explore you. Take advantage of your unhitched status to rediscover old passions, learn new skills, set objective goals and build fresh connections with the people around you.Use a weekend to see your city from the eyes of a tourist. Check out a restaurant you've never tried. Visit a museum or art gallery.  Pick up a new skill like boxing or crafting. Learn a new language. Take a cooking or sewing class.  Go back to school to finish your degree. Or, sign up for that interesting certification course to enhance your resume.  Join a group class at your gym to meet some new people. Start saying 'hi' to the people you pass on the sidewalk.  ","assess your part in the breakup of the relationship. ask yourself if you were really happy in the relationship. talk to others about your mistakes. learn why you do what you do. stop obsessing. make different choices. see a therapist. apologize to your ex. ask yourself what you can do differently in the future. forgive yourself. embrace your single life.

"Local animal shelters will likely be able to help in some way. Specifically, they may offer affordable veterinary services, especially for animals in emergency situations. They may also be able to pay your veterinary bill and allow you to repay them in more manageable monthly payments.If your local shelter is unable to offer veterinary care, they will likely help you find other local organizations who may offer inexpensive care or provide financial assistance.  Many veterinary schools have low-cost clinics where vets that are being trained work with experienced vets to learn how to care for animals.

"If you are completing IVF with a partner, it is important to maintain the solid foundation of your relationship. Consider your opinions on everything, from which doctor you work with, to the number of eggs to be transplanted. Talk, but also listen actively. Ask questions and speak up (respectfully) if you disagree with something.  Maintaining open communication will be especially helpful if you must make difficult decisions, such as if you must consider selective fetal reduction (a process in which the number of embryos are reduced to prevent multiple pregnancies). Ask your partner, “How do you feel about reduction at this moment? How do you think you will feel about it five years from now, or 10 years?”  Ask for your partner’s thoughts and feelings. You might say, “What does your heart tell you? What does your head tell you?” Then answer the same questions for them.;  , Spend a maximum of 20 minutes each day discussing IVF with your partner. Anything else that needs to be said can wait until tomorrow. Don’t let IVF take over every aspect of your life.Before you even start the process, decide when you will need to stop if it is not successful. Knowing that the process will have an end point can help you get through the rough times and give it your all.  It is important to emphasize the positive. As part of your 20 minutes, state at least one of your hopes for the future. For example, “I hope we get to buy little baby booties.”  Ask your partner, “How many traditional IVF cycles should we undergo?” or, “How many months do you think we can handle this emotionally?”, While sitting in the waiting room, tell a silly joke or chuckle about something goofy that your partner did in the past. After a round of appointments, go see a funny movie or a stand up comic to celebrate. Laughter reduces pain awareness and enhances quality of life.See if you can find something funny about the process. For example, the time requirements of IVF injections may result in you getting one in an odd location, such as an elevator. Say, “Well that was a memorable elevator ride!”, Sit down with your partner and create a clear budget showing money coming in and going out, prior to the IVF process. Then, see what monies you can realistically allocate. Investigate what, if any, treatments your insurance will cover.  Cutting down on expenses, taking on additional employment, or even liquidating investments are some revenue-generating options.  A single IVF treatment can cost between $12,000 to $17,000. Keep in mind that many people require multiple cycles to be successful., Frequent, face-to-face interactions with the medical team are important. You will likely be interacting with nurses more often than you see the doctor, so take the time to get to know the nurses and establish a positive relationship. Before you even arrive, write down a list of your most critical questions and concerns. Prioritize the questions and make it your goal to get five of the most important ones answered. If you feel unsatisfied at the end of the current appointment, make another one just for discussion.  Keep your queries specific and direct. Instead of asking, “What should I do after implantation?”, you might say, “Should I rest after implantation and, if so, for how long?”  Don’t be afraid to reach out to the medical team via email or the phone. If you did not get your questions answered in person, type them up and send them, flagging the email as “Important.”  Patients are only usually able to speak for 12 seconds before being interrupted by their physician. So, be assertive and re-direct the conversation back to you by stating, “Can we pause for a moment and address the questions that I prepared?”, Give you friends and family a good idea as to your appointment schedule and request volunteers to accompany you. Even if they stay in the waiting room, you will want support for many of your meetings with doctors, ultrasound technicians, etc.  If you are expecting a phone call with news about the results of your implantation, for example, ask a close friend to spend that day with you (if your partner is not available). You will want someone there to celebrate with or to comfort you if things didn't go as planned.  Getting assistance from people close to you also gives you an opportunity to educate them about the process of IVF.

"As soon as you understand that you’ll be returning with a two-handed backhand, get into position by turning your body perpendicular to your opponent. If you’re right-handed, you will have your right foot forward and vice versa for left-handed players.;  , A two-handed grip is essentially a continental grip with your dominant hand combined with a semi-Western forehand grip with your non-dominant hand.For players unfamiliar with the various grips, hold your racket looking at the bottom of the pommel with the racket face vertical. Each flat surface on the octagonal grip is a numbered bevel. Start with one on top and and number each bevel clockwise until you get to eight (which is closer to what would be 11 o’clock on a clock face).For this grip place the base knuckle of your index finger on bevel two with the center palm of the hand on bevel one. With your left hand above your right, place both the base index knuckle a palm over bevel seven.Mirror this grip for left-handed players.  Keep enough bend in your elbows so that the racket face is higher in position than your hands. If you have it racket outstretched too far, then you’re going to steal power away from the swing., You’ll transfer power from your back leg to your front leg as you move through your swing, so ensure that you have planted your leg to start.  This will be reversed for left-handed players.  Many players tend to twist back at their hips, but you have to remember to pull back from the shoulders. To get the most powerful two-handed backhand, you should pull your arms back until you can practically rest your chin on your forward shoulder., As you wind back, you’ll feel your weight transfer to your back leg. Make sure that you don’t plant your back leg because as you follow through with the swing, your weight will transfer forward again.  The slot is the space about one foot below the height where you will connect with the ball.Don’t swing forward yet. Simply lower the racket into the slot while maintaining the correct grip.  Once in the slot, the racket will be pointed very slightly closed face, meaning tilted just barely toward the ground rather than the sky. This is where you want it because as you follow through, your wrist will twist slightly upward to even out the racket., Since the slot is about one foot lower than the contact point of the ball, you’ll lift as you swing.This allows you to uncoil the power in your shoulders and put enough lift on the ball to clear the net.  As you bring the racket around, your weight will transition forward again. As you uncoil, you may even come slightly off your back foot., The ideal spot to make contact with the tennis ball is just after your swing passes your forward hip and as you’ve lifted the racket right around waist height.This is the spot in your two-handed grip where the racket will be perfectly vertical., Keep your eyes on the point where the ball makes contact with the racket as you swing through.Many players can prematurely turn their gaze away from the point of contact. By trying to keep your eyes on that point as you swing through, you’re less likely to err on the point go contact.  The swing should be powerful yet relaxed so that you don’t throw your entire weight into the swing and lunge forward as you contact the ball.This movement should keep your back relatively straight to stop you from throwing yourself forward.By not throwing yourself forward as you swing through, you also keep yourself in a better ready position to attack the next shot.  ","turn your body perpendicular to your opponent. position your hands in a two-handed grip. keep the racket face above your hands. plant your right foot forward. wind back from the shoulders. transfer your weight to your back leg. drop the racket into the slot. lift as you swing forward. transfer your weight forward. contact the ball around waist height just in front of your forward hip. maintain eye contact with the point of connection. swing through without lunging.

"Make a class that suits you.  If you want to camp, then you probably just go with an LMG with Target Finder and stay in the corner all game.  If you run around a lot, then it might be best to use an MP7 with long-barrel or suppressor, fast-mag or quick-draw, and fore-grip or rapid-fire. This gives you range or stealth, rapid attacks, and stability or RAMBO!  If you don't like the MP7 you can go with the PDW with long-barrel or suppressor, fore-grip, and rapid-fire. This is actually a really good class because it has a really big clip with extremely fast firing and still stability. These are the kind of choices you need to make when choosing your class.  It might be a good idea to never put a secondary weapon - because you only have 10 slots and there is never a real need for a secondary weapon when you can just pick up someone else's weapon.  Some good perks are Hardline, Lightweight, or Ghost - Fast Hands - and Extreme Conditioning. This allows you for score streaks, fast movement, stealth, quick fires, and longer sprinting time. Always put at least 1 EMP to assist your team in taking out Sentries/Guardians.;  , This is important because it is what decides your strengths.  If you have a sub-machine gun, you can camp at close range, or you can go out and kick butt. It isn't a good idea for long range unless necessary - for you waste bullets with the wrong class.  If you have an assault rifle, you are really versatile, but you can't move very fast. You can try using the M8A1 with reflex, fast mag, and quick-draw.  If you have an LMG, you should really just camp. It gets you the most kills, and you can't really move much.  If you have a Sniper Rifle, you can quick scope (This is not really recommended unless you are experienced), hard-scope (taking out targets at long range) or you can hard-camp - which is camping and hard-scoping. Most people are hard-campers, and people tend to find this really annoying, so this is not recommended unless you are just in it for the kills. Just remember, as a sniper, watch your back for spawn flips. Check the minimap from time to time, and scope where your team isn't there.  When coming to choosing guns, it's best to know what gun you feel comfortable using. Something light with good aim or something heavy with good sights. Some people choose to have an assault rifle with a light machine gun, while others choose to just have a sniper. The guns depend on your position in the game.  If you like to run around while hammering everyone with a Vector K10 or the HAMR itself, then you have no need to have a sniper unless you're damn right good at quickscoping and noscoping. However, if you're the one who runs straight into camping then a sniper is a good choice for you  If you have an assault shield, it's assumed that you have a backup gun. If you don't, just go Rambo and kill people by bashing, backing up, and then charging at them to repeat the process. Most importantly, don't aim for the head. To get kills, start by shooting randomly in their direction, then slowly aiming for their head so you don't lose accuracy. If you're in close range, don't bother scoping - you'll waste time. Instead, start firing, and then scope while you're doing it. As an overall rule, don't stay in one place at more than a couple of seconds, unless you are camping.  Playing online can help you boost your skills dramatically but sometimes, it's better if you practice with bots instead of players. Bots are more vulnerable than players online so it's easy for you to test your skills and try out different methods.  In Black Ops 2, there are different maps to choose from, and it's good to have a little wonder around on your own game with no bots. Get to know the maps; find a few good sniper spots if you're handy with a sniper.  While you're playing, remember that this is just a game. If you try extremely hard to win, chances are you're just going to end up getting frustrated and give up. If you have fun while kicking butt, then chances are you'll do better. Look for vantage points, and try some 360s! When you feel yourself getting stressed out, remember to just let go (like Elsa) and scream in rage.  ","make a class. choose a good strategy. choose a good gun for you. practice a ton. have fun. "

"Between the property scandals and the complex process of understanding Spanish property requirements, you should consider hiring an attorney that specializes in Spanish land law (urbanismo).  You can choose an attorney from your home country but be sure that they have experience working in Spain.  If your attorney is from the UK, check that they are registered with the Law Society in the UK and specialize in International Transactions.  If your attorney is based in Spain, ask the attorney to provide their registration number and check that they are registered and practising with the local bar association (Colegio de Abogados).;  , Unless you are proficient in reading and speaking Spanish, you should locate a reputable translator that can assist you with phone conversations and the translation of documents into your native language.  Find out for yourself whether the land your are interested in purchasing is located in an area where building is permitted. You can determine the classification for the plot of land that you are interested in by requesting a Town Planning Certificate (Certificado Urbanistico) from the Town Hall (Ayuntamiento) where the property is located. Examine the certificate for the land’s classification which should be listed as one of the following:  Land for development (Suelo Urbano)  Green zones (Zonas verdes) where no building at all can take place.  Certain rural areas (Suelo Rústico) may allow construction and others, called suelo no urbanizable protegido prohibit construction., Rustic land plots are land that has not been urbanized. If a rustic land plot is classified as 'No Urbanizable,' you may be able to build on it if certain requirements are met or you may be completely restricted from building on the land.  Under some circumstances, property with a minimum plot size of 10,000m2 may be built upon. However, the rules vary by region.You may be able to build if the property already had a building.  You may also be able to build on the property if you plan to make your living from agriculture., In order to determine whether you can build on rural land, check with the town’s legal authority, the Town Hall (Ayuntamiento) where the land is registered. Have them set forth the specifications, requirements and limitations on building.Ask whether there are encumbrances attached to the plot. For example, it is possible that a path crosses your land which would render the plot out-of-bounds for development.  Check the Property Registry as to whether the land you want to buy is free of mortgages or other financial debts.  Ask your lawyer to inspect the Town Plan and the partial plan (if you are buying a plot located within an urbanization zone). This should identify any developments planned for the area where your land is located and to ensure that the urbanization is registered and legal.  If you are purchasing a rural property, the Town Hall is under no obligation to provide you a connection to water and electricity. Before moving forward on purchasing a property you should:  Have a meeting with the architects or the construction technical staff from the Building Department (Departamento o Concejalía de Urbanismo) from the Town Hall.  Bring your attorney and a construction specialist to this meeting.  Have your experts examine the Town Plan (Plan General de Ordenación Urbana (PGOU)).  Ask the staff from the Building Department if there is any future construction planned in the area and whether that construction will have any impact on your land.  Determine the expenses of bringing water and electricity to your property and any restrictions you may face in doing so., Spain set up a website to assist non-Spanish purchasers of real estate to assess Spanish property. The website and extract will provide you with the following information:  The status of property ownership and any debts or constraints on the property.  The location and description of the land.  The classification of the land and buildings.  A description of any buildings on the property.  How the property was purchased and by whom.  Whether the purchase was registered as a public deed.  Tax information.  Mortgage information, including the name of the bank that holds the mortgage.  Any foreclosure proceedings.  The information is provided in Spanish and can be translated to English for a fee., Before moving forward with the purchase, check to make sure that:  The seller’s information matches the registered owners of the property.  The property description in the sales contract matches the information from the Land Registry Extract  Make sure that there are no debts or charges, such as a mortgage, on the property.  Make sure that there are no legal proceedings initiated against the property., If you are purchasing rural property as opposed to a house in an urban district, you should take the following steps:  If you are purchasing land from a developer who is also going to build the property, check that they are registered with the Spanish Mercantile Registry and that the property is registered to them. You can check this at: http://www.registradores.org/en/index.jsp.  If you are purchasing property on the coast, check that your builder has an authorization from the Coast department, which provides that the authorities must restrict building within a certain distance from the coast.  If you are purchasing property in urbanized Spain, check the Partial Plan (Plan Parcial). This is the plan of building plots, which must be approved by the urbanism department (town planning department) of the Town Hall where the plots are recorded. This plan shows you whether the urbanization is legal and that there are no other developments planned nearby that could affect your new property.  If you are purchasing second-hand or resale property, make sure the property is free of charges, that there is mortgage or that the payments are up to date and that here are no other restrictions on use, or court orders for seizure.  Obtain a copy of the Cadastral certificate that sets forth the boundaries of your property.  Sign a sales contract before a notary., It is important that you hire an architect that works in Spain. The architect will take your building concept and make sure that it meets all of the requirements of the Town Hall.  The architect will present your building plans to your Town Hall in the Building Department (“Departamento de Urbanismo” or “Concejalía de Urbanismo”).  You must also seek a building permit when you submit your architectural plans and pay a municipal tax.  The Town Hall will study your plans and if it meets with all of the regulations you will be issued a building permit., Once your buildings plans are approved you need to locate a reputable builder who will follow the plans of the architect.  Check if the builder is registered with the Spanish Mercantile Registry located at: https://buyingahouse.registradores.org.  Check that the builder has insurance covering damage to the property.Purchase Spanish Ten Years Insurance (or “Seguro Decenal”). This insurance states that the builder or developer and architect must guarantee that the construction will be secure at least for ten years., The building contract is very important and you should have your attorney draft the contract. This contract should include:  The full name and CIF number of the builder.  A guarantee that the construction was made from the plans and building description (memoria de calidades) provided by the architect.  Specify any extras such as a pool or garage are included in the price.  The start and completion dates as well as penalty clauses for late completion.  Payment terms.  That the certificates from the architect, electricians and the Town Hall will be given to you by your last payment.  An explanation of any taxes.  A guarantee that the builder will organize the final steps of the process regarding documentation. This may include application for and collection of the Certificate of Final Works License (Certificado Final de Obras), the Declaration of New Building, the Horizontal Division (Declaración de Obra Nueva o de División Horizontal), and the Certificate of Habitation Licence (Cédula de Habitabilidad).  A guarantee from the builder that by your last payment the will have connected the water and the electricity., Once the house is built you must contract the architect and complete a number of other registrations to insure the legality of your new property.  Your architect must visit the construction site and inspect that the finished work matches his or her plans and the building license. The architect will then complete a Final Works License (Licencia o Certificado Final de Obra) stating that the work is complete., Once the project is complete, you need to go to a Spanish notary and have him or her prepare the new property deeds. You must bring your Certificate of Habitation Licence (Cédula de Habitabilidad) to complete the transaction. The notary will register your land in the Land Registry so long as you present the following documents:  The building project from your architect.  The building permit.  The final works license.  New Building Declaration., When inspecting your property, make sure that the building meets the specification and that any minor defects (such as faulty light switches or missing door handles) are identified.  Communicate faults to your builder or agent who is then obliged to carry out the repair work.  Once all of the paperwork is complete and you have registered your deeds, be sure that you obtain a certificate of occupancy from the Town Hall (Ayuntamiento). This is an administrative document that permits you to inhabit your new dwelling.

"You will need a total of four rectangles of fabric. Make the cuts from one piece of patterned fabric and one piece of coordinating fabric in a solid color.  Note that you could use two solid colors or the same patterned fabric for all four rectangles if you do not care about creating a contrast.  Use canvas, cotton, or another durable fabric.  Cut two rectangles from your patterned fabric that are 4 inches (10.2 cm) by 9 1/4 inches (23.5 cm). Label these as pieces A1 and A2.  Cut one rectangle from your patterned fabric that is 2 3/4 inches (7 cm) by 9 1/4 inches (23.5 cm). Label this piece as piece C.  Cut your final rectangle from your solid color fabric that is 3 3/4 inches (9.5 cm) by 9 1/4 inches (23.5 cm). Label this as piece B.  Sew around all four sides of pieces B and C separately.  Do not stitch the two pieces together yet.  Use a zigzag stitch, blanket stitch, hem stitch, or other edging stitch. The primary function of your stitches should be to hold the ends in place and prevent them from fraying.  You can hand sew the edges or use a sewing machine.  Fold the top edges of both B and C over. Press the fabric using an iron and stitch it in place.  Fold just a little over 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of the top. As you fold, fold it over to the wrong side of the fabric.  Back-stitch across the top of each piece 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) away from the fold.  Back-stitch across the top of each piece 1/8 inch (3.2 mm) away from the fold.  The smaller piece, C, should be placed on top of the larger piece, B, so that the bottoms and sides line up.  Place the pieces together so that the right sides both face up.  Pin them in place.  Use a ruler or tape measure to measure out the center of the wallet. Draw a vertical line through this center using chalk or washable pencil.  The line should be perpendicular to the bottom edge and roughly 4 3/4 inches (12 cm) away from both sides.  The line should only extend up to the upper edge piece C. Do not extend it over the exposed portion of piece B.  Position pins along this mark to hold the fabric together at the center.  Back-stitch or machine sew along your center mark to stitch B and C together.  Only sew up to the top edge of C. Do not sew onto the exposed portion of B.  This creates the billfold and credit card sections of your wallet.  Place A1 beneath B and A2 on top of the other three pieces. Pin the pieces of fabric together.  Line up the fabric so that the bottom edges of all four pieces meet.  Do not pin the left side of the fabric.  Back-stitch or use a sewing machine to sew along the top, bottom, and right edges of your wallet.  Do not sew the left side closed.  Make sure that all four layers are sewn together.  Leave a 1/8 inch (3.2 mm) seam allowance.  Snip the four corners of the newly sewn piece.  Pull the inside fabric through the opening on the left side of the wallet until all of pieces B and C can be seen again and your perimeter stitches are hidden.  Fold 1/8 inch (3.2 mm) of the open side in all the way around, creating a rounded edge along the left side.  Press this edge with an iron and pin in place.  Back-stitch or machine sew the left side 1/8 inch (3.2 mm) in from the folded edge to finish your wallet.

"Place a pillow between your knees. Lay your top arm across your side and thigh. Bring your bottom arm (the arm on which you are lying) straight out from your shoulder and wrap it around your pillow, with your palm facing you.  You can sleep on either your left or right side.  This will help you keep your lower back curved properly. For additional support, roll a small towel and place it beneath your lower back. Rest your head and neck on a pillow.  Lying on your back and lying on your side when sleeping are equally good positions for avoiding back pain.

"Your Miniature Schnauzer will need a high-quality food meant for small breed dogs to help him thrive. High-quality foods often list meat (not meat by-products) as the first two ingredients on the label, so read the ingredients before you buy.  Miniature Schnauzers do well with a dry food that has about a 10 to 15% fat content, so you should also check the label’s nutritional information to see if the food is within this range.;  , Feeding your miniature Schnauzer two meals per day on a regular schedule will help to encourage good eating habits and it may also help with potty training.You can use the recommended feeding amount listed on your Miniature Schnauzer’s dog food packaging to help you determine how much to feed him at each meal. Take this amount and divide it in half to determine how much food to offer your Miniature Schnauzer at each meal.  Try feeding your Miniature Schnauzer one meal in the morning and one in the evening.  If you have a puppy, then you will need to feed him three or even four times per day. Check with your veterinarian or a breed expert to be sure.  Your miniature Schnauzer must always have access to plenty of clean, fresh water.Make sure that you keep a bowl of water somewhere that is easy for him to access. For example, you might place his water dish in your kitchen or a few feet away from his bed.  Change his water daily and check it often. Make sure that the water is always fresh and clean.  Clean your Miniature Schnauzer’s water dish once per day to keep it hygienic. Try using a stainless steel bowl since they are durable and less likely to harbor bacteria.  All dogs are prone to obesity as well as humans, so it is important to limit your Miniature Schnauzer’s treat foods. Instead of giving your pet table scraps that might make him sick, offer a small portion of something healthy as an occasional treat. Some good examples include:  cooked sweet potato  cooked green beans  cooked peas  fresh blueberries  broccoli  baby carrots  watermelon chunks  banana, Some foods can make your Miniature Schnauzer ill and may even kill your dog if he eats them.

"Humans communicate a lot without saying a word, and body language is a significant part of that communication. Most body language connected to physical and romantic attraction give off two basic signals: “I’m available” and “I’m interested.” Here are some signals that your special someone is really into you:Smiling (especially smiles that involve the muscles near the eyes as well as those around the mouth)  Maintaining eye contact  “Intimate” eye gazing (moving their gaze from your eyes to your lips or other erotic areas)Relaxed, uncrossed legs and arms  Leaning in toward you  Tilting the head while listening or talking;  , How a person holds themselves around you can indicate how comfortable they are with you, as well as how much they want to impress you.  When men want to impress someone or appear more powerful, they take up more space physically. If he’s sitting his with legs spread far apart or standing with his shoulders held back and squared, he probably wants to look impressive to you.  When a man or woman’s legs and feet are turned towards you, it’s a good sign that they’re comfortable and happy with the interaction and don’t want to go anywhere.If their torso is turned towards you but their legs are turned away, they may not be feeling comfortable or happy with how things are going.  When people are comfortable with someone, they are more physically open to that person. For example, your significant other might frequently sit or stand with the front of their body turned towards you if s/he likes you, whereas if you’re at a party and see someone you don’t like, you’ll subconsciously turn away from them., When humans find someone attractive, their bodies automatically display that attraction through a variety of physical responses. Knowing what to look for can help you understand how attractive your significant other thinks you are.  Flushed cheeks suggest sexual excitement. (In fact, this is why some women wear blush.) Flushing may also occur on the neck and chest during arousal. However, some people may also flush when they’re feeling shy or uncomfortable, so this shouldn’t be your only cue.Lips become redder and plumper when someone’s aroused. If your significant other licks their lips when they’re around you, they may be subconsciously (or even consciously) signaling you that they’re interested in a kiss.People tend to touch their face, hair, or body when they’re in the presence of a person they’re attracted to. Twirling hair, flicking the tongue, or someone touching their face or neck with their fingertips are all signs of attraction.  ","understand how to read body language. examine the other person’s body positioning. observe their physical responses to you. "
"You may assume that your parents already know you love them. Even if this is true, it’s nice to hear those three little words. Tell your parents you love them whenever you can. You may be amazed at how happy it will make them., Although telling someone how much you mean to them in person is great, there’s something about putting a pen to paper. Write your parents a letter thanking them for all that they have done for you. Having it on paper allows them to look at it whenever they want to remember your thoughtful words. It may also be easier for you to express yourself in this way, rather than saying it to them face-to-face.You could also write a poem or short story to express your gratitude and love. They will likely appreciate the time and effort you put into creating this gift for them.Another option is to send a nice e-card with a personal message if you are not the creative type.  Touch is the most basic form of communication among humans. As a baby, your parents comforted you when you cried. As a growing child, they may have nursed your bo-bos or caressed you after a nightmare. Unfortunately, touch as a form of affection is often lost as children grow older. Offer your parents a hug to show your love.  The act of hugging releases a bonding hormone that reduces stress and helps fight off physical illness. Hugging your parents more often could actually benefit their health., No matter what their age or their children’s ages, parents usually love homemade gifts. They understand that it takes more time and consideration into making a present than it does to purchase one. Even if the present is less than perfect, they will still appreciate the gesture.  You could paint your parents a picture, make them a card, take a portrait of them and put it in a frame, or even create a sculpture. Or, you can just dedicate an entire day to spend with them one-on-one., If you’re away at college or otherwise living outside of the home, don’t forget to connect with your parents. A simple phone call once or twice a week to check in and let them know how you’re doing shows just how much you care about them.  Your phone calls don’t have to be long. A few minutes of your time is often enough. However, ensure that you are engaged in the conversation. Calling them when you are spending time with others, driving, or are preoccupied in other ways makes it seem that they are secondary. Give them your full attention and they will appreciate that you put them first.Talk with your parents to decide how much telephone contact you all are comfortable with. Some parents may not enjoy talking on the phone as much, while others might like a weekly chat.  Be sure to check what times work for them.  ","tell them often that you love them. write it down. give them a hug. make them a present. call them. "

"If your child is sad, you're probably feeling concerned. Sad children may cry, pout, act disengaged, or generally act abnormal, which can be very alarming to a parent. There are many reasons why your child might be sad, so start by asking your child about what's bothering him.  Don't shy away from talking about troubling situations. If there's a death, divorce, or separation in the family, acknowledge it and answer any questions your child might have.Some children have a hard time putting their feelings into words. Be patient, and keep asking until you get a sense of what's wrong.  If your child doesn't know how to talk about what's wrong, use a game of 20-questions (with 'warmer' or 'colder' responses) to narrow down what's bothering him.If you suspect you know why your child is sad, ask prompting questions to get him to talk about it. For example, you might say something like, 'It sounds like you're sad that Timmy moved away,' or 'I bet it hurt your feelings when Billy wouldn't sit with you.';  , If your child is experiencing something troubling, it's important to make him feel that his emotions are being validated. This starts with how you initiate conversations with your child and carries through to how you respond when he tells you what's wrong.  Let your child talk about whatever is bothering him. Even if it's something that's difficult for you to tell him about, it's important that you listen and respond honestly and affectionately.Never tell a child (or anyone, for that matter) to 'snap out of it,' 'cheer up,' or 'pull yourself together.' Saying these things can send a message to your child that his feelings don't matter.Similarly, never tell your child that his situation 'isn't so bad' - that may be true from your adult perspective, but to your child, feeling abandoned by his friend at lunch could be a crushing loss.  Recognize that many sad children also experience coexisting emotions, like anger or fear. Be patient and try to talk your child down if he's feeling scared or mad at someone.  Some children may not recognize that their parents get sad from time to time. Many parents try to hide their own negative emotions to protect their children - which is healthy to do sometimes, but not to the point that your child thinks you never feel sad.  Showing or talking about your own sadness can help your child realize that he isn't alone, and that it's okay to feel sad sometimes.Tell your child that it's okay to cry, and don't be afraid to cry in front of him sometimes. Shield him or move him away from other kids so that no one calls him a 'crybaby.'  Talk about times when you've been sad, and let your child know that you cry sometimes too.  ","ask him about his problems. don't downplay how he's feeling. talk about your own sad feelings. "
"Melvil Dewey originally created ten general categories that most books could be sorted into. The ten areas are listed below with their corresponding numbers.  000 - Generalities, Computer Science, and Information  100 - Philosophy and Psychology  200 - Religion  300 - Social Sciences (anthropology, archeology, sociology)  400 - Language  500 - Natural Sciences (biology, astronomy, etc.) and Mathematics  600 - Technology (applied sciences)  700 - The Arts  800 - Literature and Rhetoric  900 - Geography and History  , Each of the ten areas contain 99 divisions - more specific categories that fall under the larger areas. Additional decimals indicate the even even smaller sections, which are even more specific. Decimals are added if the topic is even more specific. An example of this specification process is below:  500 Natural Sciences and Mathematics  590 Zoology  595 Arthropods  595.7 Insects  595.78 Lepidoptera  595.789 Butterflies  , The Dewey Decimal System is great when you're browsing. If you wanted a book on Ethics, for example, you would go to 170. Once you were there you could scan the shelves for a book on an area of Ethics that interested you. This is infinitely more convenient than alphabetical arrangement, in which you might find a book on turtles next to one about turbulence in politics.  If your library is large and you would rather not spend a whole day browsing books on the Arts, you could go online for a guide to the various general categories, divisions, and sections. Websites with Dewey Decimal System guides include OCLC, The University of Illinois, IPL.  ","know the ten general areas of content. understand divisions and sections. browse using the system. look online to learn the categories. "
"Your friends might be able to help you shed some light on your annoying behavior. They can tell you what behavior gets on your nerves and possibly give you some ideas to correct the behavior. Talk to a friend or friends who will tell you their opinion kindly and honestly.You could ask, “I realize that you guys get annoyed with me when I get really hyper. Have you noticed anything about my annoying behavior? I really want to stop it and am trying to figure it out.”  Press your friend for specifics. They might be uncomfortable and not want to make you feel bad, and say something like, “Oh, I don’t know, sometimes you just get annoying.” You could say, “What specifically do I do that gets on your nerves?”  Acknowledge to your friend that is an uncomfortable conversation for the both of you. You could say, “I really hate talking about this, and I think you do, too, but I really want to change my behavior, so I’d appreciate your insight.” Keep the conversation light: “I know; I drive myself crazy sometimes!”, Don’t try to be someone you’re not. Resist the urge to change who you are just to fit in. You will be unhappy, and you will not be able to cultivate healthy friendships.If you think you need to change yourself to fit in a group, maybe you should change the group instead.  Make new friends by getting involved in new activities at your school, religious organization, or in your community.  Consider spending some time looking at your behavior and understanding why people find you annoying. Figure out what is the underlying reason for the behavior. This might be something you do with an adult you trust or a counselor, or something you do on your own.  For example, do you talk incessantly because you get nervous? Do you mope and drag everyone down because you want to talk to someone about how you really feel?  You could try writing in a journal to sort out your behavior and emotions. Journaling helps clarify what you feel and learn more about yourself.  ","talk to your friends. know who you are. examine your behavior. "
"You can detect dehydration by using the finger and thumb of one hand to grasp the scruff on your dog’s shoulders. Lift the skin vertically away from the backbone. When you let go the skin of a well hydrated animal springs back into place immediately.  In a dehydrated animal the skin lacks elasticity and may take a few seconds to fall back into place.  A diseased kidney is less able to retain water, which causes water to be lost because it gets excreted out through your dog’s urine. If the loss of water exceeds the intake then your dog will become dehydrated.  To encourage your dog to drink, place large drinking bowls in every room the dog has access to.  Some dogs prefer to drink from flowing water so consider investing in a pet water fountain. Also, the chlorine in tap water makes some dogs sick, so try offering mineral water instead.  However, if your dog is severely dehydrated then your dog may need to be rehydrated with intravenous fluids. Not only does this rehydrate the dog but it also helps to dilute the toxins present in the bloodstream, which can help your dog to feel better. Unfortunately, intravenous fluids necessitate a 2 to 3 day stay at the vet clinic.  Because the kidney cannot filter toxins as it should be able to, urea and phosphate remain in the bloodstream. Both of these substances can irritate the lining of the stomach, and the mucous membranes on your dog’s gums.  These high levels of urea and phosphate may result in ulceration, which can be seen as inflamed, ulcerated tissue on the gums or tongue, or will present as stomach ulcers. The latter is a serious problem because not only are they painful but they may bleed or completely ulcerate, which can lead to much more serious medical emergencies. Urea and phosphate are also associated with nausea, vomiting, and appetite loss.  If your dog is vomiting regularly, or if the vomitus is blood-tinged, talk to your vet so that a treatment plan can be formed. Your vet will most likely prescribe Antepsin. This medication binds to exposed mucosa and forms a protective layer, allowing the area to heal.  The dose is 2.5 to 5 ml (half to one teaspoon) given by mouth two or three times a day., Antepsin is most effective when used with an H2 antagonist (a drug which reduces gastric acid secretion), such as cimetidine. However, the two drugs should not be given at the same time because the Antepsin stops any other drugs from being absorbed). Cimetidine reduces the amount of stomach acid produced, which gives the inflamed stomach lining a chance to settle down.  The dose for a dog is 5 to 10 mg/kg (thus a 30kg dog requires 150 to 300 mg) by mouth or injection, three to four times a day. This is given until the vomiting stops and the dog regains his appetite., Many dogs with kidney disease also suffer from high blood pressure (hypertension). This is because the decreased renal blood flow leads to an increase in distress hormones (renin and angiotensin). These hormones cause sodium retention and blood vessel constriction, which makes it physically harder to pump blood around the body and blood pressure rises as a result.  Untreated hypertension can result in blindness, a stroke, or even sudden death. Hypertension is measured by inflating a cuff around the arm, just as in humans, and a sensor placed on a vein under the tail or on the back of the paw. Three or more readings are taken, and an average value determined.  If your dog’s blood pressure is between 160 and 180 mmHg then giving your dog an ACE inhibitor should be sufficient to protect the dog from the effects of hypertension. However, if the blood pressure is over 180 mmHg then a human anti-hypertensive medication—amlodipine—is prescribed.  The normal dose is 0.1 to 0.5mg/kg once daily. Thus a 30kg dog requires 3 to 15mg a day. The tablets are 5 mg each and, given the wide dose range, therapy is often started at 1 tablet a day (for a 30kg dog). The blood pressure will then be rechecked after 7 days and the dosage will be adjusted up or down accordingly., Concentrated urine is a natural antiseptic and produces a hostile environment for bacteria. However, dogs with kidney disease have diluted urine and so infections are more common. There is also a risk that bacteria will ascend from the bladder up to the kidney and cause infection there. This kidney infection then causes further damage. Many cases are 'subclinical', which means they are lurking and sufficient to be a nuisance but not severe enough to cause obvious symptoms.  It is important that the subclinical infections are detected and treated with antibiotics, before they cause further kidney damage. The easiest way to do this is with routine 3-monthly urine culture, which gives a definitive answer as to whether an infection is present or not, and what antibiotics will work best for killing that infection.  ","check to see if your dog is dehydrated. make sure your dog gets plenty of water. understand what a uremic ulcer is and know how to recognize its symptoms. get a prescription for the vet to treat uremic ulcers. talk to your vet about giving your dog an h2 antagonist with the antepsin. have your dog checked for high blood pressure. get your dog an ace inhibitor. treat any urinary infections that occur.

"Teenage Sims can get jobs too, but keep in mind that they will be stressed after school and will also need to find the time to do their homework.  This will make your Sims become stressed quickly unless they have the 'Workaholic' trait, so once they get the 'Stressed' or 'Overworked' moodlet, have them either talk to their co-workers or slack off for awhile. Slacking off will, however, lower their job performance and can possibly get them fired., Make sure that your Sims are in a good mood before they leave for work, and make sure to work on the skills required for the job as well. (For example, if your Sim has a career in science, have your Sim work on the 'gardening' skill.) Try to get a promotion in 2 work days., Start off in a starter home with 1 or 2 Sims, female or male.

"Acne is in no way pretty. If you have acne, or are prone to breakouts, clearing up your skin can definitely be helpful. Wash your face with a face wash twice a day, once in the morning, and once at night. Use a good moisturizer, preferably with SPF in it. Be careful not to use a harsh face wash, because these can irritate and dry out your face. If you have dark marks, invest in a good dark spot corrector. These can take a while to fade, but be patient, in the end, it will work eventually.  Avoid touching your face with your hands, especially if they are not clean. Touching your face with dirty hands leads to pimples.  If you have bangs, try pinning them back. Bangs can trap dirt on your forehead, leading to huge breakouts.  ;  , If you smell something stinky, it may be you. Try bathing once or twice a day. Use a nice smelling soap and shampoo, but don't use harsh products that will dry your skin out. Brush your teeth three times a day. Clean teeth, and fresh breath are a great help.  If you are old enough, or are allowed to, shave your legs. Hairy legs can be a big turn off. If you are nervous about shaving your legs, get help. Don't attempt to shave your legs if you don't know how to.  When you look at someone, you usually look at their hair. Frizzy, dry hair, isn't very pretty. So take good care of your hair. Moisturize daily if you can. Comb your hair gently, being careful not to rip or tug at it.  Wash your hair with a gentle shampoo. Avoid washing your hair everyday, because this will strip it of it's natural oils, leading to dry, frizzy hair. Always condition after shampooing.  Don't go crazy with the makeup! Keep a cute and fresh look, not cakey or crazy makeup. A little mascara, a kiss of lip-gloss, and a dash of eye shadow, and your set! If you are the daring type, don't be afraid to experiment!

"Some dents are best accessed from behind. This is especially true for dents with very small diameters that are difficult to remove with other methods. Determine if the dent you intend to remove is located somewhere you can access by removing components of the body.You will likely need to remove body components to access a dent from behind.  Determine if you can gain access to the dent based on the tools you have on hand and your level of expertise in removing and replacing body panels.  Once you have identified what components of the body you will need to remove to gain access to the dent, lay down blankets on the ground for any painted pieces you will need to remove. You may also need to replace mud guards from the bottom of the vehicle, tail or headlights or the wheels.Be careful not to lose any of the hardware used to fasten the body components to the vehicle that you remove.  Never lay painted components down on blacktop without a blanket or something to protect the paint.  Once you are able to access the back side of the dent, jack up the car if need be and find the dent from the inside. You may need a flashlight in order to see the inside of the dent.Locate the dent and position yourself so you can reach it.  You may need to try multiple positions in order to apply the leverage you need to the dent.  For larger dents, you may be able to apply pressure to the inside with your hands to pop the dent back out. Dents with smaller diameters may require that you press into them with a harder surface such as the handle to a hammer.Attempt to press the dent back out before resorting to using a mallet.  There is less chance of damaging the metal by applying pressure than there is in striking at it with a mallet.  Wrap a cloth around the head of a wood mallet to soften the striking surface, then hit the inside of the dent with the mallet. You may need to hit the dent repeatedly in order to knock it back out.Be careful not to bang on the interior metal from an angle or the side of the mallet may create small creases in the metal.  Do not continue to hammer on the metal after the dent pops out or you could cause the metal to bow outward slightly.  ","assess the location of the dent. remove body components as necessary. locate the backside of the dent. apply pressure to the back of the dent. use a wooden mallet covered in a cloth to bang on the dent.

"Traveling alone can be pricey because you are unable to share costs with a partner or friend. For example, accommodations are often more expensive for an individual traveller. Despite this drawback, you will be able to spend money engaging in activities that interest you.

"The better the guitar, the better the sound. And that means it will be easier and more fun to learn on. That said, it isn't at all necessary to go out and spend tons of money on a nice axe. Don't spend less than $200. There are a lot of poorly made beginner models out there that could just end up leaving you frustrated.  For Rock, an entry level Epiphone (by Gibson) or Squier (by Fender) model guitar is a good idea to start with. If your budget can handle it, Fender and Gibson have famous names on the headstock. They make instruments the way they made them in the 50s, 60s and 70s.  For metal, some good brands are B.C. Rich, DBZ, Dean, ESP, Jackson, and Ibanez. If you're old school, Gibson and Fender clones can also be used for metal.  Now, you may be asking: what's the difference between a rock guitar and a metal guitar? The most important difference is in the pickups. Heavy metal guitars tend to have 'active pickups', while rock guitars usually have 'passive pickups'. Go ahead and look up the difference.  Remember, just because a guitar has passive pickups doesn't mean you cannot play metal with it. Vice versa, just because a guitar has active pickups doesn't mean you can't play rock with it.;  , Get something small (no more than about 30 watts, no less than 10) to practice with, and spend no more than 100 dollars on it. It should be a 'combo amp'. You don't need to pay much heed to this term, but if you're curious, look it up elsewhere. Anyway, you can move to higher-end models later once you are more experienced. Line 6, Crate, Epiphone, Fender, all make decent entry level amps. Fender, Vox, and Marshall make higher-end tube amps, among other companies as well. Read on to find out what the difference between tube and solid-state amps is.  There are two types of amps: Solid-state and Tube. Solid-state amplifiers are much, MUCH cheaper, and are recommended for a beginner. However, some metalcore and metalcore guitarists prefer solid-state amps because they can sound very harsh (doesn't always apply to cheap entry-level amps).  Tube amps (also known as 'valve' amps, especially in the UK) are frequently used by professional rock musicians, and a large percentage of heavy metal players use tube as well. Unfortunately for the beginner, they much more expensive than solid-state amps. Tube-driven amps are widely considered to sound highly superior to solid-state amps. They are definitely not recommended for a beginner, as they do require maintenance and care must be taken when using them; they are quite fragile and can be costly to repair.  Special note: Some amps use a combination of Tube and Solid-State technology. They are often a good choice for the amateur guitarist who has moved beyond the beginner level. They sound far superior to entry-level Solid-State amps and are a lot cheaper than fully Tube amplifiers.  Another special note: 'tube' does NOT refer to the shape of the amp.  Get lots and lots of these. You're going to be losing them, I promise. No guitarist can avoid that, so have backups. Get some with a thin to medium thickness and some that are heavier. You will probably find you like one more than the other. Once you have found a preference, buy primarily that type of picks. Jim Dunlop makes great picks of all thickness.  Guitars are nothing without good strings. Investing in these will produce awe-inspiring sound.  D'Addario and Ernie Ball strings are the most commonly used strings for both rock AND heavy metal. It's mostly a matter of personal preference.  Keep in mind the string gauge when buying strings. String gauge refers to how thick the strings are. When people refer to string gauges, they usually use the gauge of the high E string (the 1st string). For example, if you buy strings that are .009 gauge, that means that the 1st string gauge is .009 inches (0.0 cm) thick. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar_Strings#Electric_Guitar for an accurate list of string gauges.  The thicker the string gauge, the more bass you can hear and powerful-sounding the strings will be, but it will be more difficult to do string bends. A string bend is when you bend the string so you can change the pitch of the note. The thinner the string gauge, the easier it will be to do string bends, but the strings will sound more like treble. Make sure you try many different kinds so you can figure out what suits you best.  Tablature is a system that uses numbers to represent positions on the fretboard. Remember, the 1st string is the one closest to your feet when you play, and the 6th string is closest to your head.  The long lines represent the strings:  E (1st)---------------------------------------------  B (2nd)---------------------------------------------  G (3rd)---------------------------------------------  D (4th)---------------------------------------------  A (5th)---------------------------------------------  E (6th)---------------------------------------------  , Here is a tablature staff telling you to play a note at the 3rd fret on the 6th string, then a note at the 6th fret on the same string, then a note on the 3rd fret of the 5th string, and finally two notes together - 2nd fret 4th string and the fifth string open (not fretting any note). Whenever notes are shown directly over or under other notes, all of them are played together as a chord.  E (1st)---------------------------------------------  B (2nd)---------------------------------------------  G (3rd)---------------------------------------------  D (4th)-------2-------------------------------------  A (5th)-----3-0-------------------------------------  E (6th)-3-6-----------------------------------------  , If you don't know how to tune the guitar, buy a tuner. Everybody uses them anyway, because tuning by ear is impossible for a beginner. If you cannot get a tuner, use a pitch pipe or some point of reference to:  Tune the fifth string to A.  Then match the sound of the 5th fret on the 6th string to the open A.  Match the D string to the 5th fret of the 5th string.  Match the G string to the 5th fret of the 4th string.  Match the B string to the 4th fret of the 3rd string.  Match the high E string to the 5th fret of the 2nd string.  Key, is a big mystery to a lot of beginners. It's going to remain one too - because we aren't going into the swamp of music theory here. Next is this nifty chart which will tell you what fret (position) you can play your pentatonic scale at over any chord and stay in key. If this confuses you, remember that the scale starts on the 6th string, and the first note in the pattern is the root. Even if you skip the 6th string and start playing on the 4th, whatever fret you started on is your position. If you started anywhere on the 5th fret, you're playing in the key of A, etc. Still confused? Have a look at this:  ","choose a guitar. buy an amp. buy some picks. buy strings. learn to understand tablature, often shortened to 'tab' or 'tabs'. learn from examples. tune your ax. learn about key.

"Before you start skimming through classified ads, check whether it’s free to post listings or if a fee is charged to do so. Expect to find puppy mills, backyard breeders, and scammers advertising dogs on free sites. Remember: their chief concern is making money, so obviously they’re going to spend as little as possible and certainly take advantage of free advertising.This doesn’t mean that sites that charge money to post listings are 100% free of untrustworthy sellers.  Also, just because a few bad apples use free sites doesn’t mean that everyone who posts on them is a bad apple, too.;  , Obviously, if someone has listed a dog for sale, then a dog’s available (assuming, of course, the someone in question isn’t a scammer). If possible, go back through the user’s history. Determine whether they seem to have a continuous supply of dogs available. If so, scratch this user off your list of potential sellers.Responsible breeders allow substantial breaks in between litters so the mother can fully recover before breeding again, meaning puppies are not always available for sale.Therefore, a seller who has dogs to sell at any time either is a strong indicator of a poor breeding environment., If an ad mentions multiple dogs for sale, check if they are all the same breed. If the ad only mentions an individual dog for sale, search through the seller’s other postings, both current and recent. Again, see if each dog listed belongs to the same breed. If not, consider the seller a no-go.Responsible breeders usually specialize in just one breed, never more than two or three.  A wide variety of breeds is a strong sign of cost-cutting and less-than-expert knowledge about any one breed.  Check which payment method the seller insists on, if mentioned. Avoid cash-only, online, and sight-unseen purchases. Also check to see what (if any) steps you need to take before they will complete a sale. Although you may be eager to bring home a new dog as soon as possible, favor sellers who offer or even insist on visits and interviews before they are willing to sell.Trustworthy sellers should allow you to meet the dog, tour their entire breeding facility, meet the dog’s parents, and share its documentation and medical history before purchase.  Responsible sellers and breeders should be concerned about the dog’s future and just as keen to interview you as you are to talk with them.  Sellers and breeders should promise some form of guarantee that you can return the dog for any reason in case either you or it does not adjust to its new home., If the ad provides a link to the seller’s official website, copy-and-paste text from the website to a search engine to make sure they didn’t lift it off a more trustworthy source.If their site appears to be legit, contact other local organizations and/or individuals who may have dealt with or heard of the seller. These may include:  Previous customers listed as references by the seller.Dog training schools  Veterinarians  Groomers  Animal shelters and rescue organizations  ","be on guard with free classifieds. check for availability. see what other dogs they offer. evaluate the buying process. double-check the seller through other sources.

"This makes it easier to ensure that everything has been made or picked, and packed up to prevent last-minute panic. Being part of a farmers market means hard work. You will need to prepare produce leading up to the day, transport it safely and set up very early in the morning before customers arrive. You may also need to carry your own stand or display, depending on what the local market provides. During the day, you will need to be present and charming throughout the day, and even your lunch break may be a rushed sandwich while sitting behind the produce you're selling. All the same, this hard work is worth it––you get better returns for your retailing the food produce than participating in the food auction and wholesaling to a supermarket chain.

It's a good idea to make friends quickly at the market, as these people will cover for you when you need a bathroom break or need to dash off to get change. In turn, they'll expect the same cover from you.  Are you planning on doing this alone or with a friend or partner? It's easier when at least two of you share the effort.;  , Farmers markets tend to sell fresh grown produce (all sorts of vegetables and fruit, nuts and seeds, etc.), freshly killed meat products, fresh fish, home or artisan baked goods, drinks (hot or cold) and homemade foods such as jams and jellies, patés - pahtaes (meat spreads), terrines - tuhreens (chopped and cooked meats, fish or vegetables to serve cold), jerky, pickles, sauces, condiments, etc. Some things to bear in mind include:  Advertise that you grow food in a special way to increase its appeal and value to customers. Such as, are you an organic or conventional grower?  Arrange for the appropriate transportation for getting your food to market. It's no good growing a lovely crop of peas and pumpkins and not being able to get them to market for want of a van, trailer or large car. If you don't have appropriate transportation, is there someone else who'd be able and happy to help?  Sell specialty cottage industry products only -- if those could sell well -- such as homemade soaps, beauty products, leather or wood products, herbs, sewn or knitted goods, clothing, etc. -- or spare a part of your stall for them while still selling food items.  Beware of farmers markets that are very purist about what is sold and so prefer only fresh food; it all depends on where you live and what people consider makes a farmers market.  If you're a food vendor (which most people are), you will likely need to get certified, if you serve foods. Know what rules exist in relation to growing, producing, serving and/or selling foods. Many jurisdictions have strict laws against selling food items from home kitchens, although in recognition of the increasing desire of people to sell and buy homemade food products, some of these restrictions are starting to be relaxed again. If you need to use a commercial kitchen space, can you organize a cooperative to share with another person or group of people also selling at the market?  Know how to avoid potential hazards when making homemade food by using correct procedures, such as sterilizing bottles and using high heat, etc. If you're not sure, read up on the food type before deciding that you'll include it as part of your stall––no point having jams and salsa--if you can't be bothered going through the hassle of sterilizing and sealing properly.  If you're certified by a health board or similar agency, expect officials to come for inspections when the market is on. Keep everything neat, tidy and clean, using proper head-coverings, rubber/plastic gloves. If you have any violations, then you may be asked to leave, at least for that one market, until everything gets sorted out.  This person (or perhaps even a committee) will tell you what the rules are for becoming a part of the market. In some cases, it will be quite formal, and you'll need to submit to an interview to convince the other owners and operators that you are a worthy participant, likely to sell quality produce. Find out whether there is a cooperative you can join––cooperatives provide power in numbers that also helps to cover marketing and sales and distribution even beyond the market.  Have a sales pitch already prepared in advance. You're going to fare better, if you present as confident and already decided on what it is you want to contribute to the market.  Check out the potential competition before you go. Although most farmers markets have a cooperative spirit, there is no point in being the fifteenth stall selling berries as there won't be enough customers to go around. Think of ways to add value to your produce--if this is an issue, such as turning those berries into berry milkshakes. Or perhaps turn your stall into a cooking class, showing people 101 ways to do things with the berries they've bought from you or others, all for a small fee.  Expect the market to provide you with some information too. Ask how many customers there are, what seasonal fluctuations exist, whether there are costs to maintaining a stall (such as having to pay, even if you don't turn up one time) and what insurance is provided to cover public liability.  Is the market under cover or outdoors? Some markets have a system of being outdoors when the weather is fine but moving under cover, if it is inclement. A lack of cover may affect your decision to participate.  Will have a table with chairs, a stand, a tent or just your product sitting on something simple like a trailer or bales of hay? Depending on what you decide will be your display method, you will need to purchase certain items, such as: folding chairs, trestle table, display tent, canopy or large umbrella, stands, tablecloths, money holder and a calculator. In some cases you might be in a position to accept credit card transactions, such as using a portable point of sale machine or even cell phones. However, remember that cash is king at the farmers market, and many provide ATMs for cash withdrawals, so you might not want to go to this added expense.  Whatever you choose to keep your money in, make sure it is secure and always in your sight. Many vendors choose to carry cash in a bum bag worn around the waist. If you're innovative, you can even divide the bum bag up into coins and notes and spare change.  You won't have time to pack or pick on the day of the market––usually it'll be all you can do to tumble out of bed and get there nice and early. The best approach is to prepare all the produce and pack the car or van by the night before, ready for an early leave. The exception to this may be, if you're happy to go to be very early the night before--and get up extremely early to bake or make food just before leaving.  In many cases, it's easiest to bake the day before, and if the food can handle it, even earlier than that. Try freezing some products and thawing them the night before.  Package goods that require it.  Pick produce the day before and have it loaded into boxes or other containers ready to go. Keep in a cool place ready for quick loading just before you leave.  If the market requires that you list the ingredients of prepared food, make tags or labels in the days before. It's a good idea to do this whether or not the market requires it, as customers like to know what's in their food. If you make labels on the computer, save them to a folder for future use––this will speed things up when you make the same product again.  Hook the trailer up to your car in readiness. If you would need to back out with a trailer, try to reverse it (turn it 180 degrees) and back it into your drive during the daylight, when it's easier to see. Or, leave it on the street in front of your house, if that's safe.  Organize the change. You'll need plenty of change, so head to the bank, if you haven't enough already.  Farmers markets are usually on a Saturday or Sunday so, even though it's a Friday or Saturday night, try to get to bed around 9:00 P.M. You're going to need all of the energy you can get by the time morning comes.  Go extra early, if it's your first time; so that you can get everything set up. As you become more experienced, you'll learn shortcuts that buy you a bit more time in bed but for the beginner, it's best to start early so that you can fix anything that might not go right the first time.  Always say a friendly 'Hi' or 'Good morning!' to people who walk in front of your booth. Be ready to discuss your produce in details, its origins, your passion for it and how fresh it is. The purpose of a farmers market is the ability to cut out the middleman and engage directly with customers so that they can grasp the love and care that has gone into producing the products you're offering. Be prepared to spend time chatting––it's part and parcel of being involved in a farmers market.  Smile, even if there are no cameras around. Customers like to come into a booth that has friendly people staffing it.  Be proud of what you're doing. You are part of the restoration of local foods being produced and sold directly to consumers without all the ineffectiveness and distancing the larger food sales chain has brought into play. You are helping to build community, create a livelihood for yourself and maybe for others, and you are helping people eat the healthy food that they deserve.  ","make a checklist of everything that you will need, in order to be prepared. decide what you're going to sell. get certified by the board of health in your county or area. get in touch with the owner, master or organizer of the market. once you're accepted as part of the farmers market, plan how your setting will look. prepare the day before the market. get to bed early!, wake up early the morning of the market. engage your customers.

"You don't have to be a fashion designer to make your own clothing. Working from a pattern makes sewing your own wardrobe relatively simple. Check out your local fabric store for some wild, off-beat patterns you wouldn't find on store-bought clothes. As your skill-level increases, you may even decide to design pieces from scratch without an existing sewing pattern.  Are you tired of seeing the same old T-shirt designs? Make custom shirts that nobody else in the world can wear.  If you have a business or studio, design T-shirts with its name and logo. If the shirts are eye-catching, wearing them can get complete strangers interested in your art.  Find original buttons or add faux jewels to your clothes.

"If using fresh asparagus instead of frozen asparagus, make sure the spears you choose, are firm and bright green. The tips should also be firmly packed together.Asparagus spears can be fat or skinny. Thicker spears takes a little longer to cook, but both are equally flavorful and nutritious. No matter, which you choose, though, the spears should be evenly sized.;  , Clean the asparagus by rinsing them thoroughly under cold, running water, gently rubbing the tips to loosen any dirt, sand, or debris.  Asparagus is grown in sandy soil and usually has some debris in the tips. As such, a thorough rinsing is important.  Pat dry with paper towels once rinsed.  Use your hands or a knife to snap off the bottom 1/3 of each spear.  Usually, this will be about 1 to 1.5 inches (2.5 to 3.8 cm).  These ends are especially woody and are generally not very appetizing.  You should be able to roughly estimate where the right breaking point is by gently bending the spear a few times near the bottom. The point at which the stalk turns tender will usually be the easiest, most natural breaking point, and you can usually break the bottoms off at this point with your hands.  Use a vegetable peeler to scrape off the rough scales or knobs on the outside each stalk.  This is not necessary, but it does give the spears a clean look. It can also be especially good if you are using thick asparagus.  You only need to peel the lower 2 inches (5 cm) or so of the spear.  ","choose fresh asparagus. rinse the spears in cold water. snap off the base of each spear. peel off the scales at the bottom of each spear. "
"You've noticed your skin is sensitive, but getting a little more information on what, exactly, is going on with your skin can be very helpful when you are trying to choose the best products for your skin.  If you have acne-prone skin, skin that is especially oily, or skin that has very dry patches, you will need to address those concerns with products formulated for those skin types.  Sensitive skin is prone to irritation, so it's important to use as few products as possible in your skincare routine. Identify your main issues of concern, and address those, but be careful about causing additional issues by using too many products.;  , There are many products on the market, but your sensitive skin is unlikely to react well to a long process of trial-and-error to find the right one. Instead, try these suggestions for sensitive skin.  Choose products that are fragrance-free and alcohol-free to minimize irritation.Look for products that say 'sensitive' on the label, like Olay Foaming Face Wash.Despite its title, this product does not create much of a lather. In general, the more foam a product creates, the more it will strip your skin of its protective barrier oils, so products with just a touch of lather or none at all are ideal. Other brands with cleansers for sensitive skin include Clinique, Cetaphil, CeraVe, Eucerin, and Avène.Try facial wipes. Wipes are convenient and if you find that they are too harsh for your skin, you can moisten them with water to dilute the ingredients. Many wipes contain fragrances and alcohol, so look for one without these products, like Simple Oil Balancing face wipes.Opt out of 'soaps' altogether. If you do not get especially dirty on a day-to-day basis, there is no need to use a soap product. Warm water and a washcloth can gently clean your facial skin. Another great option is coconut oil. A small amount rubbed all over the face and removed with warm, wet washcloth can cleanse the skin and also remove even stubborn make-up.  Be cautious when exfoliating. If your skin is sensitive, don't exfoliate more than once or twice weekly. If you have other skin issues, such as inflammatory acne, you will want to speak with a dermatologist before attempting to exfoliate.  Remember that just because a product works well for someone else with sensitive skin, it might not work well for you. Additionally, more expensive products are not necessarily better than cheaper ones.  Washing your face more often than is necessary strips your skin of its natural protective barrier and leaves it dry and vulnerable to irritation. You should only wash your face once or twice a day.Wash your face at the end of the day, just before bed, and then immediately apply a mild moisturizer or cream. Be sure to remove all makeup or other products from your skin.  In the morning, unless you have very oily skin, you do not need to wash your face. Instead, rub some lukewarm water on your face and then pat dry with a towel. After a night of sleeping on a clean pillow without makeup, you don't need to use a harsh cleanser., The right temperature of water is crucial to avoid irritating your skin. Warm or cool water is usually best for washing your face.  Hot water will strip your skin of its natural protective oils and can also scald it.  While it is a myth that cold water closes your pores, it can help to keep them from producing excess oil, so if that is one of your skincare concerns, consider using cold water., While some products may have different instructions, generally the process is similar regardless of what type of product you choose.  Splash cool or warm water on your face. This will help the product penetrate the oil and dirt on your face.  Apply a very small amount of the product to your fingertips. In general, a pea-sized amount should do, although some products do not spread as well as others so you may need more. Some people prefer to use a washcloth, but unless it is very soft and you use a very light touch, the fibers on a washcloth can be abrasive to sensitive skin.  Rub the product between your hands until it forms a lather (or, if you have a non-lathering product, until the product is evenly distributed between your hands). Then, beginning with your forehead, massage the product gently into the moist skin on your face. Avoid your eye and lip areas and nostrils.  Splash the water onto your face and gently rub with your hands until the soap is removed.  Be sure to remove all the product from your skin. Again, using a washcloth is not recommended for sensitive skin.  Dry with a clean, soft towel, using a patting motion rather than rubbing in order to protect the skin from abrasion.  Most people with sensitive skin need a protective layer to re-hydrate the skin after cleansing. Look for products marked specifically for sensitive skin, which tend to be fragrance-free and free of harsh chemicals.  If you will be outdoors at all, even to drive a car, be sure that you use a product with sunscreen. Choose a sunscreen offering broad spectrum coverage and an SPF of 30.If your skin is sensitive to chemical sunscreens, try a broad spectrum sunscreen containing a physical blocker like zinc oxide or titanium dioxide, which tends to be gentle on sensitive skin.Other gentle moisturizers that often work well for people with sensitive skin include Cetaphil Moisturizing Lotion for oily to normal skin or Bare Minerals Purely Nourishing Cream for very dry skin.  While you may need certain products to address your skin care concerns, a minimalist skincare routine is best for people with sensitive skin.If you have no other major issues with your skin (like eczema, acne, or extreme oiliness or dryness), it is possible that you can reduce your skincare routine to a mild face wash, a sunscreen, and a moisturizer. In some cases, the sunscreen and moisturizer might be the same product.  Remember that cosmetic products can also be irritating, so choose formulas that are fragrance-free, non-comedogenic (that is, won't clog your pores), and with as few ingredients as possible. Some brands that claim to be good for sensitive skin include Clinique and bareMinerals.  It's possible that your skin's sensitivity is caused by an allergy or similar concern, which can be treated or managed with lifestyle changes.  If the skin on your face or lips is chronically itchy, dry (especially in patches), or red and inflamed, it's possible that environmental allergens (pets, dust, ragweed, etc.) might be to blame. Typically, an allergic reaction won't be localized to your face, so itchy skin on your hands, arms, knees, or other areas might be an indication of an allergy.  Some food allergies, like a gluten or milk allergies, can cause reactions in the skin. Even nut allergies can manifest as hives, itchy skin, or redness around the mouth. An allergist (a doctor specializing in allergies) can help you determine if your sensitive skin is caused by environmental or food allergies by giving you skin-prick or patch test.  It's possible that your skin's sensitivity is caused by an allergy or sensitivity to the products that you use on your face or around your home, which can be managed by switching products.  If you have itchy, red, uncomfortable, or inflamed skin on your face or lips, it's possible that you have an allergy or sensitivity to a product that you use. Consider whether your face wash, scrub, toner, sunscreen, moisturizer, cosmetics, lip balm, or any other product that comes into contact with your face might be causing a reaction. You can try eliminating products individually for about a week each, in order to see if you have any improvement of your symptoms.  You might also have an allergy or sensitivity to products that you use, such as your laundry detergent, or a perfume or hand lotion that might come in contact with your face. There is also the possibility that a partner's products (cosmetics or after shave, for instance) might be causing a reaction on your skin.  It has been observed that children with sensitive skin or atopic dermatitis may be prone to food allergies. You may want to have a skin prick test to see if food allergies are causing your dermatitis or sensitive skin.  Most people who say they have sensitive skin never see a dermatologist. If that describes you, it is possible that you are living with a skin condition that is treatable.Some issues that seem like mere skin sensitivity are actually eczema, psoriasis, rosacea, or other skin issues. Each of these skin conditions has its own root cause and treatment plan.If you've never been to a dermatologist, it's a good idea to visit one to rule out other skin conditions. If you do find out you have a skin condition, the dermatologist can prescribe creams or oral medications to treat it.  Eczema or atopic dermatitis can be treated a number of way including creams to affect the immune system, antibiotics to prevent infection, antihistamine to stop itching, and stress modifications.  ","identify your skin issues. choose the right cleanser. know when to use it. use warm or cool water. wash your face. rinse well with warm or cool water. apply a gentle moisturizer. avoid unnecessary products. determine if your skin's sensitivity has environmental causes. determine if you are allergic to your products. determine if you have other dermatological issues. "
"Everyone deserves respect, and the best way to earn it is to show it to other people. You need to respect everyone in your school, including younger students, upperclassmen, friends, strangers, and teachers. Don’t make fun of, tease, or gossip about your peers.Respect other people’s property as well. Never take something that isn’t yours, and if someone lends you something be sure to return it in the condition you received it.;  , If you see someone, whether it’s a friend or a stranger, being bullied, step in and stand up for the person. Similarly, if you’re being bullied, stand up for yourself. Your peers will respect you for standing up for yourself as well as helping others. The worst thing you can do is stand by when someone is being bullied, and not take action.For example, say to the bully “Hey, man, that’s not cool. You shouldn’t talk to Susie like that.”  , Your peers will respect you if you are someone whom people can come to and feel like they are being genuinely heard. If a friend or classmate wants to talk to you about something, give them your full attention, make eye contact, and demonstrate empathy.For instance, if a classmate tells you that her dog just died, say something like “Wow, I’m really sorry to hear that. I remember how hard it was when my dog, Tally, died last year. Is there anything I can do to help?”  , You can demonstrate kindness by holding the door for the person behind you or helping a peer pick up the books they dropped. Don’t single someone out, tease them, or spread rumors. Doing so will not earn you respect from your classmates., Greet people when you see them and acknowledge them when they are speaking to you. Say “please” and “thank you” often. You should also say “excuse me” and always apologize when necessary.For instance, if you bump into someone in the hallway and they drop their books, help them pick them up. Say “I’m sorry Jack, I didn’t see you there. Let me help you.”  , It can be difficult to be the bigger person in a tough situation, but your peers will certainly respect you for it. If someone attacks or pushes you, be mature and handle the situation the right way. Don’t be afraid to talk to a teacher or counselor if you feel you don’t have the tools or the authority to handle the situation correctly.  For example, if a classmate insults you, laugh it off or walk away. Don’t stoop to their level by calling them names or getting into a physical fight.  Being a leader will gain the respect of your peers. Leaders are confident and prepared for all situations. To show your peers you are a leader, you can become the captain of a team or club, join the student council/government, or offer to tutor others in areas you excel in., When people recognize that you are active in school teams or groups, they will respect your efforts and see you as a leader. Try out for the soccer team, join the chess club, or become a member of the drama club.  People who are open-minded earn more respect than those that are close-minded and think their way is the only right way to do something. Accept that people come from different backgrounds, religions, and cultures, and while these factors may make people different, they don’t make them better or worse than anyone else., If you are an asocial person, then you may have a hard time getting the respect you may feel you want from your fellows and peers. Try to find out what you may have in common with your peers, such as strong organizational skills, a talent for basketball, or a love for sci-fi.  Take small steps to relate to others, such as commenting on a classmate’s shirt if it has your favorite band logo on it.  Starting a conversation with someone you don’t know very well can seem daunting. However, being friendly to others and striking up a conversation can help you earn respect. It’s as easy as sharing something funny that happened to you, or asking about an assignment or project.  For example, say “Wow, I’m super tired. I was up late cleaning because my dog knocked over a can of paint in the living room!”  You could also say “Have you started your history project yet? I’m thinking of doing mine on the Titanic.”  , Both teachers and peers will give you criticism during your time at school. If the criticism is constructive, rather than blatantly rude, say something like, “Wow, thanks for pointing that out, I didn’t notice it before.” Likewise, when someone compliments you, don’t laugh or brush it off. Instead, show the person that you appreciate their words.  For instance, if someone compliments your outfit, say something like “Thank you! I got this at T.J. Maxx. Green is my favorite color.”  , People who lie will quickly lose the respect of their friends and peers. If you are seen as untrustworthy, it’s hard to be respected. Tell the truth, and own up to it when you make a mistake. Taking responsibility for your words and actions goes a long toward showing others that you are mature and deserve their respect., It’s important that you stay true to yourself, and don’t let others influence you negatively. Don’t feel as though you have to change your interests or opinions based on what others like. A strong sense of self will earn the respect of others.  For instance, if everyone in your peer group is eating pizza for lunch, and you don’t like pizza, don’t feel as though you have to eat it too. Select what you like, and if someone comments on it, simply say “I’m not a big fan of pizza. I like getting my lunch from the salad bar better.”  , Show people what you are good at, and encourage them to do the same. Everyone has unique skills, so don’t worry if you aren’t good at everything you try. Simply showcase the things you do well, and appreciate others that can do things that you may struggle with.For example, if you are a skilled runner, join the track or cross-country team.  If someone you know has a great voice, encourage them to join the choir or try out for the spring musical.  Intelligence is a highly respected trait, so don’t be afraid of letting people see your smart side. You should give all your schoolwork maximum effort, volunteer answers in class, and offer to tutor a student having trouble with something you understand well. Don’t brag or boast about your intelligence, though, just let it speak for itself.  Make others laugh by telling them a good joke or a funny story. You can even do an Internet search for funny jokes so you have a few on hand at any given time. Just avoid jokes that demean or make fun of different genders or racial groups.  Confidence goes hand in hand with respect. Accept and love yourself for you who are, flaws and all. Dress in clothes that make you feel good and always have a smile ready to share with friends or peers., This a no-brainer, because participating means you're letting your voice be heard in front of your whole class. If you have a difficult time answering questions posed by your teacher, try asking questions instead. Other students who were wondering the same thing will be glad you brought up the topic., Strong communication skills can help you earn your peers’ respect. If you have difficulty getting your point across, try some exercises to help you strengthen your skills. For example, read a newspaper or magazine article and practice summarizing it. This will help you weed out unnecessary information while providing the key points., Think about how others will react to your actions, and about how your actions make you look to others. Don’t tell jokes that are in bad taste, gossip, or spread rumors. Avoid arguing with your peers and never resort to physical altercations.  ","respect everyone at school. stand up for yourself and others. listen actively to others. show kindness and helpfulness. use your manners. show your maturity. show your leadership skills. join organizational teams, clubs, or groups. be open to new ideas. show others that you relate to them. strike up a conversation with your classmates. accept criticism and compliments graciously. tell the truth. stay true to yourself. share your talents. show your smarts. demonstrate your humor. be confident. participate in class. learn to speak well. avoid inappropriate behavior.

"Bonus points if your eyes and smirk says, “I’m trouble. Come get me.”;  , The truth is, like most men, women want to date men who are fit. However, this isn’t always the rule. Really, women just want to see the product before they go and purchase it. If you have a nice body, then a shot of you playing tennis or running on the beach are always good shots.  So if you have a cute tush and can accentuate it by wearing tight pants, go for it. But just remember, no shots of your privates. Yes, there’s a difference between private shots and butt shots. Most men post private shots and it’s old. But women find “cute butts” – well – cute. But ONLY if they really are cute.  So go ahead and post some goofy photos of you being a clown (but not too goofy).  , Studies have shown that the first thing women look at on a man is his eyes. And for god sake whatever you do…don’t wear your sunglasses at night!!!  ","women want to see a headshot of your face, with nice eyes and a nice smile. female online daters also want to see a full body shot so they can see your actual physique. women also have a thing for nice butts. women on dating sites like sexsearch.com also want to see photos of you showing off your fun side. really, women just want to see that you look like a nice, normal, friendly, and approachable guy…they don’t want to date someone who looks like they belong in an insane asylum, you feel us? , if you’re going to wear shades in your photo, just make sure you have an additional photo of yourself without wearing any shades.

"As you send her those signals, see what she does. If she blushes or smiles, you're on the right track.  If she seems confused, don't fret. You may just be going too fast. Jog back a bit and take it slow.  If she's not reciprocating, it's not the right moment. Be patient. It may have nothing to do with you.  If you're in the middle of an action movie and she's so entranced the popcorn is missing her mouth, it's not the right time. Use your own senses of whether or not to get close and personal.  If it's not happening, create it. Walk her to her door, take her somewhere new, or learn to play her favorite song.  Look at her eyes and lips. Getting impatient or distracted (or, God forbid, focusing on other parts of her body) may scare her away.  Focusing will make her easier to read. Knowing if a girl wants to kiss is half the battle.  If she senses you're even the slightest bit unhappy, she may be not want to take the risk. Remember: she's reading you, too!  Smiling will put both of you in a better mood. It's contagious and tricks the mind.  The moment is good whether she kisses you or not. Even if she doesn't now, you're putting in time for later.  It's easy to sense when someone is nervous. Your heart will race and you'll perspire. Remember to breathe.  ","watch her reactions. make sure the moment is right. focus. smile. relax. "
"The takeoff ramp needs to be curved up to a steep lip about 45-75 degrees at the top, or else you overshoot and crash.  Remember that when you compact the dirt mounds, they get smaller. One good way not to push the wheelbarrow all the time is to put one and half times what you desire to have as the height of the jump (for example, a beginner that wants a jump 3 feet high actually needs 4.5 feet of dirt because of the loss from compaction) so you won't waste time shoveling again and pushing that wheelbarrow every time you need a little dirt.  Make the lip of the jump flat so you can get as much air as possible.  ;  , Another good idea is to use a roller this will help compact your jump and make them smoother and better. If the spaded shovel doesn't help just get a compacter and pack it down.  In addition, it makes the dirt more malleable.  Make them progressively bigger. Add berms and rollers to maintain and gather speed.  If in a tight area, just land & slow down, turn around, and do it again.  ","mound rocks and logs in two piles and add dirt on top of it about as high as your skill level (2-3 feet for beginners and 5-9 feet for experts, the gap (if you feel like you are certain to crash, do a jump instead) needs to be 2–5 feet (0.6–1.5 m) for beginners and 8–15 feet (2.4–4.6 m) for experts). compact the ramps down by hitting them with a flat spade or stamping on them. add water to the dirt jump so it doesn't become dusty and break apart in clumps, and so it's easier to pack down. make multiple jumps in a row, also known as a rhythm section. focus on a set up that flows.

"You should read your Bible twice a day, in the morning and in the evening. If you focus just on God for 5-10 minutes, it really helps. Try to find time to read a verse or two from the Bible, and concentrate on what God is saying in the those verses.;  , Pray to him when you feel happy, sad, angry, scared, or just bored. Tell him your feelings and don't hold back on it. Not only are you strengthening your relationship with God, but it also really makes you feel better when you have someone to talk to.  If you have a conflict, even if it is something as simple as, 'I wonder if I should eat this last slice of cake?' You should ask yourself if what Jesus would do in this conflict. So, Jesus would probably not take that last slice of cake, but let someone else have it.  A lot of times in our lives, we are tempted to do things we know we shouldn't do. Even though it's hard, the best thing to do is avoid it. Just walk away if the temptation is hard, and if it just keeps coming, pray to God to help lift your temptation, and find something to distract yourself. If someone is peer pressuring you to do something that isn't right, you should just tell them to stop, and walk away from it.  It doesn't matter what type of Christian you are. There is a church out there for you. Attend any services you can, and make sure you take notes on the sermon. Also, attending a Sunday School helps, too. Most churches have Sunday Schools for adults and kids.  ","read your bible. pray to god. what would jesus do?, avoid temptation. go to church. "
"Net electric flux through a closed surface with enclosed charge q is the integral of the dot product between the electric field and the instantaneous surface area vector.  The integral of the instantaneous surface area is simply the surface area vector.  The electric field at a distance outside a Gaussian surface will be constant at that specific distance.  Choose one that best fits its dimensions.  A solid sphere or spherical shell of charge Q would require the use of a sphere, while a line or rod of charge would require a cylinder.  A solid sphere or hollow spherical shell with uniform charge distribution can be treated as if all charge were concentrated at the center (a point charge), therefore the radius of your Gaussian surface would be the radius of your sphere plus the distance away from the sphere's surface.  Frequent formulas are 4pi r squared and pi r squared.  ,  With the proper Gaussian surface, the electric field and surface area vectors will nearly always be parallel.  ","know the formula for the electric flux through a closed surface. draw an imaginary gaussian surface around your charge. determine the surface area of your gaussian surface.determine the electric field going through your gaussian surface. multiply the magnitude of your surface area vector by the magnitude of your electric field vector and the cosine of the angle between them.do not forget to add the proper units for electric flux.

"After having a candid conversation, develop a plan, either together or separately, to avoid these problems. For instance, if they were mad at you for interrupting them in a meeting, then put forth an effort to be more patient and to be a better listener., The person you have wronged might need a bit of time to reflect on what happened as well as the apology. Give them that time. Don’t blow their phone up continuing to ask for forgiveness; remember that you have already done that. You can check in every few days, if you haven’t heard from them, but after a few weeks, avoid always being the first to reach out., Don’t badmouth them or gossip about them to others, especially if you are coworkers. Be cordial when you see them and greet them with a “hello” and a smile.

"Unlike a party at home, you will find it much harder to keep foods cold or warm enough to fend off bacterial growth. You can minimize the risk of bacterial contamination of food by choosing foods that travel well outdoors. Some examples include:  Dry food: Bread, rolls, crackers, etc. are usually safe choices. It's what you add to them that requires care, such as hot dogs, luncheon meats and salads.  Food high in sugar: Sugar acts as a preservative and, in conjunction with dryness, can make foods safe for the tailgate party. For example, cake (no cream filling), cookies and candies.  Fresh fruits and vegetables: Provided these are washed and handled properly, they are generally safe to enjoy at the tailgate party.;  , Food that contains meat, milk and egg can go bad quickly when not refrigerated or cooked properly. These are the foods to be most careful with.  Other foods that are potentially hazardous unless great care is taken to keep them at the right temperature include rice, custard, potatoes, puddings and stuffing. Each of these food types needs to be kept and served at the right temperature.  Food that is packaged individually for each person, wrapped in food grade plastic and kept at the right temperature tends to be a safe option for tailgate occasions. Individual packaging minimizes the amount of handling from other people during the party.  Cream-based dips are not a great idea at a tailgate party––many people dipping into the same dip and the need to leave the item out in the open can lead to it fast becoming a hazardous food item. On the other hand, an individual tomato-based dip, such as salsa, can be a great way to share around those corn chips.  Make salsa at home, then place individual portions into separate containers with lids. Keep refrigerated and hand out straight from the cooler just when everyone is ready to dip their chips.  ","choose food that is less likely to cause problems. be careful with foods that can quickly turn bad. choose pre-packaged single-serves. "
"Greet each morning with a ritual. Try this one, suggested by the Dalai Lama: “Today I am fortunate to have woken up, I am alive, I have a precious human life, I am not going to waste it. I am going to use all my energies to develop myself, to expand my heart out to others, to achieve enlightenment for the benefit of all beings, I am going to have kind thoughts towards others, I am not going to get angry or think badly about others, I am going to benefit others as much as I can.” Then, when you’ve done this, try one of the practices below.;  , The first step in cultivating compassion, is to develop empathy for your fellow human beings and yourself. Many of us believe that we have empathy, and on some level nearly all of us do. But many times we are centered on ourselves and we let our sense of empathy get rusty. Try this practice: Imagine that a loved one is suffering. Something terrible has happened to him or her. Now try to imagine the pain they are going through. Imagine the suffering in as much detail as possible. After doing this practice for a couple of weeks, you should try moving on to imagining the suffering of others you know, not just those who are close to you.  This means that you should experience the other persons suffering or emotions from that persons frame of reference, meaning as if you are in that persons shoes.  To keep empathy from turning into sympathy, keep your focus on the other person, rather than allowing your empathy to shift your focus to your own experience and memory of suffering., Instead of recognizing the differences between yourself and others, try to recognize what you have in common. At the root of it all, we are all human beings. We need food, and shelter, and love. We crave attention, and recognition, and affection, and above all, happiness. Reflect on these commonalities you have with every other human being, and ignore the differences. One favorite exercise comes from a great article from Ode Magazine — it’s a five-step exercise to try when you meet friends and strangers. Do it discreetly and try to do all the steps with the same person. With your attention geared to the other person, tell yourself:Step 1: “Just like me, this person is seeking happiness in his/her life.”  Step 2: “Just like me, this person is trying to avoid suffering in his/her life.”  Step 3: “Just like me, this person has known sadness, loneliness and despair.”  Step 4: “Just like me, this person is seeking to fulfill his/her needs.”  Step 5: “Just like me, this person is learning about life.”  , Once you can empathize with another person, and understand his humanity and suffering, the next step is to want that person to be free from suffering. This is the heart of compassion — actually the definition of it. Try this exercise: Imagine the suffering of a human being you’ve met recently. Now imagine that you are the one going through that suffering. Reflect on how much you would like that suffering to end. Reflect on how happy you would be if another human being desired your suffering to end, and acted upon it. Open your heart to that human being and if you feel even a little that you’d want their suffering to end, reflect on that feeling. That’s the feeling that you want to develop. With constant practice, that feeling can be grown and nurtured.  A study suggests that the more you meditate on compassion, the more your brain reorganizes itself to feel empathy towards others.  Now that you’ve gotten good at the fourth practice, take the exercise a step further. Imagine again the suffering of someone you know or met recently. Imagine again that you are that person, and are going through that suffering. Now imagine that another human being would like your suffering to end — perhaps your mother or another loved one. What would you like for that person to do to end your suffering? Now reverse roles: you are the person who desires for the other person’s suffering to end. Imagine that you do something to help ease the suffering, or end it completely. Once you get good at this stage, practice doing something small each day to help end the suffering of others, even in a tiny way. Even a smile, or a kind word, or doing an errand or chore, or just talking about a problem with another person. Practice doing something kind to help ease the suffering of others. When you are good at this, find a way to make it a daily practice, and eventually a throughout-the-day practice.  The final stage in these compassion practices is to not only want to ease the suffering of those we love and meet, but even those who mistreat us. When we encounter someone who mistreats us, instead of acting in anger, withdraw. Later, when you are calm and more detached, reflect on that person who mistreated you. Try to imagine the background of that person. Try to imagine what that person was taught as a child. Try to imagine the day or week that person was going through, and what kind of bad things had happened to that person. Try to imagine the mood and state of mind that person was in — the suffering that person must have been going through to mistreat you that way. And understand that their action was not about you, but about what they were going through. Now think some more about the suffering of that poor person, and see if you can imagine trying to stop the suffering of that person. And then reflect that if you mistreated someone, and they acted with kindness and compassion toward you, whether that would make you less likely to mistreat that person the next time, and more likely to be kind to that person. Once you have mastered this practice of reflection, try acting with compassion and understanding the next time a person mistreats you. Do it in little doses, until you are good at it. Practice makes perfect.  It will take time to manage your emotions to the extent that you can practice full compassion, but the following techniques will help; in addition, people who practiced them in a study produced 100 percent more DHEA, which is a hormone that counteracts the aging process, and 23 percent less cortisol — the “stress hormone.”Cut-through: Observe your feelings, focusing on your heart. Pretend you're someone outside of the situation, giving yourself advice like 'Relax, it's no big deal.' Imagine your negative feelings getting absorbed and diffused by your heart. This will help you transform rather than repress your negative feelings.Heart lock-in: Quiet your mind and focus your attention on your heart. Tap into feelings that you have towards someone or something you love easily, and try to stay with that feeling for ten or fifteen minutes. Then imagine sending those feelings to yourself and others.You may also want to read How to Forgive.  It is highly recommended that you take a few minutes before you go to bed to reflect upon your day. Think about the people you met and talked to, and how you treated each other. Think about your goal that you stated this morning, to act with compassion towards others. How well did you do? What could you do better? What did you learn from your experiences today? And if you have time, try one of the above practices and exercises.  ","develop a morning ritual. practice empathy. practice commonalities. practice relief of suffering. practice the act of kindness. move beyond to practice compassion for those who mistreat us. develop an evening routine.

"If you spill on a leatherette surface, the best thing to do is wipe up the spill immediately using a damp cotton or wool cloth. This will help to prevent the development of stains.For example, if your child spills juice on your leatherette car interior, you can dip a cotton cloth in water, wring out the water so the cloth is damp, and then wipe down the surface with the cloth.  Once the spill has been wiped up, dry the leatherette using a clean dry cloth.  In some cases you may not be able to remove a stain by simply wiping the leatherette with warm water. In these cases you will need to use a soap and water mixture. In a small bowl, combine warm water with a tablespoon of mild dish soap or hand soap., Then, dip a soft cloth into the water and soap mixture and wring it out so that the cloth is damp, but not dripping wet. Using the damp cloth, wipe the entire leatherette surface with soapy water., After you have wiped the entire surface with soapy water, take a new cloth and dip it in a bowl of plain water. Wring out the towel so that it is damp, but not dripping wet. Once the cloth is wet, wipe the entire leatherette surface.

"Was it your fault or someone else's? Identify the harmful causes of being too angry. Anger is an important part of health; when used being properly such as anger motivates you when your studying, it motivates you when you're down. But when used in physical response, it is dangerous and can ruin the person from within so never try to respond physically. When you're exercising, anger can give you that boost you need.;  , Do not think you can go straight into training, you need have the correct form of exercise and some kind of routine. Eating a healthy diet too will benefit your body and make you stronger. So try doing research on that.  When you have the basics down, decide which exercises to do, such as isolation exercises or compound exercises. Compound exercises are good because they help to grow more muscle then isolation exercises. This is where the anger part comes in. If you normally you do 10 reps, remember when you got beaten up, you wanted to be stronger and got angry that you were not strong enough. When you recall thoughts that made you angry, it urges you onto doing more than 10 reps.  Be a fighter and carry on, after the outburst of energy, you feel giving up saying you can never achieve but you're wrong, you can. You can decide your own faith, no one can decide it for you. Ask yourself 'Do I really want to be strong? If I do, why am I giving up, I should be carrying on!'.  If you can manage all of your tasks by yourself, then there is no need for you to owe anybody anything. Try to do your own work without interrupting others as some people take advantage of this later on (but not all) so try to mind your own business. Remember how you will feel when you keep asking for help and annoying those around you, you don't want to be rejected so try to do your own work and be kind, thoughtful and honest.  Running with soothing music on to help you can give you the extra edge as you want to do well but it also calms you down when you're listening to music.  Using your determination, try to become the strongest as you will find out that generally people make more friends with strong people, but do not use your strength to hurt someone, protect someone with your strength.  ","know what anger is and why you get angry. research. train. carry on. be self sufficient. run. become the strongest. "
"If you're not sure which university will suit you, begin at the beginning. Look for universities worldwide using a searchable database of universities around the world, such as Universities Worldwide, Brain Track College and University Directory, etc. Note that these sites are provided to help you, this is not an endorsement of them or any other site - do your own investigations.;  , If you don't know where to start, ask for help from a librarian.

"Concentrate on stand up techniques but be able to hold your own in mat work. Currently, the emphasis is on judo being a spectator sport with a lot of action. A lot of action translates to constant movement and lots of throwing techniques rather than arm bars, pins and chokes.  Watch You Tube videos of matches and model your style from top level competitors.  Learn the rules of competition by asking the referees, your teacher and reading. Winning is all that matters, know the rules and be clever. Do whatever it takes.;  , It's a good idea to choose one that participates in the most tournaments, so that you can enter additional tournaments on your own or with other members of your club. Your tournament life will be short, after you get older it will be impractical to risk injury, so live in the moment and compete as much as possible.  Besides participating in tournaments, watch videos of the Olympic and world championship tournaments.  You must be in great condition and be able to act without hesitation when your opponent is vulnerable. The person without a grip is at a big disadvantage.  Study and develop this technique. Be patient when coming to grips. If you are not fighting (sparring) for a grip, like the top Judo players, your play has a big hole that you should work on.  In tournaments, do not insist on the traditional sleeve and lapel grip. Do supplementary work by applying force with your forearms, crook of the elbow, hands close together, grasping thick bars, and from awkward positions (but mechanically sound positions, so as to avoid injury).  It is vital to thoroughly develop from there, like a flow chart, in order to be able to quickly respond to the myriad situations that can––and will––happen. Here are a few important techniques to master:  Be able throw in all directions and modify your throws against all types of opponents. Do not excessively favor your dominant side.  Have a handful of throws that you specialize in, but be familiar with all of the throws used. With these throws, you can make combinations, feints and drawing schemes.  Prepare for all that can happen. Use all variations of your throws as is necessary. It's recommended that you read books about throwing techniques because they will provide a planned and thorough presentation of the many variations and contingencies.  Use techniques from other sports that were derived from martial arts and especially amateur wrestling but also sumo belt grabbing and arm leverage moves.  In competition, full scores are achieved with the thinnest of margins: do not expect to see much textbook application of techniques in tournaments. A point is a point, but if all points could be graded on a scale of one to ten, many points barely make the grade and are merely one, two or three. The end justifies the means.  Your opponent, when you are executing your throw, will not give you a clean fall. Instead, your opponent will neglect safety, wrap you like being tackled in football, and take you down too. Expect to complete your throw, with extreme follow-through and end up in an awkward situation and with your back turned to your opponent. With extreme follow-through, fall on your opponent and expect your opponent to fall on you too, if you wrap him up when he is trying to throw you. Proper break-falls are virtually ignored in competition.  At the completion of a throw, with extreme follow-through, and with your back turned to your opponent, you must turn and face your opponent.  When on the mat, to escape a pin, you must bridge and rotate out of the back on the mat position.  When being thrown, you must spin and fall on your knees to avoid having your opponent being awarded the score.  Do waist twists as a warm up, but do some waist twisting with much more resistance; be creative. Use a partner, weights, sandbags, bicycle inner tubes, something, anything to develop your waist muscles. Do twisting variations of exercises that you already do. Rotate your spine just a little, instead rotate your body around your spine.  You will be upside down and in all types of awkward positions, so get used to it and prepare for it: tournament judo is not like class judo.  When being thrown, you must reverse your position and not get thrown on your back. At the very least, practice cartwheels and do some upside down, body weight press-ups.  At risk to your elbows, you must take some falls on one arm to avoid giving your opponent the point. Relax with yoga headstands.  Do not replace your class with your supplementary training program though; going to the judo class is the priority.  Stretch, throughout the day and every day. Study stretching.  Form, in addition to stretching, can be done often, do it often. Practice simple and complex techniques and counters. Make a playbook, or a mental playbook, and go through the scenarios that can (and will) happen. Mental training can be done anywhere, so do it!  Complement your club workouts with a supplementary training routine.  Many Olympic athletes cycle their training, so do the same. Cycle everything, your strength, flexibility, skill, and psyche, and expect to get criticized by those who say they put 100 percent all the time. Your resources are limited, use them in a clever way.  If you can do 40 push ups year round, with cycling you would do just 30 push ups for most of the year and work up to doing 50 push ups 5 times a year such as in the wavelike pattern on the graph. The five times a year when your are very strong would be when you have a tournament.  Choose and plan your supplementary training very carefully and thoughtfully. Consider your time, finances, fighting style, available equipment, capabilities, recovery capability, and inclination. For example, if your tournament career will be ending soon, build your strength, focus on simple techniques and in tournaments attack like a tiger. But if you have many tournament ahead of you, gain experience and develop your skills.  Examples of supplementary training: weights, a partner, sandbags, running, wrestling, machines, bicycle tubes, gymnastics, drills, skill movements, etc, be creative.  Focus on tournaments and set your ego aside in practice. Be cunning––your buddies in practice may be your opponents in tournaments.  Do not show off in practice, have a lot in reserve for tournaments. Aggression wears on the nerves, there are many other aspects of judo that you can practice in regular practice sessions and especially against others who are not competitive.  Do not lose your humanity, your club mates are your friends.  In tournaments, lose your humanity, but do not try to hurt your opponent.  Body fat will not help you unless you are in the highest weight class.  You must be very sensitive to your limitations and avoid over-training. Be aware (your eyes focus with muscles, rest those muscles and your brain) and adjust to the changing conditions, do not perform like a robot. Get everything together by tournament time, plan it that way.  ","know what it takes to win. join a club. after securing a grip, it is attack, attack, attack. develop techniques based on your body type, inclination, etc. score a point and do not get caught up in technique. develop extreme follow-through. supplement your training with strong rotational core movements. go beyond the falling techniques you learned in class, and study gymnastics. develop skill, speed, power, flexibility, agility, and muscular and cardiovascular endurance and not necessarily in this order. cycle your training, very methodically, to coincide with your tournaments. do not be a club fighter, by winning in practice and losing in tournaments. compete in a weight class that your can keep your weight at, choosing a weight that will not affect your performance. have enough sleep before a tournament and enough rest on a daily basis.

"One of the Basenji’s most distinctive features is its forehead, which displays a Shar-Pei-like wrinkle at all times. This can lend a puzzled or anxious expression to its face, but it’s just the natural fold and texture of its skin.This wrinkle may seem more pronounced in puppies, who have more excess skin and folds. It will also be less noticeable in Basenjis with brindled, black, or tricolored coats.;  , Looking at a Basenji, you may recall the sharp, pointed ears of the ancient Egyptian god Anubis. This resemblance is not accidental: in fact, the Basenji is one of the most ancient dog breeds and appears in many Egyptian hieroglyphs as early as 4000 B.C.The Basenji’s ears stand at the top of the flat skull and point directly upward. Many experts argue that this adaptation derives from the fact that Basenjis use both sight and sound to hunt. It’s also thought that the large surface area of the ears helps to dissipate heat.  Basenjis are medium-sized dogs, measuring 16-17 inches at the shoulder and 16-17 inches from chest to buttocks. They are lightly-built dogs, weighing 22-24 pounds.Expect female Basenjis to fall on the lower end of height and weight averages, typically weighing one to two pounds less than males and standing one inch shorter.  A Basenji has short, fine fur. Their most recognizable color is perhaps chestnut red, but they also occur in pure black, tricolor (pure black and chestnut red), and brindle—that is, black stripes on a background of chestnut red.No matter what color the coat is, a Basenji will have white on the feet, chest, and tip of the tail. Sometimes the legs and collar will also be white.  Aside from the Basenji’s erect ears and wrinkled forehead, its tightly curled tail is perhaps its most notable characteristic. Curling back over the dog’s rump, the tail starts thick at its base and tapers into a thinner point.The tightness of the tail’s curl depends on the Basenji’s current mood and excitement level. The more stimulated and buoyant the dog is, the more tightly curled the tail will be.  If you're having trouble deciding whether or not a dog is a Basenji, ask a local expert to help. A veterinarian should be able to check for distinguishing characteristics, or you could visit a local dog club where they might have an expert who can identify this particular breed.  The larynx of the Basenji is shaped differently from most other dogs, meaning that the Basenji doesn’t make the same barking sound that other dogs do. It’s largely silent, making it a great dog for people who have small children or live in apartment buildings.When the Basenji does make a noise, it does so in a whining cry, howl, drawn-out yodel, or short, isolated “fox bark.”, Most Basenji owners remark that Basenji’s behavior more closely resembles that of cats than that of a typical dog. Stubborn, independent, and reserved, it likes to play, but it is unlikely to be a social butterfly in the dog park or with your visiting friends.Like a cat, most Basenjis will form a close bond with only one or two members of the household.  Some owners report that Basenjis bond better with dogs of other breeds than they do with dogs of their own breed., Unlike many dog breeds, the Basenji is a fastidious self-groomer and pays particular attention to its paws. Such scrupulousness means that it rarely requires human-assisted bathing and emits minimal odor.In addition to their curiously feline grooming habits, look for little to no shedding., Perhaps one of the most notable behavioral characteristics of the Basenji is its curiosity, craftiness, and destructiveness when left alone. Many Basenji owners report having to keep all cabinets and garbage receptacles tightly locked and countertops kept clean, as their dogs can get into practically anything when left to their own devices.Basenjis will devour any accessible edibles or household products, and they also love to shred paper products, such as tissues, toilet paper, and paper towels.  While Basenjis make great household pets, they aren’t the easiest dogs to train. Their independent natures and ancient instincts make them less submissive than other breeds, so an owner will have to be firm and consistent when handling them.Due to their stubbornness and independence, a Basenji responds best to positive reinforcement. When training their dogs, Basenji owners report best results when rewarding positive behavior with treats rather than scolding or jerking the leash when it does something wrong., Due to their long histories as hunting dogs, Basenjis love to chase anything and everything, including other dogs, squirrels, cats, and small children. Basenjis can still coexist with cats or other dogs, but these other pets will have to either get used to being pursued or learn not to run away from the chase-happy Basenji.A Basenji should not be trusted off the leash in the way that some obedient, low-key breeds can. Likely to bolt the minute it spots a dashing squirrel or dog, it’s particularly vulnerable to getting hit by cars and getting lost.  ","look for a wrinkled forehead. check that both ears are large and erect. measure and weigh the dog. inspect the dog's coat. look for a curled tail. check with an expert. listen to what noises the dog makes. observe the dog’s social demeanor. look for cat-like grooming behavior. expect destructive, inquisitive behavior when left alone. observe the dog’s obedience. look for chasing and hunting behaviors.

"Mobility is the range of uninhibited motion around a joint or joint system that's not impeded by tendons, muscles, and ligaments. Stability is the ability to maintain control of a joint in a particular movement or position. Possessing good joint mobility and stability in tandem will reduce the likelihood of injuring your joints, which you will need for bench pressing (and many other things)., Passive mobility refers to to being able to get into a position with the help of outside influence, and active mobility refers to being able to get there yourself. If you need a trainer, friend, or even a piece of equipment to assist you, that's passive mobility.It is okay to get into a position using passive mobility, but the goal is to eventually turn passive mobility into active ability through repetition.  Start in a position lying on one side with your legs curled as though you are sitting on a chair. Extend both arms in the same direction as your knees are pointed. With the top arm, raise it in a slow, circular motion over your head until it has reached the other opposite side and extends at a 180 degree angle from your bottom arm. Then, bring it directly from that position back to its original position, this time straight over your torso instead of making the circular motion, until your hands are touching again.Do multiple repetitions of this for each arm until your muscles start to feel looser.  Bring one arm all the way over to the other side across your chest. Use the opposite arm to press against it right above the elbow. This primarily assists the deltoids (the muscles around your shoulders).Hold this position for at least 10 to 15 seconds each time you do it, depending on how loose or tight your body feels.  Make sure you do this exercise for both arms.  Stretch your arms directly in front of you and then with a sweeping motion, move them both out to their respective sides and all the way behind you. Lock your thumbs so that both arms will be evenly and identically elevated. With your thumbs still hooked behind your back, raise your arms to be as level with your shoulder blades as possible.Hold this position for at least 10 to 15 seconds depending on how loose or tight your body feels.  When you increase your range of motion, you're adding additional ranges that you have never trained your joints for. If you try to lift weights as you did before in these new ranges, you may hurt yourself.Knock your weights down and gradually work your way back up. The process will occur much faster in the newly freed areas than it did for your initial training.  Although getting your heart rate and general body temperature up with cardio is an important part of any warm up, you want to also target specific areas of your body that will be performing the most. This will more effectively prepare you for the tasks to come, which should help you to have a better performance and prevent injury from occurring.These activities will help activate your nervous system, increase your core body temperature, and further loosen sticking joints.  Start in a basic pushup position: ideally, your weight should be supported by just your hands and toes and your face and body should only be an inch or so from the floor (not touching, but not too far away). Using your arms, push your body up as though you were doing a pushup, but continue to push further, pushing until your buttocks moves backward into what is often referred to as 'downward dog' in yoga. Ideally both your hands and feet should be flat on the floor or as close to it as you can manage.Hold the position for a second before returning to the upward pushup position, then return to the downward push up position.This activity promotes scapular (shoulder) movement and loosens the shoulders. It's also helpful for the thoracic spine.Repeat this exercise 8-10 times.  Stand facing a wall, about 2-3 inches from the surface, and pinch your shoulder blades together. Brace your forearms against the wall and slide them up and in a v shape. You want to go as high as possible, and then bring your hands away from the wall toward yourself while still keeping your shoulder blades depressed (that is, don't shrug). Return to the starting position and repeat 8-10 times.Like the yoga push up, this exercise targets the shoulder and spine again, but it also activates the 'serratus anterior muscle,' which is a muscle that goes from the ribs at the sides of your chest to meet the scapula (shoulder blades)., Although some people say you need to have a partner for this exercise, you can use a wall to bounce a medicine ball off of instead. Stand perpendicular to a wall or a partner with one leg pointed to a 90 degree angle and the other in front at a 45 degree angle. Holding a medicine ball level to your pecs, pivot with your hips (moving your feet to go with the motion) to bring your upper body face to face with the wall or your partner. Using the momentum provided by your upper body, throw the ball, and catch it when it bounces or is tossed back to you.After catching the medicine ball, return to your original position and repeat this action 8-10 times.  You do not want to stand very far from the wall or your partner; the point is not to throw the ball a great distance but to be able to throw and catch it in quick succession to loosen your body and raise your body's core temperature.  A general pre-workout warm up includes activities like stretching and cardio or aerobic activities. However, a pre-exercise warm up is just as important for lifting and should be used in combination with your pre-workout warm up. Even if you know you can bench press 200 lbs, it's better for you to gradually increase your weights to 200 lbs instead of doing 200 straight away.Once you get to your real work sets (that is, the actual exercise you want to do) that's when you should start off with your heaviest weight and then reduce.  Because different warm ups have different intentions they must also have different goals to achieve those purposes. In the case of the pre-exercise warm up sets, you want to continue to prepare the target muscles, joints, and nervous system, but now you also need to begin to prepare yourself mentally for actually lifting weights and accomplish all of that without exhausting yourself.This means you should now move to working with weights, ideally the bench press if it's available.  Starting with smaller weights, work your way up to the actual working weight you have in mind for your exercise. However, as the amount of weight you use goes up, the number of reps you do should go down. An example warm-up sequence might look like this:Begin with 1 very light set with light dumbbells. Do 10-15 reps at this weight.  Do 8 reps at 55-60% of your target exercise weight. For example, if your target weight is 100 lbs, you would use 55-60 lbs for this set.  Do 5 reps at 70-75% of your target exercise weight. Using the example from before, this would be 70-75 lbs.  Do 3 reps at 80-85% of your target exercise weight. Now you'd be at 80-85 lbs.  Do just 1 rep using 90-95% of your target exercise weight. Concluding with the example, this would mean 90-95 lbs.  If you do not have a pair of dumbbells handy, you can use just the bench press bar by itself for your first warm up set., Although you might think you can just go from one set to the other in order to get to your main focus, it is important to take a short rest between sets since you are increasing weights. This gives you a chance to breath normally, recover strength before beginning the next part of the sequence, change your weights, and even get a drink of water.Rest 45-60 seconds between every warm up set.  You will want to make sure that while you are doing these exercises that you are maintaining the same good form that you use during your regular bench pressing. That means that when using the bench press your feet should be on the ground and your upper back and butt are both in contact with the bench. Make sure that when you bring the bar down, it is coming down over your chest (pecs) and not your neck or head., Someone who is planning to bench press more weight is going to need a longer pre-exercise warm up. The reason for this is that there is simply a greater amount to work up to. So, if you plan to bench press 250 lbs and your friend is only bench pressing 50, you should be doing more sets to work your way up than your friend., If you're a beginner to weight lifting, you will not need to do as many reps as someone who is more advanced. That's because beginners are generally weaker than their more advanced counterparts. To compensate for this, you might be able to eliminate sets 4 and 5 from your routine because they will be less important until later on.There is no set period of time or strength level to determine if you are a beginner or advanced weight lifter, and you shouldn't feel pressured to move to something heavier faster. Decide based on the progress that you're making: if you plateau on your beginner routine for a sustained period of time, that is when you should consider moving up to a more advanced routine.  ","understand the importance of joint mobility and stability. understanding active vs passive mobility. do side-lying windmills. do arm cross-over stretches. do double arm behind the back stretches. compensate your lifting habits accordingly. understand why you do targetted warm ups. do yoga push ups. do forearm wall-slides at a 135 degree angle. do chest passes with a medicine ball. know the difference between a pre-exercise and pre-workout warm up. understand the goals of warm up sets. design your warm up sets to avoid fatigue. rest between sets. maintain good form. account for your strength level. account for your experience level.

"Canker sores can be caused by a variety of factors. If you have several cankers or you get them repeatedly, consider:  Brushing your teeth more gently. Brush your teeth gently with a soft-bristled toothbrush. Floss daily.  Changing your toothpaste. Toothpastes or mouthwashes that contain sodium lauryl sulfate can cause canker sores and continue to aggravate them. Try substituting natural toothpaste into your regimen.  Relaxing. Many people get canker sores during times of intense emotional stress. Like acne and eczema, canker sores can be exacerbated by stressors.;  , Diet can have a significant effect — beneficial and detrimental — on canker sores.  Avoid spicy or acidic foods, which can irritate sores further. Peppers and sodas should be shunned. Fruits and vegetables such as lemons, oranges, pineapples, apples, figs, tomatoes, and strawberries may also cause canker sores.Get more B12, zinc, iron, and folic acid.Take a vitamin supplement, or multiple supplements, that contain these every morning.  Canker sores often appear after cuts and lesions break open the skin inside the mouth.  If you have braces or other orthodontics, eliminate areas that protrude into the skin. Talk to your orthodontist about eliminating sharp corners or wires that may cut into the skin. Ask for orally-safe wax that can be applied to orthodontics to help ward off cuts and other injuries.  Ill-fitting dentures may also cause canker sores.Talk to your dentist about options concerning your dentures.  Simple canker sores, which are common and appear three or four times a year and last up to a week, are likely not caused by underlying health problems. If the lesions last longer or recur often, they may not be canker sores, and may be due to underlying health problems.Individuals with compromised immune systems may be at higher risk for canker sores.  Individuals with gastrointestinal tract diseases, such as Celiac disease and Crohn's disease, may also be at higher risk for complex canker sores.  Mix a few pinches of salt in a glass of warm water. Swish around inside your mouth and spit out, repeating two or three times a day.  An alternative to this is baking soda. Mix one teaspoon baking soda with several ounces of warm water. Swish and spit out.  Alternatively, create a paste with equal parts baking soda and water. Dab the paste over the canker sore with a Q-tip and let dry.  Salt water and baking soda both help the mouth heal itself by reducing the acidity and bacteria in the mouth.  Pour a little bit of it into a plastic soda cap and dilute with an equal amount of water.  Dip the Q-tip into the peroxide solution and dab it only on the canker sore.  Turn the Q-tip around and repeat.  Empty the cap and rinse it with water.  Take care not to swallow any of the hydrogen peroxide if possible.  Hydrogen peroxide is an antiseptic that will reduce the amount of bacteria in your mouth and help the canker sore heal.  The canker sore should go away in about 2-3 days if you do it twice a day.  Dab it on active spots a few times a day. The antacid effect of milk of magnesia neutralizes the acidic environment, changing the pH, and making it less supportive of the bacteria in the mouth that aggravate the canker sore., Combine one part diphenhydramine (sold as Benadryl) with 1 part antacid, such as Maalox or Kaopectate. Swish around your mouth and spit out.  Regular old mouthwash does work, although there are different OTC mouthwash solutions that are specifically targeted to help treat canker sores. They include:  Diphenhydramine suspension washes (Benadryl Allergy liquid and others). These types of washes generally treat the pain of the canker sore. The mouthwash solution should not be swallowed., You can take over-the-counter painkillers, or apply benzocaine gels (such as Anbesol and Orajel) directly onto active sores.  Suck on ice chips. Try to hold them over the sores, allowing them to melt over the area. Ice should help numb the pain and reduce inflammation.  Three of these remedies are designed to change the pH in your mouth. The theory here is that changing the pH will make your mouth less hospitable to the bacteria that are causing the canker sore:  Eat yogurt daily.  Apply a wet black teabag to the ulcer.  Squeeze the oil of a Vitamin E capsule onto the sore, repeating several times per day.  Squeeze the lemon with a lemon squeezer or just squeeze is on the ulcer straight away.  If you squeezed the lemon with a lemon squeezer, wash your hands, put your finger in the juice then dab it on your ulcer.  Repeat it before breakfast, after breakfast, before lunch, after lunch, before tea, after tea, before dinner, after dinner and right before you sleep.  Leave it on for 1-5 minutes. Then rinse off, if needed.  If you're constantly battling canker sores and none of the above fixes are working, perhaps there's an underlying issue.For some conditions, canker sores are an early and important sign that something else is wrong.  Consider investigating whether you have Celiac Disease, Crohn's Disease, or inflammatory bowel disease. All three are autoimmune conditions that can cause frequent mouth sores.  You might also ask the doctor if it's possible you have Helicobacter pylori, more commonly known as H. pylori, which can cause stomach ulcers.  If you've ruled out gastrointestinal disease, consider visiting an immunologist. There are a few rare immune conditions that can manifest as persistent mouth sores.  You have two options for prescription mouth rinses:  Dexamethasone, a steroid mouth rinse that should reduce pain and inflammation. Dexamethasone should reduce the number of recurrences, but is generally reserved for more severe cases.Tetracycline, an antibiotic used for more extreme cases. Your sores will heal quickly, but your mouth will be susceptible to a fungal condition called thrush. Thrush is an infection of yeast fungus in the mucous membranes of the mouth.  Topical ointments such as benzocaine (Anbesol), amlexanox (Aphthasol) and fluocinonide (Lidex, Vanos) may relieve pain and speed healing if applied as soon as canker sores appear.Doctors usually suggest treating sores with ointments 2-4 times during the day.  Other oral medication not specifically intended to treat canker sores may be helpful in treating canker sores. Cimetidine (Tagamet) and colchicine, gout medicines, are sometimes effective in treating canker sores.Steroidal oral medications are generally used as a last resort, only when canker sores don't respond to other medications. Doctors still don't know what exactly causes canker sores., Cauterizing — or burning the surface tissue — sores can keep open sores from getting bigger, and the burn will eventually heal over. Most cauterizations are performed with chemical solutions, such as silver nitrate.  ","try to stop the cause. pay attention to your diet. try not to irritate the inside of your mouth if at all possible. treat other medical conditions that may cause or make canker sores worse. use a salt or baking soda rinse. use a 3% hydrogen peroxide solution. use milk of magnesia. use an antihistamine/antacid mix. use otc mouthwash. treat the pain (optional). try other miscellaneous remedies. use a lemon. visit a specialist if you get frequent sores. schedule an appointment with a gastroenterologist. schedule an appointment with an immunologist. request a prescription mouth rinse. request topical gels and ointments. request cauterization.

"There are many ways you can leave assets to the NRDC using estate planning. You should meet with an estate planning attorney to fully understand the tax consequences of making a gift to the Natural Resources Defense Council.  You can get a referral to an estate planning attorney by contacting your local or state bar association, which you can find here: http://shop.americanbar.org/ebus/ABAGroups/DivisionforBarServices/BarAssociationDirectories/StateLocalBarAssociations.aspx.  Also see Select an Estate Planning Attorney for more information.  You can help support the NRDC by leaving them property or cash in your retirement instruments. Consider the following ways you can leave assets:Leave assets in a will or living trust. You remain in control of the assets during your lifetime. At death, the assets pass to the NRDC to use. You can also change your mind before you die and remove the gift from your will/living trust.Name the NRDC as a beneficiary to your retirement plan, such as your IRA, 401(k) or other qualified plan. You can continue to make withdrawals during your lifetime. You will need to contact your plan administrator and then tell the NRDC.Donate a life insurance policy. If you have a paid-up life insurance policy, you can transfer ownership to the NRDC.Leave stock and other appreciated assets. You can transfer stocks, bonds, or mutual fund shares to the NRDC, which then sells them and uses the money for its programs. You must have owned the assets for at least a year. You receive a tax deduction in return., It’s possible to donate assets to the NRDC and receive income in return. You should talk about the following options with your estate attorney:Purchase a charitable gift annuity. In exchange for transferring cash or securities to the NRDC, you get paid income for life. The minimum gift must be $10,000 and you should be at least 60 years old. After all beneficiaries die, the NRDC keeps the balance of the assets.If you are under 60, then you can begin funding an annuity early with a deferred gift annuity (provided you are at least 40). When you turn 60, you can begin drawing the annuity.Contribute assets to a pooled income fund. In return, you receive income for life. This is like a charitable gift annuity, and your initial minimum gift should be $10,000.Create charitable trusts. You can transfer cash, securities, or other property into a charitable remainder trust and receive a percentage of the principal in payment. When the trust terminates, the NRDC keeps the assets. You must have at least $100,000.A charitable annuity trust is similar, though it makes annual payments in fixed amounts., Another option is to fund a trust with securities or other appreciating assets. The trust makes yearly payments to the NRDC. However, when the trust terminates, the assets pass to your heirs.The NRDC recommends a minimum gift of $1,000,000 to a charitable lead trust.  You can request additional information here http://www.legacy.vg/nrdc/articles/41.html. You may also call 212-727-4421 if you have questions.

"Kissing a guy on the cheek is a great way to touch him flirtatiously without coming on too strong. This typically happens when you greet or say goodbye to a hug, and you both lean in to give a kiss on opposite cheeks. Just make sure that you know the guy well enough and that the occasion is appropriate -- you shouldn't try this move if you're saying hello in the halls or in a class, but you can try it if you're saying hello or goodbye at the end of a party or when you're out with your friends.  When you kiss the guy on the cheek, let your lips just graze the side of his cheek. Don't give him a wet, sloppy kiss.  Make sure that he's leaning in for the kiss or cheek-to-cheek move, too.  Another way to be flirtatious is to lightly hit the guy when you're talking. You can gently hit him on his upper arm if you're both standing up, or hit him on the knee if you're both sitting down. This is a move that says, 'Oh, stop it! But really, don't...' Make sure you do this lightly and don't hit him too hard, or he'll be put off.  When you're being playful like this, it's important that the guy is reciprocating. If you're playfully hitting him from time to time, he should return the gesture.  This is another low-key but effective way to touch a guy flirtatiously. If you're sitting across from each other and he says something that makes you laugh or which was meant to elicit an 'Ew!' or 'Gross!' reaction, then you can playfully kick the top of his foot with your own. If you're feeling bold, you can playfully kick him under the table and then move your feet so that they're just touching his, daring him to move.  Playing with a guy's hair is a great way to flirt with him. This is a pretty bold move, so you shouldn't over use it and find a good reason to do it. For example, if the guy just got a haircut, you can gently squeeze his hair to tease him. If his hair looks a little messy, you can playfully try to fix it, using it as an excuse to touch him. Just make sure he likes it -- it's a pretty intimate gesture, and not every guy likes to have his hair touched.  If you and the guy are sitting across from each other, lean in until your knees are almost touching. Then, if he moves closer, or if you're just feeling bold, have the tops of your knees touch, or move your knees so that one is on the outside of his legs and one is between them, so you move closer together. Lean your body toward him to make this happen.  If you really want to get flirty, wait for the time when the guy has an eyelash or even a bit of food on his cheek. Then, lean over and gently brush it off him, taking care to make light contact with his skin. Linger just enough to get flirty, and move closer to him so he feels you getting more intimate.  Guys usually like being touched on the cheek because it is soft and comfortable.  Once you've gotten more intimate, you can reach your hand over to hold the guy's hand when you're standing up. You can hold hands while you're walking, or while you're sitting down and talking or watching a movie. If you're sitting across from each other, you can hold hands under the table or with your hands over the table. Give the guy's hand a gentle squeeze from time to time to keep the flirtatious mood going.  Though holding a guy's hand is a great way to flirt with him, you should avoid this move unless you're already 'together' somewhat -- holding hands in public is a declaration that you're an item, and not all guys may like that.  Also, a lot of guys just don't like to have their hands held, period, whether you're alone or in public, so be cautious when you try this form of affection.  If you want to be flirtatious with the guy, you can place one hand on his chest as you're talking and moving closer to him. This is especially effective if he's standing with his back to a wall or if you're in a small, enclosed space.  ","kiss the guy on the cheek. give him a playful smack. kick him under the table. play with his hair. touch his knees with yours. gently brush his cheeks. hold the guy's hand. touch his chest. "
"Find an extra one lying around the house, ask a friend or relative if they have one, or buy one.  If you need to ask your parents to buy you a box, say you need it for storage or a school project.  Another thing you can do is give a friend some money and ask them to buy a box. Or if you have an older sibling with a car, take advantage of that.;  , Make sure you don't exceed that.  Watch the mailman for a few days and record the time s/he comes. Then wait outside and when s/he comes, run over and give the package to him/her personally so your parents don't find it if they need to mail a letter.  If they mailman comes while you are at school, give the package to him/her on a Saturday.  Some stores will mail packages for you, but make sure you know if they do ahead of time. Print a map and circle the post office, your home, and your school.  Are you going to bike to the post office when your parents are napping? Lie and say you're meeting up with a friend? Take a trip to the post office after school?  If you're going to leave the house when your parents think you're home, then you're sneaking out. This is an extremely dangerous thing to do in the daytime and not the best choice. You should only do it if it's the only choice.  If you lie and say you're going to meet up with a friend, you should either make sure your friend in with the plan (so if they're questioned about your 'day out,' they'll have a good story ready) or actually meet up with a friend. That way you won't be caught in a lie.  You don't want to have a friend's mom drop you off at the post office five miles away, then realize you're stuck and have to call your parents.

Always assume the worst so you'll be prepared  Bring money for a cab in case your friend realizes she can't take you to the post office after all or you hurt your ankle while walking back from the post office or your bike gets a flat tire. Have the cab drop you off about a block away from home.  Think about the amount of time it will take to get to the post office, mail the package, and get back, then add another fifteen minutes for safety in case you your friend needs to stop for gas or the lines at the post office are longer than expected.  Remember it will cost money to mail a package.  Practice it several times to make it sound believable.  Don't stutter a lot, don't say you might be late from school that day, and don't ask if they are going to go to the post office that day.  Keep in mind that lugging a package that size around will be very inconvenient and a lot harder to hide from your parents.  You don't want your parents finding that.  ","before you do anything, you need to get a box to mail your item in. padded envelopes can be put in the mailbox, but there is a size and weight limit. find out where the nearest post office is. decide where you're going to mail the package from. consider your methods of transportation and how you're going to get home. come up with a good story to tell little siblings who are going through the tattletale phase, strangers who ask where your parents are, or your angry parents who found out you took a detour after school. on the big day, act normal. hide your package in your backpack, or if it's really big, get it out of the house when your parents aren't around and hide it somewhere. after mailing the package, either destroy the receipt or throw it out somewhere that isn't at home. get home as quickly as possible and give yourself a pat on the back!

"Often anxiety begins when a person is engaging in cognitive distortions, or distorted and unhelpful ways of thinking. Distorted thoughts are thinking errors that start in your subconscious mind and make you feel anxious. Once you realize that you are engaging in a thinking error, then it’s much easier to change your thinking pattern. Here are four unhelpful thinking errors that often make anxiety worse:Fortune telling is when you try to predict the future without any real evidence to support your prediction. Typically you’re assuming the worst. For example, you may think, “I know that everyone is going to laugh at me.” When you find yourself doing this, ask yourself for the evidence.  Personalizing is when you believe, without any evidence, that people are negatively focused on you. For example, if you see someone talking to another person while looking in your direction, you may assume, “That person is talking about my outfit.”  Mind reading is when you assume that you know what other people are thinking. For example, you may think, “She thinks I’m stupid” when you have no idea what she is really thinking.  Catastrophizing is basically when you blow things out of proportion or “make a mountain out of a molehill.” You turn everything into a catastrophe when you use this thinking pattern. For example, if your friend forgets to compliment you on your performance, you might automatically think, “Oh my goodness. I did awful. Everyone probably thinks I’m completely incompetent.”;  , When you think that you may be engaging in cognitive distortions, take a minute to determine if your thoughts are real or distorted. You can do this by asking yourself for the evidence. Say to yourself, 'What real evidence do I have that supports this thought?' When you take this approach, it helps you identify the thinking error and allows you to think more helpful and realistic thoughts. Here are examples of asking for the evidence based on the cognitive distortions above:  'What actual evidence do I have that everyone will laugh at me during my presentation?'  'How do I know that she is really talking about my outfit and not about something else?'  'What actual evidence do I have that she really thinks I'm stupid?'  'What evidence do I have that the audience thought that I was incompetent?'  , Negative automatic thoughts are usually at the foundation of your anxiety.They are quick flashes of thought that enter your consciousness without you really being aware of them. Unfortunately they have often been reinforced since early childhood so you no longer even realize that they are present. They also usually contribute to your thinking errors.  For example, if every time you stood up in class in elementary school to speak, a peer laughed at you, you may have internalized that people laugh at you when you speak. Your automatic thought as an adult might now be, “If I speak in public, I will be embarrassed because people will laugh at me.”  When you find yourself feeling anxious, reflect on your thoughts. Ask yourself, “Why am I feeling anxious?” Take note of your response and then dig deeper by asking yourself, “What else?” For example, if you ask yourself why you are feeling anxious, you may think, “I don’t want to speak in public.” If you dig a little deeper by asking, “What else?” you may discover that the real negative thought is “I’m afraid people will laugh at me.”  , Once you understand the negative thoughts that are causing you to feel anxious, now it’s time to replace them with more helpful thoughts. Ask yourself questions that will help you identify a healthier opposite thought.Using the same example from above about public speaking, here are some questions that you could ask yourself:  Do people ALWAYS laugh at me when I speak?  When was the last time someone laughed at me when I said something?  Even if someone does laugh, is that the end of the world?  A healthier alternative thought could be “I am going to speak to the best of my ability. The people who need the information will hear it, even if the delivery is not perfect. It doesn't have to be perfect in order for me to do a good job.”  , Try to avoid listening to your internal chatter by focusing on the external world. Observe what people are doing and saying. Try to really tune into conversations so that you aren’t preoccupied with your thoughts or uneasy bodily sensations.  ","assess the cognitive distortion. ask yourself for the evidence. identify your negative automatic thoughts. challenge and replace the negative thought. focus on your surroundings. "
"Are you ready to be the owner of a land turtle? They live a long time, can grow quite large, are not great pets for young children, and their care and feeding can be quite expensive (special lights, enclosures, vet visits). Because of their longevity, you also need to realize that your tortoise, if well cared for, can easily outlive you. , Turtles are omnivores and require some time in the water. Tortoises are herbivores and are land-based. Both require appropriate outdoor and indoor environments and need good and attentive care if they are to thrive. Land turtles may have the reputation as an “easy” pet, but they actually require quite a bit of work. , Observe the pets, and look at photos of some possibilities. Which ones do you like? Which ones do long-time turtle keepers recommend? If it’s your first turtle, you also should ask which ones are easiest to care for and best for first-time owners.  Land turtles, when cared for properly, need to be outside at least part of the time. Choose a turtle that can thrive where you live. This means if you live in a humid place, choose a turtle that likes those conditions. Get a turtle that thrives in arid places if you live in the desert. This will make it much easier to care for your turtle because you won’t have to create a new outdoor environment for the turtle and keep it regulated.  This is essential if you might move, changing the environment to which the turtle is exposed. Trying to create a new outdoor-like environment for a humidity-loving turtle in a snowy climate can get very difficult and expensive. , Just as choosing a turtle that thrives in your outdoor environment makes caring for it much easier, so too does choosing a turtle native to your country and region. Not all areas have native land turtles, but ask around for the turtles most likely to thrive in your area.  Turtles from elsewhere are often taken from the wild, leading to the depletion of native turtle and tortoise populations around the world. For the health of the environment and native turtles, domestically-bred turtles or rescued turtles are the best choice., It needs to be watertight. There are many possible ways to make an enclosure, but it needs to be quite large, even for small turtles -- many sources say that you can start in a large and deep plastic tub, but will need to make much larger enclosures as your turtle grows. You can make a dedicated turtle table out of wood, repurpose an old bookshelf with the shelves removed, or use a plastic kiddie pool. Your ultimate choice will depend on the species of land turtle. , Turtles have specific needs, and the exact specifications will vary depending on the turtle you choose. Make sure you have everything in place before you get your turtle. You can’t just get the different parts together as you go -- the turtles will need everything immediately.  Turtles will need substrate, which allows them to dig, and can also help in waste disposal. It’s vital that you choose a good-quality and appropriate substrate, because they will have so much contact with it. , Turtles need lights that provide UV-B so that they get Vitamin B. Keep in mind you’ll need to purchase new light bulbs every 6 months to a year because they lose their ability to produce UV-B.. , Different turtles need different levels of humidity, so check the needs of your species. It could be low, middle, or high, depending on the native environment of your turtle. Most will need some kind of misting on their substrate. , You might have to buy a heat lamp for the proper environment for your turtle or tortoise. Particularly if you have a turtle that is not native to your area, heat might prove to be the most essential element for your land turtle. , Box turtles and tortoises should have some kind of water in their structures. Again, it will depend on the species, but all will need a shallow water dish or bowl to soak in (and possibly defecate into). , This is an essential part of the way turtles interact with their environment. It could be as simple as a small plastic box or bowl with a hole cut in the side. , This will be just as important for many land turtle species as the indoor enclosure. Make sure yours is large and safe. Turtles need to be protected from predators and from escape. Your enclosure should be tall enough they cannot escape over it, and have barriers under the dirt so they can’t burrow under. A roof for the enclosure is also typically a necessity. , Do not just use the dirt you have in your backyard -- it’s not appropriate for land turtles. Be advised that grass, particularly wet grass, is also bad for land turtles. It can cause painful abrasions. , Since your turtle will be spending a lot of time outdoors, planting food for them makes a lot of sense. You won’t have to look for food for them, and they can choose to eat when they want to. , Don’t just have a flat and boring outdoor enclosure. Create little hills they can climb, different areas to explore, and a variety of environments within the enclosure. , Too much of some nutrients like calcium or protein can severely stunt or even kill your land turtle. Keep in mind that tortoises are herbivores, while box turtles are omnivores. You should give box turtles slugs, snails, crickets and other animal matter twice a week. The rest of the time they will eat fruits like melon, berries, and tomatoes. Greens are also a great addition to a turtle’s diet. Tortoises do not eat any animal matter, but their diets are quite varied. Please do the research to determine what diet is best for your particular species of tortoise. , Hibernation is a contested issue among turtle owners. Talk to your veterinarian to see if your land turtle should be hibernating. Keep in mind that turtles who do not have enough fat reserves can easily die if they are in hibernation. Hibernation is also not recommended for turtles who might be at all medically compromised. Some turtle experts caution against hibernation at all. If you do choose to hibernate your land turtle, prepare your turtle habitat carefully. You might even need to build a special hibernation box, depending on the species. It needs to be in a place that is temperature-regulated and will not flood. Stop feeding your land turtle two weeks before planned hibernation, and start lowering the temperature in the habitat slightly. Hibernation can last from 3-5 months. Be sure to check the temperature requirements for your particular type of land turtle. , Land turtles should not be in homes that have dogs (possible predators of turtles). Keep in mind that infants and children are also not ideal companions for turtles. Many experts recommend that only children over 12 years old have contact with land turtles. Most small turtles are carriers of salmonella, an infection that can possibly be fatal to infants, the elderly, and the medically fragile. Even if your turtle is not in the “small turtle” category, there is still a risk of the turtle passing on infections to children. , The majority of turtles carry parasites and possibly other infections, some of which can be dangerous to humans. Depending on where you got your turtle from, it might be at risk for malnourishment and dehydration. With turtles, it can be difficult for you to tell if they are having problems, so choose a good exotic animal veterinarian. , Most land turtles will grow a lot as they grow older. This doesn't means you need to be attuned to the ways you will need to change their living environments, both inside and outside, and their feeding and possible hibernation. Turtles need 3 square feet of floor space for each 8 inches of turtle length. For tortoises, it’s even more -- a minimum of 3 square yards of floor space for each 12 inches of length.  ","investigate your choices. decide if you want a turtle or tortoise. visit turtle breeders and talk to other turtle owners online. keep in mind the climate where you live. choose smaller land turtles. look for native land turtles. buy a turtle from a breeder or rescue organization. create the indoor enclosure for your turtle. add elements to the indoor structure. purchase the appropriate dirt product for the kind of turtle you have. buy special lights for your land turtle. add humidity based on your type of land turtle. keep your land turtle at the appropriate temperature for their species. include water. create a place for your turtle to hide. create the outdoor enclosure for your turtle. make sure you use substrate as the base of the enclosure. include plants that the land turtles like to eat. create places for them to hide and explore -- rocks, wood, etc. feed your tortoise or box turtle an appropriate diet. consider whether you want your land turtle to hibernate. create a healthy environment for your turtle and your family. make regular trips to veterinarian with your land turtle. do not change your pet’s environment as he or she grows.

"Nail trimming is another important task. Use guillotine-type nail clippers to trim each nail to just above the quick (the thin vein in each nail) every one to two months. Consider trimming the nails just after a bath, when your Shih Tzu’s nails will be softened by the water.Keep some styptic powder close by when you trim the nails. If you cut the quick and the nail starts bleeding, put a dab of the powder on trimmed section of the nail., Shih Tzu are very prone to dental disease, which can create a lot of pain and discomfort in the mouth. Brushing your Shih Tzu’s teeth once or twice a week will help prevent dental disease.Use dog-specific toothpaste and a dog-safe toothbrush to clean the teeth.If your Shih Tzu won’t stay still enough for you to brush its teeth, ask your vet or a professional groomer to do the teeth cleaning.  When you brush the teeth, look for swelling or redness of the gums.This could indicate dental disease.  After your Shih Tzu poops, some of the feces may get stuck in the hair around the bottom. Not only would this be smelly, but a buildup of feces could become very uncomfortable for your Shih Tzu. Once or twice a month, wipe around your Shih Tzu’s bottom with a warm, damp cloth to remove the feces.

"You may have difficulty fighting the urge to procrastinate, but keep in mind that feedback and revisions can sometimes take up to a week. Having a rough version of your report at the ready a month in advance can save you from unnecessary stress and from having to turn in unpolished work.  You may have perform supplemental experiments/simulations, or repeat your initial experience after receiving your first round of feedback.  Feedback should go through the following stages ideally:  (a) Self-review and revision  (b) Peer review and constructive feedback  (c) Advisor/instructor review and feedback  ;  , The goal of your experiment or the goal of proving or disproving certain hypotheses are essentially unimportant when you are writing a lab report. The data contained in it could be anything, and you may very well have to write lab reports in the future that seem silly or unnecessary. The goal of your lab report is to be read and evaluated by another person, like your instructor.It can help to remind yourself of this goal at the beginning of every section before you start writing.  When you finish a section of your report, read it through carefully and at the end of it, ask yourself: was that easy to read and understand? Did I succeed in my goal?  , The narrowest purpose of your lab report is to enable your seniors, advisors, and/or an evaluation committee to confirm your ability to consistently and clearly produce a report.But once you start devising and performing labs of your own, its quite possible that your peers or juniors will utilize it as a resource.  If you believe your paper might be of use to researchers in another discipline, like a social science, you may want to include definitions or explanations for the more technical jargon used in your paper.  Take a piece of scrap paper and pencil and list the necessary sections of your lab report in order. Under each section, jot a few sentences that summarize what must be covered in that section.  Due to the fact that different instructors have different preferences, you should check your lab report handout or course syllabus to verify expectations for the order and content of your report.Most lab reports are organized, first to last: problem, hypothesis, materials, procedure, data, and conclusion.  Technical aspects of your paper might require significant explanation. This may necessitate the use of subsections so that you can appropriately delve into and explain those nuanced aspects of your lab problem.  The organization of the body of your lab report will be specific to your problem/experiment.  You may also have a separate section for the statement of your design methodology, experimental methodology, or proving subsidiary/intermediary theorems in your report.  The idea behind this style is that you should begin with the most important elements (the 'head' points) and refine each of those all the way to the basic level.This can be divided into roughly three stages:  The section-level outline  The subsection-level outline  The paragraph-level outline  , This will give you a better idea of how to get from a blank page to a finished report.Begin with each of your section headings, leaving plenty of space between headings for subsection and paragraph-level information. Avoid being too wordy at this stage, the goal of your outline is to capture the flow and form of your report.  Bullet points are invaluable when you reach the paragraph level of your report. These will allow you to note important terms, phrases, and data that will need to be integrated with the text of your report.  Take special note, at the paragraph level, of important symbols, protocols, algorithms, and jargon.  Use a unique bullet to indicate where an image must be integrated into your report.  You might also consider using using simple figures as a way of cutting down unnecessary wordiness.  Highlighters can help you color code and coordinate sections of your outline with supplemental papers, like research, print-outs, and hand-outs. A colorful sticky note, on the other hand, can alert you to something you've forgotten or have yet to do, like making a graph from your data.  These two items are the most visible parts of your lab report, and will therefore receive the most attention.A bland title or incomprehensible abstract can limit the impact your report has with your peers.  The title of your report should reflect what you have done and bring out any eye-catching factor of your work.  The abstract should be concise, generally about 2 paragraphs or about 200 words in length., Your abstract should contain the essence of your report. This can generally be conveyed by the following points, in varying amounts of detail, as is appropriate for your case:  (a) Main motivation  (b) Main design point  (c) Essential differences from previous work  (d) Methodology  (e) Noteworthy results, if any  , Nearly all reports should start with an introduction section. After the title and abstract, it is generally accepted that the introduction and conclusion are the second most widely read part of any given report. This section should answer the following questions:  What is the setting of the problem? This is, in other words, the background. In some cases, this may be implicit, and in some cases, this question may be merged with the motivation of your paper.  What is the problem you are trying to solve? This is also known as the problem statement of your report.  Why is your problem important? This is the motivation behind your report. In some cases, it may be implicit in the background, or even the problem statement.  Is the problem still unsolved? The constitutes the statement of past/related work, and should be conveyed succinctly., Since the introduction of your report is little more than a short summary of your lab in words, your outline can be an excellent guide your writing here. In many cases, the rest of your report will have the same, or a similar, flow.Each section of the body of your report can be thought of as an in-depth look at the points mentioned in the introduction.  To prevent confusion and create a strong logical chain throughout your report, you should, if applicable to your situation, also consider answering the questions:  Why is your problem difficult to solve?  How have you solved the problem?  What are the conditions under which your solution is applicable?  What are the main results?  What is the summary of your contributions? This, in some cases, may be implicit in the body of your introduction. Sometimes it helps to state contributions explicitly.  How is the rest of your report organized?  , It is common to state that 'the reader who knows this background can skip this section' at the beginning of this section.  The key to writing this section is not overwhelming your readers with too much information.If you need to describe or explain specialty equipment or theory that is used, you should:  Describe the equipment or theory in a short paragraph.  Consider including a diagram of the apparatus for equipment.  Theoretical elements should be included in both natural and derived forms., If there have been similar experiments performed, or if you are expanding upon or applying a new approach to past research, interpreting how that research informed and directed your own will naturally highlight differences between your experiment and others. One possible placement is toward the beginning of the report, after your intro and background sections. Another idea is to place it in the end of the report, just before your conclusion. This is a matter of preference, and depends on the preferences of your instructor or, potentially, the following aspects:  A large quantity of work closely related to your work would likely be best closer to the beginning of your report. This will allow you to point out differences best.  Relevant work that is substantially different from your own is probably best toward the end of your report. However, this placement risks leaving your readers wondering about differences until the end of your report.  It is common to have this as a separate section where you explain what makes your experiment novel. Here, you must try to think of dimensions of comparison with regard to other work. For instance, you may compare your lab in terms of:  Functionality  Performance  Approach  Note: each of these comparisons can be further distinguished by:  1. Functionality  2. Metric  3. Implementation  4. Etc.  Although this may not be necessary in your particular case, many lab reports use graphics to juxtapose differences between your work and that of others. This helps to illustrate the differences between the two at a glance for your readers.  If you decide to use a chart, it is general convention that you include your own work in either the first or last column.  The results section of your report will change according to the kind of lab you have performed, its goals, implementation, and so on. In this section, you will need to lay out all data from your experiment without making subjective comments or discussing opinions. Figures and tables should be used to organize your data as clearly and succinctly as possible.All figures and tables should be titled descriptively, numbered sequentially, and include a descriptive legend for symbols, abbreviations, etc.  The columns and rows of all tables and the axes of graphs should be labeled., If your lab has yielded abundant results, the important points in that data can be missed. Your readers will stand a better chance of remembering these if you include a summary of the indispensable information in a separate sub-section at the end of your results section.  Even if your data has confirmed your hypothesis beyond your wildest expectations, the results section of your report should be objective. To ensure that your data and its purpose are both clear to your readers, you might ask the following questions:  What aspects of your system or algorithm are you trying to evaluate? Why?  What are the cases of comparison? If you have proposed an algorithm or a design, what do you compare it with?  What are the performance metrics? Why?  What are the parameters under study?  What is the experimental setup?  , This will require you to logically connect your results to existing theory and knowledge. Any improvements to technique or equipment that you may have realized over the course of your lab should also be included here.  Predictions are expected in this section, though these should be clearly identified as such.  Future experiments that might clarify your results should be suggested., If you state these explicitly, you can create trust and professional respect between you and your reader.  For labs that are data heavy or incorporate highly complex principles, you might need to use your discussion section to speak on those results independently. Your conclusion should look at your results with regard to the entire experiment., It is generally accepted in academic communities that readers focus most attention on the title, abstract, introduction, and conclusion of a lab or academic paper. In that sense, this section is quite important.  Precisely and in as few words as possible, state the main findings of your lab.  Answer the question: How has the reader become smarter, or how has the world become a better place because of your work?  , This is the final section of your lab report, and is separate from your bibliography.Your section on literature cited should only include references that appear in your written report. You should alphabetize this list by author's last name, and then format the remaining information according to the source requirements., Though it might seem tiresome to you, having to slog through the report of another at the direction of your instructor, offering feedback and comments, this is an important part of the process.It is so important, in fact, that academic papers are rarely accepted until thoroughly peer reviewed.  This is especially important if you are working with a group on a lab. Each member of the group, being a part of the lab, will likely be unable to critique the report objectively.  You might also make use of your campus writing center, if available. Here you can have a fresh set of eyes assess the quality of your report.  Though not necessary, you can help your reviewer do the best job possible by providing him with a checklist of key points. For example, if you have a tendency to use too much jargon, you might include, 'clear jargon' in your critique checklist. Other items you might want to highlight for your reviewer:  Title/abstract logical, understandable, and eye-catching?  All relevant questions answered in the introduction?  Overall structure of sections and subsections meaningful?  Differences between related/past work apparent?  Technical sections intelligible?  Figures/tables explained properly?  Use of terminology clear?  Symbols defined appropriately?  Results explained properly?  Technical holes/flaws?  , In some cases, you might have a difference of opinion from your reviewer. In other cases, your reviewer might give weak, questionable, or incorrect feedback. In still other cases, a reviewer can save you from making a critical error!Remember that your reviewer is taking time out of his day to read your report, and express your gratitude for his feedback.  It can be easy to get carried away when making critique. Reviewers may even get frustrated with the state of a report, which can lead to personal comments. This can be offensive, and defeats the purpose of the peer review process, which is to improve the report, not make enemies.Try to keep your comments as impersonal as possible. Locate specific elements that can be isolated, targeted, and improved.  While taking feedback from a peer, take the comments on their technical merit and avoid being defensive.  ","get a head start on your lab report as soon as possible. write your report with the primary goal of readability. determine your present audience, and potential future ones. outline the general structure of your lab report. break sections of your report into subsections, if necessary. familiarize yourself with the top-down approach. write your initial outline in top-down style. remember figures, tables, and graphs at the paragraph-level.you will need to weave these into the text of your report in a way that is logical and intuitive. use organizational tools, like highlighters and sticky notes. craft your title and abstract carefully. refine your abstract down to crucial information. devise your introduction. model your intro off your top-down outline. include substantiation and critical details in your intro.the intricacies of the lab experiment you are writing about in your report may not be clear to every reader. provide a background section, if necessary.in the event that vital background information needs to be expressed to your readers early in the paper, this information can be expanded into its own sub-section. write your section on materials and methods. consider a section interpreting related work. differentiate your report from past and/or related work, if necessary. use a table or graph to clearly indicate differences. state your results in your data section.. summarize your main points for data heavy results sections. define your data and its purpose impartially and clearly. interpret your data and results in the discussion section. address any other weaknesses in your discussion section.even if your natural inclination is to gloss over weak points in your lab report, this can be harmful to your credibility. add a separate conclusion section for longer reports. make your conclusion count. list all sources used in your lab report. respect the process. seek review from peers involved in different projects. write a critique checklist. accept feedback from your peers politely. critique structure, clarity, and logic, not the writer.

"State and federal laws prohibit landlords from discriminating against tenants by increasing rent only for selected tenants such as those of a certain race or those who have children.If you believe your landlord is raising your rent for a discriminatory reason, you first must determine if you are a member of a group protected by anti-discrimination laws.  Federal law prohibits landlords from discriminating against tenants on the basis of race or color, religion, sex, national origin, familial status, age, and disability or handicap. Your state's law may prohibit discrimination for other reasons as well.  In most states your landlord also cannot increase your rent in retaliation for your participation in certain protected activities, such as joining a tenant's organization, reporting health or safety code violations to the government, or successfully defending against an eviction.If your landlord increases your rent within six months of your protected activity, states with anti-retaliation laws put the burden on your landlord to prove he or she did not increase your rent in retaliation for the actions you took to protect your rights.  If you live in an apartment complex, finding out the rent your neighbors pay may provide evidence of a pattern of discrimination. In particular, talk to people who are of the same protected group as you to find out if they've had a similar experience with your landlord.  For example, if you are Muslim, talk to other Muslims who live in your complex and find out if they've also received similar notices of a rent increase.  Talk to people in other groups, too, and compare experiences. You may have proof of a pattern of discrimination if people in your group received rent-increase notices while people not in the group received smaller increases or none at all.  Be sure to consider how long people have been living in the complex or other non-discriminatory reasons that may factor into the situation.  You can create a simple chart listing how long the tenants have lived in the complex, the amount of rent paid, and any increases. Be sure to note whether the tenant is a member of the group you believe your landlord is targeting.  If you have reason to believe your landlord has violated state or federal law, send a letter stating your refusal to pay the rent increase. Send your landlord a written letter informing him or her of your refusal – but don't expect your landlord to accept it placidly. You may get a nasty letter back, or your landlord may refer the matter to his or her attorney.  Use certified mail to send your letter so you have proof that your landlord received it.  Although you're refusing to pay the increased rent, you should put into savings the amount of the increase each month. In the event your landlord wins an eviction suit, a judge could order you to pay the entire amount.  When you refuse to pay a rent increase your landlord may attempt to have you evicted.Since discrimination or retaliation are considered defenses to eviction, you typically don't have any opportunity to raise them until your landlord attempts to have you evicted.  Maintain logs and written records of your landlord's activities. You will need these to build your defense against eviction.  Keep copies of any communication between you and your landlord along with any notices of receipt if you mailed your landlord letters using certified mail.  If your landlord says something to you regarding the rental relationship, take a moment to write it down, and send a letter to the landlord confirming your understanding of the statement.  ","determine if you are protected by anti-discrimination laws. talk to your neighbors. refuse to pay the increase. consider consulting an attorney. "

"Choose the important issues to argue. Don’t try to prove what he says isn’t true, because it is nearly impossible unless he makes specific accusations. Just say it isn’t true and let it go.

"Before you ever take your pet for a ride, let them gradually get used to the vehicle. This can be done a number of ways, but one of the simplest is to discover the point at which your dog gets anxious. This can be inches or feet from the car. Whatever the distance, work with your dog to gradually get closer without showing fear or anxiety, by offering them positive feedback, treats, and affection.  Stop your dog at the point closest to the car where they are still calm. Give them a treat, pet them, and go back inside. Every day, repeat this process slightly closer to the car.  When your dog reaches the car, let them sit inside for a few minutes. Repeat this for a few days in a row.  Try turning the car on. After a few days of letting your dog sit in the car with the engine running, take a short trip around the block. Continue this process and gradually extend the length of the trips., Your pet’s safety during travel is important, and much like always remembering to wear your own seatbelt, your dog should be restrained with a harness, net, or crate during any car ride. However, if your dog isn’t used to the restraint, this can be an added form of stress. Take time, weeks or months, to allow your dog to get used to the restraint before using it in the car.If your dog is used to the restraint, seeing the familiar item in the car may actually relieve stress.  Crates and pet carriers are an especially useful travel tool for anxious dogs. Leave the crate in the house with the door open, and over the course of weeks or months, encourage your dog to treat the crate like home.  If you decide to use a net to keep your dog in one part of the car, set the net up in the home for a few days to allow your dog to get used to it. Netting the dog into or out of a hallway is a simple way to do this.  If you want to use a harness, sometimes called a dog seatbelt, to keep your dog safe in the car, let the dog wear the harness for several days without associating it with the car. Build positive associations with the harness.You can give your dog a treat when they wear it, take your dog for a walk with the harness on, or play while your dog is wearing the harness.  Once you’ve increased the duration of your trips past a few minutes, you may want to start having someone else in the car. This second person will be there to pet the dog, talk to them, play with them, and otherwise soothe your dog during car rides. This should be someone your dog is used to, or someone your dog is always very excited to see.  If your dog learns a new trick, say, “Yay. You’re such a good dog. Let’s go for a trip.” Then, take your dog for short ride in the car. If your dog is being extra snuggly and lovey, say, “You’re such a sweet dog. Let’s go for a trip.” You get the idea. The key is to use a happy, positive tone of voice and take the dog somewhere fun like a park.  ","train your dog to stop fearing the car. acclimate your dog to its carrier or restraint. bring along a friend. make car rides a reward. "

"Wearing your hair even partially down can be an issue if you have frizz-prone hair and are getting married outdoors. If you are expecting to be in humid or dry conditions that may make your hair frizzy, you may be better off wearing your hair up.If you are getting married outdoors, wind can also be a factor.

An embellished bridal hair clip, hair comb, and hair pins are ideal for a half up style.  For princess-like feel, pair a tiara with your half up style.  In addition to your veil or headpiece, your dress can help you decide if a half up style is the right option for your wedding. Certain dresses may look better with an up do, so you want to be sure that your hair will work with the dress style.A half up style works well with a V-neck wedding dress.  A strapless or off-the-shoulder dress also works well with a half up style.  In most cases, a half up style isn’t the best choice for a dress with a high neckline, a bateau-neckline, or a one-shoulder design.  If you’re still unsure whether a half up style is the right option for your big day, ask your stylist to do a trial run. You can be sure that you like the way that it looks, and see how it holds up throughout the day to determine if you want to wear it for your wedding.You may want to do trial runs with a few different half up styles to see which one you like best.  While curls are a traditional choice for wedding hairstyles, give your half up style a sophisticated, modern look by going for a smooth blowout instead.

If you want your half up style to be simple but still special, pull it back in a pretty twisted crown. Gather two sections of hair on either side of your face, and twist each before pinning them back. It’s an ideal style whether your hair is naturally straight, wavy, or curly because it works with all hair textures.You can tuck the ends of each twisted section under the other to hide them, or cross them over each other and let them fall for a more natural look.

It will only take attention away from your veil.  While the most common type of half up styles involve pulling the top section of your hair back right at the back of your head, you can often get a more glamorous look if you pin the hair over to one side. Take a section of hair from one side of your head, and push it back to the side of your head.

They don’t have to match exactly, but they should have a similar look.  Instead of smooth, sleek curls that have a more glamorous look, pair your half up style with more relaxed beach-inspired waves. Spray your damp hair with a texturizing or sea salt spray, and allow it to dry naturally. Next, use a large curling iron with a barrel that’s approximately 2-inches (5-cm) wide to loosely curl the hair for soft waves.When you’re going beachy waves, curl large sections of hair so the waves will be loose.
