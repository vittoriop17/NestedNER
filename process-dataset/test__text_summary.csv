"Instead of using toothpaste, dip your toothbrush into a sea salt mixture for 3–5 minutes, made by dissolving ½ teaspoon of salt in 1 fluid ounce of water, and brush your teeth with it.The salt temporarily increases the pH balance of your mouth, turning it into an alkaline environment in which germs and bacteria cannot survive.  You may feel that your gums hurt for a little while and this is absolutely normal because the salt is hygroscopic, meaning it attracts water. Salt can also be abrasive so try using this method no more than once a week.  A salt water mouth rinse after meals can also help keep your mouth and throat clean while soothing and healing mouth sores.  Oil pulling is an Ayurvedic remedy in which you swish oil in your mouth to remove harmful germs and bacteria from your mouth.Vegetable oil contains lipids that absorb toxins and pull them out of saliva, as well as stopping cavity-inducing bacteria from sticking to the walls of your teeth.  Take a spoonful of oil and swish it in your mouth for one minute to gain the benefits. If you can, try to swish the oil longer for 15 to 20 minutes. To make sure the oil absorbs and detoxifies as much bacteria as possible, aim to do this with an empty stomach.  Spit out the oil and rinse out your mouth well, preferably with lukewarm water.  Buy organic, cold-pressed oil. Sesame oil and olive oil can work. Coconut oil is the most popular because of its taste as well as its richness in natural antioxidants and vitamins, such as Vitamin E.  The malic acid in strawberries is a natural emulsifier that helps removes surface stains and plaque.To make your own whitening paste, simply mash two to three strawberries in a cup and add ½ teaspoon of baking soda. Clean your teeth with this paste a few times per week.  Since the malic and citric acid in strawberries can erode enamel, use this remedy in conjunction with a fluoride toothpaste.  Baking soda help whiten teeth and promote overall oral health.Take a teaspoon of baking soda and mix it in two teaspoons of water to make a paste. Brush your teeth with this paste a few times per week.  Baking soda can also be used as a mouth rinse after meals by dissolving one teaspoon of baking soda in a cup of water and swishing it in your mouth for two to three minutes. This creates an alkaline environment in your mouth, which prevents the action of bacteria and neutralizes any dangerous acids.  Apple cider vinegar is a multipurpose household product that also has natural teeth whitening properties.Although results may not be instant, using apple cider vinegar in conjunction with baking soda can help remove surface stains and whiten your teeth.  To make your own teeth whitening paste, mix two teaspoons of apple cider vinegar with ½ teaspoon of baking soda, which can be used a few times per week.  You can also simply use apple cider vinegar as a mouthwash along with your daily oral care routine.  Coconut oil is a natural emulsifier which helps clean your teeth, reduce stains and fight off plaque and cavity causing bacteria.Mix a small amount of mashed peppermint or spearmint leaves (approx. 1–2 grams) with two to three tablespoons of coconut oil to use as a whitening paste or mouthwash. The peppermint leaves help keep your breath fresh throughout the day.  Since coconut oil is gentle and non-abrasive, it can be used daily. It is also safe for people with sensitive teeth and gums.  Many commercial mouthwashes and toothpastes have a 1.5% concentration of hydrogen peroxide, a powerful bleaching agent with a chemical composition that is incredibly close to water. This can help whiten your teeth.Hydrogen peroxide also helps kill bacteria, wash away debris and is especially useful to prevent gingivitis.  As some side effects can occur with prolonged use, ask your dentist about proper usage instructions for your individual needs.  Studies show that chewing sugar-free gum that contains xylitol for 20 minutes a day following meals can help prevent tooth decay.Chewing gum increases saliva production which in turn washes away food debris, neutralizes acids produced by bacteria, strengthens tooth enamel, and provides disease-fighting substances throughout the mouth.  Sugary gum also promotes saliva production but can increase plaque bacteria, so this type of gum should not be used.  Don’t let chewing gum replace brushing and flossing, as these are the most important steps of your oral care routine.  ","dip your toothbrush into a sea salt mixture. try oil pulling. use a strawberry paste. make a baking soda paste. try apple cider vinegar to remove surface stains. fight plaque with coconut oil and mint leaves. give hydrogen peroxide a try. chew a piece of gum.

"Like most things, the first step to getting involved is getting informed and the internet is a great place to start. Take some time to browse your nearby theater's website, if they have one,and read about their mission state, what shows they are casting, if they have crew openings, if they are holding audition, or are in need of donations., They can help direct you and suggest whom to speak with further either by email, phone, or in-person.  Chances are you’ve already visited the theater before as a patron, but if not plan on checking out a show. Stick around after the show, too, and see if you can chat up current cast members. This is a good way to get a vibe of the troupe and get tips or pointers from someone already in the know.  ","research your local theater online. call and speak to a staff member. visit in-person. "

"Don't choose anything too loud, annoying, disturbing; keep it chill. Try to aim for the light pop music and possibly R&B; but not anything that is stressing such as today's Top 40 radio.;  , You'll be happy to have them for those awkward silences that typically happen in conversations between new friends. (For example, 'Wasn't that Spanish test hard?' or 'I saw your performance in the school play. Do you sing a lot?')  , It can be weird if you actually call with the sole purpose of talking. (For example, 'I'm calling to thank you for inviting me to your party,' or 'Can you tell me what the homework was?' or even 'Did you see that episode of Supernatural?')  , Think of all the reasons they will be happy to hear from you.  Inhale through the nose for seven counts, hold for four counts, and exhale for eight counts. Do this three times.  Make sure you do it slowly and concentrate.  What's up?' This gives them a chance to tell you it's a bad time.  It can help spark conversation. (For example, 'Thanks for inviting me to your party. What gifts did you get?' or 'Can you believe what Summer did on The O.C.?')  , Ask any possible question that pops into your head. (For example, 'Thanks for inviting me to your party. What gifts did you get? Who gave that to you? What was your favorite? Were you hoping for anything else? I have one of those...')  , A little preparation can go a long way.  People love to talk about themselves and this is sure to be a big conversation starter. (For example, 'You are a great soccer player. Do you play outside school? How long have you played? Do you watch soccer on television? What's your favorite team? What position do you play? Do you play any other sports? Is soccer hard? Do you train a lot?') Or just start telling your life story, but don't make it a five hour long life story.  Enjoy your conversation rather than thinking about what you're going to say next.

"If you want to stop being sarcastic, the first thing you need to do is determine how and when you use it. If you’re a very sarcastic person, this could be a difficult task. You might not notice every time you use sarcasm, or it may slip out before you can catch yourself.  Pay attention to every word that comes out of your mouth, and jot down a note every time you say something sarcastic.  Who did you say it to? Why? Were you feeling angry, annoyed, frustrated, jealous, or insecure? Try to figure out what caused you to say something sarcastic.;  , These are any situations that elicit sarcasm from you, and you can identify them by looking at your list of sarcastic comments. What did the incidents have in common? Maybe you notice that you use sarcasm every time you are embarrassed. Perhaps you resort to sarcasm when you feel angry or defensive. By figuring out what causes you to use sarcasm, you can be on guard when you're in those situations again.  Some trigger situations may seem vastly different, but have the same root cause. For example, you may use sarcasm toward your girlfriend when she points out something you're doing wrong, as well as in a meeting when you're getting constructive criticism. Both times this sarcasm stems from embarrassment and/or defensiveness.  Trigger situations can be just as easily thought of as 'trigger emotions.'  , This might sound strange, but it can help you closely analyze what you say and identify your sarcastic comments. Pretend that a court reporter is in the room with you, transcribing every word you say. Sarcasm cannot be translated to paper. If you roll your eyes and change the inflection of your voice while sarcastically saying, “Great job!” to someone, that will look like a genuine compliment on paper. If someone reads that conversation later, will it be an accurate reflection of your thoughts and feelings? Did you mean everything you said?  Remember the quote, “Say what you mean and mean what you say.” If you don’t mean what you are saying, and wouldn’t want your name attributed to it on paper, just don’t say it!  , On a scale of one to ten, how sarcastic are you? If you know that you’re a nine or a ten, you will have to work really hard to break that habit. If you only say the occasional sarcastic comment, you will rank yourself lower and it won’t be a total language overhaul. Once you’ve worked on changing your speech, you can rate yourself again.If you use sarcasm multiple times a day, you're on the higher end of the spectrum. If you only find yourself using it a couple times a week, you're on the lower end of the spectrum.  By being honest with yourself about where you stand, you can better measure your progress.  Sometimes others will notice sarcasm from you when you don’t. By telling everyone, they can remind you if you start reverting back to old ways. Make sure that you tell people you see regularly, like a friend, co-worker, or significant other. Tell them to interject whenever they catch you speaking sarcastically.Don't offended when people call you out for sarcasm. You need some tough love if you want to make a real change!  By including others in your goal, you open yourself up to advice and encouragement. Having support from people around you can be extremely helpful when you're making a change.  Create a sarcasm jar, like a swear jar, and put a dollar in it every time you say something sarcastic. By forking over cash every time you let a sarcastic comment slip, you’ll choose your words more carefully— or put a strain on your bank account! When you’ve accumulated a fair amount of money in the jar, use it for something productive, like a bill.Don't use the money for a treat. That money a penalty payment, so it cannot be used for something fun.  Place the jar somewhere you can see it, so that your goal is always on your mind. It will serve as a physical reminder to watch your words and avoid using sarcasm.  Maybe you saw a friend being sarcastic and you realized how unflattering it is. Perhaps you hurt someone’s feelings unintentionally, and want to work on speaking more kindly. Whatever your reasoning, make sure you remind yourself of it regularly. You can become the person you want to become, you just have to stay focused on your goal.Try writing these reminders down and posting them somewhere that you'll see everyday.  This can be something like randomly telling a friend something you really admire about them, or telling a stranger on the bus that you like their shoes or their bag. Maybe you just want to tweet something every day that makes you genuinely happy. It doesn't matter what you do, just make sure it is earnest, kind, and uplifting. Not only will you get into the habit of speaking truthfully, but you will also start creating a new image of yourself to the people around you.  Even if you are having a horrible day and don't particularly want to challenge yourself, just do it. You will feel better afterwards, because kindness is contagious.  Say you noticed yourself being sarcastic every time you hung out with a particular group of people that made you feel insecure. Rather than speaking sarcastically, try speaking genuinely. You can offer them sincere compliments, while remarking on your own great characteristics. If you notice that you speak sarcastically whenever you’re angry with co-workers, try addressing your frustrations instead of using sarcasm to ridicule or vent.  Treat words as if they are valuable currency. By using your language to convey truthful, straightforward, sincere thoughts, you are getting the most bang for your “buck.”  , This should be someone who speaks earnestly, without any sarcasm. It doesn’t matter whether you speak with them directly or just admire from afar. How can you emulate them? How does their sincerity make you feel? Sarcasm can hurt and mock others, reveal a lack of confidence, and put others on the defensive.Identify someone who makes people laugh without using sarcasm or hurting others. It is empowering and motivating to see someone who can make real, earnest jokes without putting anyone down.  Bad habits can sneak back into our lives easily if we aren’t vigilant, especially when we are feeling frustrated. Remember why you wanted to remove sarcasm from your language in the first place, and constantly check yourself. If you observe and evaluate yourself with honesty and you notice that you’re saying insincere, sarcastic things, try to figure out why.Address any issues that are causing you distress or making you feel uncomfortable. Attempt to fix the problems that are causing you to revert to your sarcastic language.  Remind yourself that kindness and sincerity will get you farther than sarcasm and mockery ever will.  If you are constantly blurting out cynical, sarcastic remarks and you just can't seem to hold back, the issue may be deeper than simply breaking a habit. Don't be ashamed to spend time 'getting in touch with your emotions,' or even asking for help. Often times, sarcasm can be used as a defense mechanism or an emotional crutch, so solving the core problem can help change your speech.If you realize you use sarcasm as a means to feel better about yourself, try to find other ways to raise your self-esteem and feel empowered, without sacrificing the feelings of others.Spend time doing a hobby you love, exercise, and surround yourself with people who make you feel confident.  If you believe you are struggling with anger issues or depression, don't be afraid to ask for help from a psychologist or psychiatrist.  ","take note every time you say something sarcastic. identify your 'trigger situations.', imagine that all of your words are being written down. rate your sarcasm usage. tell everyone about your goal to stop being sarcastic. create a system to penalize yourself. remind yourself why you want to reduce the sarcasm. give yourself an 'anti-sarcasm' challenge every day. practice handling “trigger situations” differently. observe someone who speaks particularly kindly and genuinely. reevaluate yourself regularly. dig deeper to the root of the problem if you continue to struggle.

"You won't always have time to visit the zoo, farm, or forest, but you can still photograph nature. Look for cloud formations, birds on a wire, bugs and bees, wet smooth pebbles in shallow water, pine cones, and sea shells. Develop your eye for finding these snippets of nature, and viewing them as photography subjects. As a beginner, it's easier to focus on the technical details of photography when you're not awed by a beautiful landscape.  With the advent of good cell phone cameras, you don't need to wait until you've grabbed all your equipment. Get in the habit of taking nature photos while on a walk, in the grocery store produce aisle, or watching rain or snow fall from inside your house.;  , Crouch down to get a new perspective on these little living things. Photographs from above tend only to capture the details that we see in everyday encounters.  The default approach is to photograph an object head-on. There's nothing wrong with this perspective, but any subject has many more to offer. Here are a few examples of ways to photograph a stand of trees:  Lying on the ground beneath them, looking up.  From the hill above it, looking down.  Sitting on an opposite tree branch, level with the canopy.  Close up on the bark, a leaf, a stem, or any of the hundreds of parts that make up a tree.  Focused on one of these objects, but capturing a soft background behind it.  From water to blowing grass to brambles, nature has an infinite variety of visual textures. Contrast a sharp flower with a splashing raindrop, or the fluffiness of a cumulus cloud with a flat sheet of ice.  The same location can look radically different at different times of day. The best time for nature photography is usually just after sunrise or just after sunset. The natural atmospheric lighting at these times provide warmth and shadows, for a varied and balanced composition. Closer to mid-day, the light tends to be too flat and bright.  Flowers are best photographed on days with no wind and a slightly overcast sky, to avoid shadows of the petals obscuring the colorful blooms.  Low levels of light generally make natural scenes appear more authentic. They enhance contrast as well, which leads to great photographs. Picture the crisp difference between dark water and a light sky.  When you're composing an image with a clear horizon line or another dividing horizontal line, never place it at the center of the photograph. Position it either ⅓ of the distance from the top of the photo, or ⅓ from the bottom.  Hone your composition skills to find that perspective that draws the viewer in. There are many ways to accomplish this goal:  Tree branches or bushes as foreground objects, framing the subject.  A curving path or road drawing the viewer in.  Diagonal lines from anything at all — a rock formation, a bent tree.  A gradation of color.  Nature scenes that contain a clamor of color are easy to find, and can certainly be beautiful. But challenge yourself to find moments of a single, vivid color on a plain backdrop. A bare, Burnt Umber bush over snow; the Early Spring Green of just-open leaves on white birch; the simple Forest Green of a canopy framed by sky.  Take your time to locate the right shot, especially when photographing animals. Roam your surroundings with your feet and your eyes, and wait patiently and quietly for opportunity and inspiration to strike.  A macro lens is invaluable for extreme close-up subjects, such as insects, worms, and snails. If you want to take distance shots, such as when you're trying to capture elusive animal subjects, find a zoom lens with at least an 80–100mm focal length.  If you have a camera with adjustable controls, learn what a change in aperture does to the focus point of the photo. Do you want a picture from here to infinity? A smaller aperture with a higher f/stop (f8 to f22) will result in a deep depth of field (DOF). For a shallow depth of field, with a single focal point on a blurred background, set the camera to a larger opening with a lower f/stop (f2 to f5.6).  The depth of field is defined as the depth of the zone in which the image is razor sharp.  If you can slow down the shutter, you can capture wonderful cascading waterfalls, or waves crashing against rocks. Place your camera on a sturdy tripod or flat surface before shooting, or the moving subject will blur.  To photograph birds and other speedy subjects without blurring, increase the shutter speed. Because the shutter only has a moment to let in light, you'll also need a fast lens, meaning a lens that opens extra wide to let in enough light in that moment.  The flash feature will also help 'freeze' a single moment, though it may startle your subject.  ","look for nature in the everyday. photograph small animals and flowers down at eye level. explore different angles and perspectives. pay attention to textures. play with sunlight. learn the rule of thirds. lead the viewer’s eye into the photograph. show off a single color. be patient. add specialized lenses. adjust the aperture. reduce shutter speed for water photography. increase shutter speed for fast-moving animals.

"Make sure the stained area is not resting on another part of the fabric. Place a towel underneath the area on which you’re working. This will ensure that the ink stain will not run through the fabric and stain more of the fabric.  Rub in enough salted butter to cover the stain, using either a cloth. Rub the stained area in a circular motion, moving and frequently turning the cloth over to prevent the spread or transfer of ink.  Find a place where the item will be undisturbed and sheltered from any rain. An outside location in the direct sunlight is best. Allow the item to sit for a couple of days. The butter’s oil will soften up and break up the stain. The salt from the butter, coupled with the sunlight, will help to lift the stain.Wash the fabric in the washing machine. Put a regular amount of laundry detergent in the washing machine and set it to use hot water. Do not include other items in the washing machine so that you don’t risk any transfer of the ink to another item.  If the fabric is not washable (vinyl, for example), wipe away the butter with a clean damp cloth. Apply a small amount of gentle laundry detergent to the cloth to help clean off the butter.  The stain should be gone, but if there is still a trace, repeat the process of applying butter to the stain. Wash the fabric again and if the stain is gone, then proceed to dry the fabric as usual.  ","place a towel under the fabric. apply butter to the stained area. set the fabric item in the sunlight. check the fabric before drying. "
"If your lips are chapped or flaky, your lipstick may appear uneven and bumpy. To avoid this, exfoliate your lips first to make sure they are nice and smooth before applying any lipstick.You can pick up a lip exfoliant at a beauty supply store, or you can use a DIY method. The smoother your lips are, the smoother the lipstick will go on.  ;  , After your lips are exfoliated, you can enhance their silkiness even more by putting on a light coat of lip balm. This will help keep your lips moisturized and help the dark color to glide on smoothly and evenly. Apply your lip balm, and wait a couple minutes while it soaks into your lips.  This isn't directly related to applying your lipstick, but it's a crucial step. You will not be able to brush your teeth after applying your lipstick without messing up your careful work.

"Avoid using a plain brown lunch sack for an adult goodie bag. Those are fine for kids, but for an adult you should use a higher quality bag that looks classy. Most craft stores have an enormous selection of gift bags in a broad range of sizes, colors and materials.  Select a sturdy bag made of quality materials and make sure the handles are secure.  Choose a simple bag that is all one color so that you can easily customize it with creative embellishments.  Have a good idea of what you want to put in your bag before making a purchase or doing any decorating. Consider the weight and size of the items so that your bag will be able to accommodate the goodies.;  , You could get really creative and choose a vessel that ties in thematically with the goodies themselves or a vessel is actually part of the gift itself.  For example, if you want to fill the bag with cooking-related items for a chef, use a nice steel mixing bowl to hold the items instead of a bag. Doing this keeps the design elements consistent and the chef can actually use the steel mixing bowl later.  Go green.Consider choosing a bag that is made with recycled materials or one that can be repurposed later, like a canvas bag.  An easy way to maintain the perceived sophistication of the adult goodie bag is to keep all of the design elements consistent.This can be as simple as choosing a color theme for the gift and keeping that color consistent with the packaging, decorations and items inside the bag.  For example, get a nice yellow bag and fill it with goodies that are yellow or packaged in yellow. Something as simple as that will make the gift appear visually cohesive and the overall effect will look sophisticated and high quality.  Are you bringing it to a birthday party or giving it to the recipient one-on-one? Is it a gift for a co-worker that you are presenting at an office party? You can then tailor the bag to fit the event.  If you were attending a woman’s birthday beach party, you could choose a yellow/blue color theme that reflects the colors of the ocean and the sand. Using a canvas beach bag as the vessel would tie the gift into the party.  You could fill the bag with yellow/blue items that can be used at the beach, like a nice pair of designer sunglasses, a big fluffy beach towel, quality sunscreen, water-resistant wireless mini speakers, lip balm with SPF and a cute pair of flop flops.  You are already using quality materials for the bag itself, and customizing it with a few additional design elements will add a personal flair to compliment the overall presentation. Since you are going for a classy looking bag, keep these additional elements to a minimum.  Try adding some curly ribbon that matches the color theme, tying them around the bag handles.  Get some nice postcard-sized cardstock with an interesting pattern and glue it on the bag, along with a paper cut out of the first letter of the recipient’s first name (you can find those at any craft store) to give the bag a posh, monogrammed look.  Affix tasteful cut out paper shapes that contribute to the theme or color scheme. Stickers are also an option, but opt for upscale designer stickers, like those used for scrapbooking (you can find these in any craft store).  In most cases you will want to get some filler for the bag, such as tissue paper, shredded crinkle paper or cellophane paper. All of those come in every color of the rainbow, so choose something that enhances the design elements you have in place.  Filler, along with looking nice, will also protect the items inside the bag and keep them hidden until the recipient opens the gift.  Tailor your budget to fit the relationship you have with the recipient. In other words, you’ll probably want to spend more on a close friend than a co-worker. Regardless of who the person is to you, give yourself a budget. Adult goodies can get pricy very quickly, so it’s good to have some limitations in place.  To keep yourself on track when selecting items to put in the bag, continually ask yourself, “Is this something I would appreciate receiving myself?”  , For a friend, choose upscale items that are tailored to what you know about them. For people that you don’t know well, choose items that are a little more neutral that anyone could enjoy.  For an artist friend you could put all art-related items in the bag, like paint brushes, a small paint set, a book about their favorite artist, a beautifully bound sketch book and/or two tickets to an art film showing in your city.  For a co-worker you could use a dark brown coffee-themed bag and cream colored tissue paper. Inside you could put a nice mug, a few bags of high-end coffee, a small bag of bakery-made biscotti and a gift card for Starbucks.  Everyone appreciates receiving things that are useful and functional. Gift cards fall into this category and since these days you can get a gift card to almost anything, tailor your choice to the person. Restaurants, department stores, craft stores, wine shops, book stores – the possibilities are endless.  Other ideas would be movie tickets, sports tickets or tickets for a night at the symphony.  Smaller useful items are great too – travel sized hand sanitizers that are high end or decorated could be included, or a well-designed pen.  Don’t go overboard with your choices – pick 3 to 6 quality items that are well-made and nice to look at and leave it at that. When paired with the sophisticated, well-designed packaging you’ve created, even the smallest of gift bags come off as swanky and thoughtful.  No birthday goodie bag is complete without a card for the recipient. Whether custom-made or store bought, include a card that ties in with the rest of the gift in color and/or theme. Sign it and place it into the bag last, so that it is on the top when the recipient opens it.  For bags, add 2 or 3 small pieces of double sided tape near the top and press both sides of the top together to secure the bag closed. If you are using something other than a bag, do whatever you can to secure everything in place.  Putting cellophane wrap around baskets and other similar vessels is a common solution.  Your bag is nearly complete, so go ahead and give it a little test to make sure the bag is stable, the items don’t move around and that it remains closed. Pick it up by the handles and walk around the room. If it’s sturdy but a little heavy, carry and present the bag with your hand on the bottom of the bag to support it.  Now that you are looking at the bag in its finalized state, you may get a last-minute idea for an embellishment or addition. Resist the temptation to add a bunch of new elements to the bag – just tweak it a little.  Add a little more curly ribbon or glue a few more shapes or patterned paper onto the bag. Purchase and tie on a helium-filled balloon in a complimentary color, if you like.  Craft stores sell trim that comes in sticker form to be used on paper and in scrapbooks, so try adding a little trim to one or all of the bag’s sides.  Tuck a single fresh flower into the top of the bag so that the stem is secure in the bag and the flower itself peeks out of the top.  ","choose a tasteful bag. think outside the bag.you could use a basket, a decorative box, or any other receptacle that is clean and the right size for the goodies. decide on a theme. consider where you will be presenting the bag. decorate the bag. don’t forget filler. set a budget. focus on quality over quantity.instead of handing over a giant bag filled with mostly useless and throwaway items, aim for fewer items that are stylish, sophisticated and useful. make sure the goodies reflect the recipient. select useful items. keep it simple. include a birthday card. close the bag securely. test the bag’s stability. add finishing touches.

"Since you may not have the ability to search online, make sure you have as much information about the case as possible to make it easier for the municipal clerk to search for the documents you need.  Municipal court records are maintained by those individual courts and are not available using any state-run database or the Wisconsin State Law Library., Each municipal court has its own website, which will have contact information for the clerk's office as well as additional information for how to get court records.  Typically municipal court records will be available to the public during normal business hours if you have the ability to go to the courthouse in person., You can go to the clerk's office of the city court where the case was heard, or send a written request to that clerk, or to the records custodian. Check the court's website to learn exactly where you need to send your request.You may not be able to view the records without staff supervision, or make copies on your own. You will be charged a fee per page for any copies made of records. For example, the Milwaukee Municipal Court charges $0.25 per page for copies., The time it takes to fulfill your records request will depend on the size of the city and the volume of requests the court has to fill.  For example, the Milwaukee Municipal Court indicates that it tries to fulfill record requests within two hours, but if a request is going to take longer it will let you know the date and time your records will be available.

"Cut the food you don’t like into the smallest pieces you can so that you don’t have to chew as much and you can mix it in easier with other foods. You might even be able to swallow pieces whole, but be careful not to swallow too-large or hard pieces that might get stuck in your throat.;  , Surround the food you don’t like with other food you do like on your plate. If you don’t like asparagus, for example, you could push it into a ball of mashed potatoes before putting it in your mouth. Also try simply putting a bite of something you like in your mouth and holding it there as a sort of barrier for your taste buds before you put in a bite of the bad food.  Sip from a glass of water, soda, juice, or alcohol right before you take a bite, and then take another sip directly after to replace the taste quickly and help wash the food down.  Add salt and pepper, butter, some lemon juice, ketchup or mustard, or anything else available on the table. Be careful not to noticeably overdo on your seasonings, or ask for something that’s not already available or would clearly not go with the dish, to avoid offending the cook or your fellow diners.  Breathe in through your nose before taking a bite of the offending food, then try not to breathe in or out while you’re chewing and swallowing to dampen the flavor.  Don’t feel like you need to eat the entire quantity of the food you don’t like at a dinner party or other social situation. Eat enough that it appears that you’ve enjoyed most of it and are just too full to have the rest. Leave small amounts of other foods on your plate too, so that it doesn’t look like you neglected one thing.  ","cut the food into small pieces and swallow. eat it with something you do like. drink something before and after. cover the food with seasonings or condiments. restrict your sense of smell. eat only a polite amount.

"If you want to adopt as a single woman, you need to find adoption agencies that are willing to adopt to single parents. Start your search with agencies near you, and make a list of several different agencies.Most adoption agencies have websites, so you can do much of this initial searching on the internet. You also can find tips and information on adoption community websites and online forums.  Look for agencies that have information specifically about single-parent adoption. Just because an agency doesn't have a policy against single-parent adoption doesn't necessarily mean they encourage or support single-parent adoption.;  , Many American mothers who've put their children up for adoption don't want them to go to single-parent homes. You'll typically have a lot better luck if you're interested in adopting a child from a developing country.If you want to adopt a baby, international adoption probably is your best bet as a single woman. Many American birth mothers putting infants up for adoption refuse to adopt to a single parent.  Before you decide which agency you want to use, take the time visit the agency and talk to the people who work there about your desire to adopt as a single woman. If staff seem critical or resistant, that probably isn't the right agency for you.Most agencies have a welcome meeting that you can attend. They'll go over the adoption process and answer any questions you have. Ask if they've successfully placed children with single mothers, and what their policy is regarding single-parent adoptions.  You also may have the opportunity to talk to parents who have adopted children through that agency and learn more about their experiences.  When you start the process of adopting a child as a single woman, you may not fully understand the demands and challenges of single parenting. Take your decision seriously and read as much as you can about coping strategies and tips from other single parents.A caseworker interviewing you for an agency may ask you questions based on how you anticipate handling any of these challenges. Researching ensures you at least have a general idea how to respond and don't appear completely unprepared.  You need to have a general idea of how you will handle various situations that might come up with your child. For example, if the school calls you and tells you that your child is sick, you need to know if you'll be free to leave work to pick up your child, or if you have a close friend or family member who could pick up your child for you.  You may face resistance from adoption agencies and others who are concerned that as a single parent, you will be unable to adequately meet the physical, emotional, and spiritual needs of a child on your own. It helps if you have a strong network of family and friends.For example, suppose your parents are retired and live near you. They may be willing to help take care of your child while you're at work.  Close friends and neighbors also can help take care of your child and provide support when you need it. Talk to everyone close to you and find out what they would be willing to do to help.  You may be eligible for subsidies that can help cover some of your immediate adoption expenses. However, once the adoption is complete, you'll be on your own. Make sure you have the means to support a child for the next 10 to 20 years, depending on the age of the child you want to adopt.You don't have to be wealthy to adopt a child, but the more financially secure you are, the better your chances of being able to adopt as a single woman.  If you're carrying a lot of debt, it may be a good idea to pay some of that down before you think about adopting a child. That way you'll be on more stable financial footing when you begin the adoption process.  If you have trouble finding an agency you like that will work with single parents, you might become a foster parent instead. Foster parents make a serious impact on a child's life, and you may have the opportunity to adopt a child you foster.Unlike adoption, you also are eligible to receive monthly payments to help financially support any foster children you care for.  Fostering children also can be a good way to demonstrate that you are capable of handling a child on your own. A strong foster care record makes you a strong candidate for adoption.  State agencies, as well as a number of private agencies, typically have classes you must complete to learn about adoption and the needs of adoptive children.If you're adopting through a state agency, you may have to qualify as both a foster parent and an adoptive parent – even if you're not planning on fostering a child. When adopting through a private agency, you may have to pay a fee to attend parenting classes.  During the training sessions, you'll go through the adoption application. If you have any questions about the process or any of the items on the application, ask a staff member for clarification.  You must provide thorough personal and financial information to adopt a child. You'll need to attach documentation to your application that supports the statements you made in the application itself.You'll have to verify your employment and income, and the adoption agency may contact your employer.  You also must provide identification that proves you meet the minimum age for adoptive parents in your state.  Ask your employer, family members, or other colleagues or community members to write reference letters for you to support your application to adopt.  Adoption agencies require you to submit an application, either in person or online, along with all required documents and letters of reference. Before you submit your application, double-check and make sure you have answered all questions honestly and completely.If you have any issues that you think might negatively impact the agency's decision, you might want to write a statement explaining the situation and how you've changed. For example, if you've ever been arrested or convicted of a crime, you want to address this up front on your application and discuss it openly.  Once your application is accepted by the agency, you'll be assigned a caseworker who will be your point person throughout the adoption process. They will describe to you the next steps of the process.You need to maintain a good relationship with your caseworker. They are on your side, and want to help you adopt a child. They can answer any questions you have, as well as give you tips and advice.  In most states, you must pass a criminal and employment background check before you will be finally approved to adopt. Typically you must request your criminal history from the FBI and the state law enforcement agencies of any states where you've lived.You also must show that you've never been listed on any child abuse, domestic violence, or sex offender registries.  If you have friends or family members who either live in your home or will be frequent visitors, they also may be required to submit criminal histories.  Either your caseworker or another evaluator typically will conduct a home study to evaluate the home environment you plan to provide for the child you adopt.Since the home study is more in-depth than the application, you'll need additional documents that provide information about your home life and personal history. Pull any legal documents, such as diplomas, divorce decrees, or birth certificates, that relate to significant events in your life.  You also may need to get a physical exam and submit a health report as part of your home study. Generally, they want to make sure you don't have any serious health problems that could negatively affect your ability to raise a child.  As part of your home study, your caseworker will interview both you and any friends or family members. They will visit and inspect your home and the space you have available for a child. The main purpose of the home study is to make sure you're adequately prepared to be a parent.Your caseworker should let you know if they find anything that might cause your application to be rejected, and give you advice on what to do with it. Through the home study, your caseworker is trying to help you get approved – not looking for reasons to reject you.  If you went with a private agency, you typically must pay additional fees for the home study. These fees range anywhere from several hundred to several thousand dollars. Your caseworker will explain the fees and payment options available.  Once your home study is complete, your case worker will create a written report of your home study. Typically you'll have a meeting where they will go over the report with you and answer any questions you have.The home study report typically must be approved by someone else in the agency. They typically will follow your case worker's recommendation.  If there are any aspects of your home study that your case worker thinks might cause you to be rejected as an adoptive parent, they will talk to you about those issues. There may be things you can do to eliminate or lessen those issues.  Provided you're approved as an adoptive parent after your home study is completed, your caseworker will start giving you information about children who are available for adoption.Your case worker will talk to you about your preferences for adoption, such as your age or gender preferences. They also will look at information about your lifestyle to help find the best possible matches for you.  Talk to your case worker about activities you enjoy or other hobbies, particularly if you're thinking about adopting an older child. The case worker can be on the lookout for children who enjoy those activities as well.

"Smuggling Kitty into work won't be a good idea if your cat is a proud and independent roamer who has activities you don't even have a clue about for most of the day and/or night. If he is the type to hop in and out of the cat door regularly, he is going to find being confined in a small bag a day of nightmares and the yowling will definitely let the cat out of the bag even if the clawing doesn't.  Alternatively, if your cat is quiet and often comfortable sitting near you for long periods of time, he may the an ideal stealth cat for the office.;  , Is your cat a seasoned traveler? Does he mind car or public transportation travel? Is he even allowed on public transportation? Are you strong enough to carry him on your bike or by foot? These are all very valid considerations.  If the last experience your cat had of going in a cat carrier involved going to the vet, seeing rabid, dribbling dogs nosing him and he urinated all over himself, then perhaps give this whole idea a miss. On the other hand, if he's the model of good behavior and loves travelling, you're on your way!  , Is it too hot, too cold, too wet or too windy to be carrying your cat around? Use your own good sense of judgement as to whether the weather is an issue for carting around your feline pal, especially if you're subjecting him to non-car travel. In particular, remember that cats are prone to heatstroke, so don't place him in any situation where this could be a problem.  Preferably, choose a day when you can get away earlier than usual, so that your feline pal is only there a few hours.  This will enable you to ascertain the best way to get your cat into the office and away from everyone. Mentally review your boss’s schedule in order to determine if there are any opportunities where you might get caught. For the cautious cat smuggler, try the following tips:  Know the layout of your office so that you know precisely, where your boss will be sitting in relation to your area – in particular, know his or her line of sight to your desk or workspace.  Evaluate your workspace or office area to determine where you will keep the cat while you're working at your desk. Map out where he’ll sit and the best place to keep him concealed from the boss and any nosy co-workers.  Review any obstacles or hurdles you might face, such as a meeting or your lunch plans.  Look over your schedule to identify the best day for your cat to come to work. Days that you have to work late or have numerous meetings are likely days to avoid because your cat will be frisky and bored after long hours.  Buy or find a ventilated bag, preferably one that will conceal your animal and allow you to bring cat food, treats, quiet toys, a soft blanket and even a travel litter box.  Make sure that the bag is not a designated cat or animal carrier - the cat will certainly be out of the proverbial bag if you sneak the cat in using a cat carrier. That is, unless you're able to cloak the carrier and stash it in a corner behind the filing cabinet.  That way, everyone will be used to seeing you carry 'your new' bag and not suspect anything out of the ordinary.  Even if you typically don’t harness or leash your cat, you'll need a system to keep him nearby. Get the cat used to wearing the harness and leash a few days prior to sneaking him into work.  Stuff the food, harness, leash, toys, litter and blanket into side or surrounding pockets. If your travel litter box will fit, add the box, but be sure you can still fit the cat into the bag the next morning.  A squashed cat is not the target of your mission. Any items that will not fit into the bag comfortably (when your cat is inside) should be either left at home or could be transferred to your purse or possibly to another bag, made to look like 'all that extra work you did at home last night'. However, be careful because bringing too many bags into the office may draw attention toward you - the idea is to bring one bag containing the cat for the total sneak attack.  If questioned, say you have to return a lot of library books after work.  Do a test run by packing the bag and then add the cat. The cat may need some practice being inside the bag so give him time to adjust and see the bag as a safe place.  This is a good time to discover your cat's suitability or otherwise to participate in this venture. If he yowls persistently and claws you frantically, he's telling you something loud and clear.  Don't just leave him in the bag. Walk around with him in the bag and try travel with him too. You need to know what he's capable of before carrying out operation cat sneak.  Give him quality food in a decent amount so that he isn’t starving and meowing for food when you arrive at work.  This is vital to avoid him having an accident in the bag. This may entail spending a good 10 minutes or so enticing him in the vicinity of the litter box. If you're up to smuggling him in, you're up to this part of the procedure too.  He needs to know you still love him and that this upheaval is a temporary state of affairs.  By shortening the amount of time your cat is in the bag, you are also lessening the amount of trauma (and meowing).  A cat that won't go into the bag frontward will be easier backed into the bag. Needless to say though, if you're having this much trouble getting him in, perhaps it's not the right day or time to be doing this.  If you act like you have nothing to hide, no one will suspect that you do! Remember – your co-workers have seen you carry the same bag before so they have no reason to suspect you have brought in your cat. After all, it's not really the first thing coworkers imagine when another co-worker arrives at work – 'Oh, Alice must have a cat in her bag.'  , Walk briskly to your desk and avoid any water cooler chit chat. When you get to your desk, close your office door or if you are in a cubicle, slide the cat bag underneath your desk into a position that's as well hidden as possible. Put your usual bag up against the front to hide the cat's bag, or use files, the recycling bin or a printer paper box to provide cover.  Pull out any work you typically do first thing in the morning. Reassure your cat that all is good and give him time to settle before moving him again.  Clearly, if you've packed his worldly belongings into the bag, you need to remove those as a minimum because he needs to stay comfortable. The fear from the new surroundings, noises, smells and the whole indignity of being taken in to work might be too much for him and he could express his displeasure through yowling, biting, scratching and urinating. If you think it's okay to let him out, the following steps explain what to do next.  Determine if he even wants to leave. He may want to stay cocooned inside the cozy carrier for a good part of the morning – if that's the case, then let him. He's better off quiet and undisturbed than being petrified.  Put the harness and leash on the cat before he leaves the bag. That way you won’t risk him running out of your workspace. If he wants to sit underneath your desk wrap loop of the leash around your ankle so he stays close and no one can see you have a leash attached to you.  ,,, This will allow you to escape crowds or peak hour traffic, all things that could potentially cause kitty stress.  Shut down your computer and put away all the files, etc. Place your cat back in just before you're ready to leave. Wish your coworkers a cheerful farewell and head on out of there. Mission accomplished! You've successfully sneaked your cat into work for a day!  ","assess your cat's personality to decide if he is the sort of cat that could be happy and quiet at work. consider the way you get to work. check the weather. choose a day that isn't heavily mired in away-from-desk obligations. be absolutely certain of where your boss and other co-workers will be throughout the day. prepare the cat's necessities. start bringing the bag to work at least one to two weeks prior to sneaking the animal into the office. purchase a cat harness and a leash. pack everything you’ll need into the bag to determine if you can fit all items inside. if the cat doesn’t fit or seems cramped, reconfigure how you packed your travel bag. for a smooth transition from home to office, prepare your cat bag a few days before you plan to sneak your cat into work. feed your cat breakfast. encourage your cat to use the litter box. give your cat lots of affection and attention before you place him in the bag. instead of transferring the cat to your bag while you get ready for work, make the transfer the last thing you do before you leave the house. be confident. look around to see if anyone is around your office or desk. turn on your computer and get set up for the day. decide whether having your cat let out of the bag is a sensible option. double check your surroundings before you encourage your cat to come out of the bag. when your cat seems ready to leave, unpack the cat and encourage him to get to know your workspace. place the blanket underneath your desk and put food and water in the small bowls. , anticipate his needs by setting up the litter box after an hour of being out of the bag. , give him treats and toys when he appears to be getting antsy. , target to go home earlier than usual. place your cat's items back in the bag.

"You can buy fleece in a variety of colors, patterns and thicknesses. Choose your fleece according to needed warmth and personal style, using whatever patterns and colors you want.  You can choose accessories such as buttons, sequins or gems to add later if you'd like.;  , Most adult heads are approximately 21 to 23 inches (53.3 to 58.4 cm) around. Fleece has some stretch to it, so you should be able to use a 23-inch (58.4-cm) hat pattern for most people.  You want the stretch of the fabric to run across the width of your head, so that it will fit tightly. Check which direction the fabric stretches, too. What direction does it naturally pull towards?  This is also going to show you where the back side of the fleece is -- if you stretch the fleece between two hands, the fabric will naturally curl towards the backside (the side touching your head) of the fleece., You'll need a pattern to help you cut the right shapes and sizes out of your fabric. Search for 'fleece beanie pattern' online and check out the shapes that you like. There are often subtle variations between hats, and this is your chance to choose the exact design you want.  Make sure your print it 'to size.' Do not print it to 'fit page,' as the actual size of the pattern is crucial! Print at 100% or 'actual size.' They often provide a 1-inch square on the design that you can check with a ruler.  Most fleece beanie patterns differ slightly in their construction. They will have 4 side panels and a bottom band. Some patterns will allow you to work from one piece, while others will separate the fleece into up to five pieces.  The following measurements provide more than enough fleece to make your hat from. Cut a rectangle of fleece that is approximately 23 inches (58.4 cm) wide by 12 inches (30.5 cm) tall. Reduce the measurements to 19 inches (48.3 cm) wide or 21 inches (53.3 cm) wide for a toddler or smaller adult, respectively.  When in doubt, leave a 1/2 inch of excess -- you can always cut it later, but it can make construction easier.  Across the width means folding it like a sandwich, not like a hotdog bun. (14.6 cm by 30.5 cm). You should have a long, doubled up rectangle of fabric.  Make sure that the point of the beanie aligns with the top of the longer side (30.5-cm). There will be a long horizontal line through the pattern, usually labeled 'stretch.' This line needs to be lined up with the natural stretch of the fabric, found earlier.  Repeat on another stretch of fabric, preferably close to the first cut, so that you have 4 total domed pieces.  Make sure the pattern doesn't move on the fabric as you cut. Pinning it down with sewing needles is a good way to keep everything straight. Use at least two pins, if so.  If you want a solid colored beanie, cur out four more domes from the same fleece. Simply repeat the process above with a new fabric for a reversible hat.  By now, you should have at least eight pieces of fabric in the dome-like beanie shape.  Some patterns simply attach the domed pieces into a beanie, but that classic 'lip' of a beanie is easy to add. This will be a rectangular piece of pattern, which you cut right at the fold in your fleece. This leads to one piece of fabric that is twice as long as your pattern, but folded in half so that it appears the same size. You will need two of these.  Remember to cut half in one pattern, half in the other pattern, if you're making a reversible hat.  When finished cutting, you should have a total of 10 pieces of fabric:  8 pieces of dome shaped fabric.  4 in one color, 4 in another.  2 long pieces for the trim.  1 in one color, 1 in another.  You will want to sew on the side that will be the inside of your hat. Remember that you can stretch the fabric to find what side is the back if it is not obvious. The side the fabric curls towards, when stretched, is the back.  You want the good sides facing each other. Follow the curve with your sewing machine (1/4 inch seam allowance) to attach the two pieces, almost like a book. Use a straight stitch.  Make sure the overlap goes wrong-side-out, on the side that will soon be the inside of your hat. You will need to feed your fabric through the machine in a curved motion so that it follows the dome shape.  When you get to the last side, pin the sides together and sew from the bottom of the hat to the top of the last dart tip. You should end up with four sewed together pieces.  Take two of your book-like domes and place them together, good sides touching. Then pin them at the top, matching along the center seam. Try to make sure the seams both face the opposite way to prevent getting bulky. Do this with all four books, so you end up with two sets of matching fabrics pinned together.  This will finally attach each of the four pieces of matching fabric into a 'mini-beanie.' Simply sew along the entire long edge of the dome, using the same 1/4 inch seam allowance, and a straight stitch. Repeat with the other set of fabric, leaving your two small beanies.  Measure and fold a 3-inch (7.3-cm) hem at the bottom of your hat. You will now make the band at the bottom of your hat.  Touch the shorter sides together, matching them up perfectly, then sew the two short ends together so you end up with a fabric ring. Repeat with the other hem piece.  Wrap the ring of fabric around your hat, lining up the seam of the ring with one of the hat's seams. Pin it here and on the opposite side. Then use as many pins as you need to match up the edges, lining them up so you can sew them cleanly.  You want the good side of the hat fabric to be touching the good side of the hem fabric. Remember to stretch to check if need be.  You may need to remove the sewing table extension, making it easier to sew in a circle. Use the same 1/4 inch straight seam, and slowly sew all the way around the bottom edge of the hat and ring to attach them.  Repeat with the opposite hat and hem as well.  For a little extra fun, mix up the fabrics -- use the hem from one fleece with the hat from the other.  There is one place on each hat where the seam of the hat and hem are lined up. Press these seams together, then flip one hat over the other one so that they are nested in each other, like stacked plastic cups.  This is your opening to allow the hat to flip successfully. Pin and sew the two hats together just like you sewed the hem onto the bottom of the hat. This time, however, you need to leave about 2' of the edge unsewed, allowing you to pull it out easily.  You'll end up with a weird, bean-shaped fabric oval. Reach into the opening with your fingers and gently pull the fabric back through.  Push half of the oval into the other half, leaving you with your finished beanie! Stitch together the little opening you made to finish the edge and prevent it from unraveling.  ","buy 1 yard (0.9 m) of the fleece of your choice at a local craft store. measure the circumference of your head. feel the way your fleece stretches before you set it on your table to mark and cut. download, print, and cut out a pattern for your hat online. cut a long piece of fabric from the cloth to work with. fold the fabric in half across the width, making sure to align the ends. place the printed template on top of the piece of folded fabric. use sharp fabric scissors to cut through both layers of fleece, following the outline of your pattern. cut four more domes out, using a different fabric if you want a reversible hat. cut out any sets of trim, if included in the pattern, using the folded fabric to make a doubled up, folded piece. make sure you have all of your pieces. turn the fleece so that the back side of the fabric is facing out. stack a two pieces of fabric on top of each other and sew them together along half of the curve. repeat on the second, third and fourth domed tips to make darts. pin matching sets of fabric together at the top. sew the entire curved edge of your pined pieces, making two complete hats. keep the wrong side facing out. fold the long hem or trim pieces width-wise, good side touching good side, and sew them into large rings. match up the seam of your hem with the seam of your hat pieces, then pin them. sew all the way around the edges to attach the hem to the hat. match up the two smaller 'hats' and line them up by the longest seam. pin the two hats in place along the bottom edge and sew them, leaving a 2' space un-sewed. pull the fabric through your opening. tuck half of the beanie into the other, leaving you with a beautiful beanie.

"An option is a contract that gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy ('call') or sell ('put') a stock's index or future at a specific ('strike') price before a specified date in time ('expiry date'). Like a stock, an option is a security, meaning that it is a right to ownership of something else. However, unlike a stock, an option is a derivative, meaning that it derives its value from something else (usually a stock or stock index).The terms in parentheses are specific to options trading, and comprise a small part of the total number of terms in this unique language.;  , Options are a contract that confers the right to buy or sell something else to the buyer. The buyer (that's you) pays for this right and, hopefully, makes more off of the deal than you paid for the option. In other words, by buying the option you are not buying the underlying asset, but the right to buy or sell that asset at a given price.This concept can be complicated, but makes more sense when applied to everyday objects. For example, imagine that you find a used car that you want to purchase, but don't have the money for yet. You offer the salesman $1,000 for a contract that gives you the right to buy that car for $20,000 in two months (remember, this is a theoretical example). He agrees and you now have a 'call' option on the car.  At the end of that two months, you can either buy the car for the contract amount ($20,000) or decide not to buy the car and lose your $1,000.  Over the two months, the value of the asset being bought (the car) can also change. Imagine, for example, one case in which the car is discovered to be a prop from a famous movie. The value shoots up to $100,000. The salesman is now forced to sell you the car for $20,000, netting you an $80,000 profit, minus the $1000 contract cost, for a total of $79,000.  However, the value can also go down. Imagine over the course of the two months, a mechanic inspecting the car discovers massive structural damage. The value drops to $10,000. If you choose to still buy the car, you will lose $11,000 (including the contract value of $1,000) on the purchase. However, you are not obligated to purchase the car with an option.  'Put' and 'call' options are the two main types of options available to investors.  When you purchase a call, you are guaranteeing that you can buy a specific number of shares (usually 100 shares per contract) of the underlying security at a certain price by a certain date.A put guarantees you can sell a specific number of shares (again, usually 100) of the underlying security at a certain price by a certain date., Options offer flexibility, diversification, and a certain amount of protection against loss, and all for a fairly inexpensive cost.For instance, if stocks for a particular company are selling for $100 per share, you could buy 100 shares for $10,000. However, the option for that same company might be at eight points, and stocks are generally traded in blocks of 100, meaning the same amount of stock would cost you only $800!,, Options are available from almost all online brokerages and from brokers at large financial institutions. The best place to get started is with whoever handles your other investments. There are various types of specialized options trading software, but these platforms are often scams or just ineffective. Treat options as you would any other investment and handle them through your regular broker., Ask your broker or look around your online brokerage for a security, like a stock or exchange traded fund (ETF), that you want to buy an option on. Look at the asset's historical performance and then consider where it might be headed in the future. Do you think the price will increase or decrease? Study the security and make a prediction.  Check on your trading platform for options derived from your chosen security. These options will have strike prices either above the current price ('out of the money' for call options and 'in the money' for put options) of the security, below it ('in the money' for call options and 'out of the money' for put options), or at the same value ('at the money' for both call and put options).For example, an investor buys a call option to buy a security at a $40 strike price. If the security is currently trading at $45, the call option is in the money by $5.  The cost of an options contract, in other words the right to the option, is called the premium. This premium is charged by the seller of the option even if the buyer decides not to use the option. The premium is listed per share, while options contract are generally for 100 shares. For example, a premium might be listed as $0.25, but this would cost $25.00 (0.25*100) for the entire contract of 100 shares.  Premium prices fluctuate and are a based on a number of factors, including volatility, security price, and time value., Remember which way you think your security's price will move. Buy the appropriate option at the right strike price and time for you to make a profit. For example, imagine that you think that a security currently trading at $40 will be trading for $60 in three months. You see an option priced with a strike price at $45 in three months and a premium of $0.50. Obviously, if your stock performs even close to as well as you expect, you will see a sizable profit when you exercise the option.  If you purchased this option, you would pay a premium of $50 (100 shares *$0.50 per share).  Track the price of the security after you purchase an option on it. Look for signs that it may or may not move as expected. This doesn't mean that you should panic if it dips one day when you expect it to go up, but that if it begins to trend downward over several weeks or months you should reconsider your position.  You have three options when it comes to using your option. You can trade before maturity, trade at maturity, or decide not to use your option. Your choice will depend on the market price of the underlying security. These choices make sense in the following situations using the example option:The security, which was trading at $40 when you bought the option, has hovered around $40 in the two month since. You have another month left on your option, but don't think that the price will improve much in that time. You decide to trade before maturity and exercise the option on an up day at $42. This means that your profit is $2 per share (or $200) minus the $50 premium and any fees charged by your broker.  The security builds value steadily over the three months, arriving at $55 near the end of the contract term. You decide to trade at maturity by exercising your option just before maturity at the $55 dollar market price. This gives you $10 in profit per share (or $1000) minus the $50 premium and any broker fees.  Unforeseen circumstances pull the stock price down to $25 within the first month, where it remains through the end of the three months. You wisely decide not to exercise your option. This costs you your premium of $50.  Many people prefer to use index ETFs such as SPY or QQQ, since they are less volatile and will be more consistent.  This can be based off of informational analysis, like using charts and graphs provided by your broker, or on your analysis of market events (company profit reports, investor confidence, world events). If you are using graphical analysis, draw your support or resistance lines using your charting software. Use indicators (MACD, RSI, Stochastic, etc) to determine stock direction. In this example, the stock is headed lower due to a crossing in stochastics and a double top pattern.  A bear call spread will be placed above resistance. A bull put spread will be placed below support. The goal of the spread is for the stock to stay neutral or bearish (decreasing) when placing a bear call spread (BCS) or for the stock to stay neutral or bullish (increasing) when placing a bull put spread (BPS).  A spread above the current price is called a bear call spread (BCS for short). A spread below the price is called a bull put spread (BPS).  This should be above resistance for a BCS or below support for a BPS. In the above example, placing a BCS at $135/136 is perfect. If your stock has dollar options, it's advised to place more contracts with a smaller spread (10 contracts at $135 / 136) vs. buying fewer contracts with a larger spread (5 contracts at $135 / 137).  As a rule of thumb, your risk is your spread difference ($136-135) multiplied by 100. Then subtract your profit. For example, if you receive $30 for a $135/136 BCS, your risk is $100-30 = $70, and your ROI would be $30/$70 = 42%. Make sure your profit is enough to justify the risk. Additionally you can use probability calculators to see break-even points and danger zones. Stick with a certain probability of success, and don't break that just to get a better profit.  For example, for a BCS, sell the $135 call and buy the $136 call. For a BPS, sell a $120 put and buy the $119 put.  Follow the trade every day to see if the stock is going against you. If it stays still or goes in the desired direction, you have nothing to do: just let it expire. If it goes against you, you can buy back the sold option at a loss and let the bought option gain value, possibly breaking even or even making a small profit. Also feel free to close out the trade at any time if you've made a profit and want to keep it.  ","understand what an option is. learn how options work. learn the difference between puts and calls. compare the benefits of buying options rather than buying stocks. even if you lose money, you cannot lose more than the the premium, or price of the option.on the other hand, your potential for profit has no limit. find a broker if you don't already have one. find a security to buy an option for. look at available option prices for your chosen security. calculate the cost of the premium. purchase the right option. follow the price of the underlying security. decide what to do next. determine what security you want to trade, and predict which direction its price will move. find support for prediction. choose either a bear call spread or a bull put spread. determine the price at which to set your spread. calculate your profit/loss potential by using your brokerage's tools or by hand. place the spread by selling the option that's closer to the stock price and buying the next closest. set your stop-losses above the resistance or below the support.

"Children who watch more than 4 hours of television a day are more likely to be obese. This means that children are both susceptible to junk food ads and they are less active.  The American government has pressured advertisers not to advertise junk food during shows geared toward children who are 12 years old or younger. However, the pledge that these companies made does not extend to popular family television shows that air during the evening.  This is usually where the fresh food is located. In the inner aisles, there is candy and other foods that are packaged to appeal to children, with bright colors, cartoon characters and illustrations.  Have conversations with them so that they know why they do not eat advertised junk food. Teach them about the food groups and moderation of sugar and fat, so that they know how to make good food decisions despite the advertising.  This will limit the amount of time children spend looking at cereal boxes or other packaging that is aimed toward their demographic.  Many junk food companies are offering 'rewards' for people who buy a lot of their products. These sites encourage children to spend money on unhealthy purchases to receive gifts.

"Brown sugar tends to get hard due to air exposure. If you want to keep brown sugar soft, you're best option is to store your brown sugar in a sealable, airtight container as soon as you open it up.Limit air exposure as much as possible when storing brown sugar. Choose a smaller container and pack the brown sugar to the top. Make sure to seal tightly, double checking for cracks and openings.You may not find a small enough container. In this case, use a small Ziplock bag. Squeeze out all the excess air before sealing the bag.;  , Kitchen shops and some grocery stores sell what are called terra cotta sugar savers. These are small, circular devices made from terra cotta clay. They are inexpensive, about $3 each, and can be easily used to soften brown sugar. They are designed to release moisture into your sugar, keeping it soft in storage.  After purchasing the terra cotta sugar saver, soak it in water for 15 minutes. Then, dry off the disk.Store the sugar saver with the brown sugar. Ideally, you should be using the terra cotta sugar saver alongside a sealable airtight container or plastic bag.If you add a sugar saver to a bag of brown sugar that's already hardened, it may take up to 8 hours for the sugar to soften., If you don't have a sugar saver, marshmallows work for some when it comes to keeping sugar soft. Throw a few marshmallows into your sugar container and see if it helps., Apples and bread are both fairly moist by nature. Adding a few slices of apples or a piece of bread to a bag of brown sugar can help keep it soft. The idea is the sugar will draw moisture from the bread or fruit. If you're adding apples or bread to hardened brown sugar, it may take a day before it begins to soften.

"If you are forced to defend yourself against an ostrich, avoid close-quarters combat. Keep as far out of reach of its legs as you can. Use the nearest, longest object that could be used as a weapon, such as a pole, rake, broom, or branch.If you have a gun and need to use it, aim for the ostrich's main body to better ensure hitting your target. Although they will be attacking with their legs and/or beak, their legs and neck are very thin and easy to miss.  Consider yourself at the most risk when the two of you are face-to-face. Remember that an ostrich is only able to kick its legs directly in front of it. Stay behind or to the side of the bird as much as possible to keep clear of its most powerful weapon., Consider this to be the ostrich’s weakest body part. Strike it where it is most vulnerable and least protected to defeat it more quickly.Failing that, aim for its breast. Concentrate your efforts between the two as opportunity affords. Continue to strike until it quits and runs away., If the ostrich refuses to give up despite your attacks to its neck, aim for its wings when given the opportunity. Know that an ostrich uses its wings not for flight, but to alter course more smoothly when running, just like a ship’s rudder.Damaging its wings may marginally improve your chances of running away in a zigzag fashion if you are forced to retreat.

"You can write the scenes yourself or you can pull them from a book. You can even look up scripts online and re-act your favorite movies or shows. The best way to practice acting is to act, so grab a friend and work together to improve your skills.  YouTube has created a market for short, fun scenes or videos. Consider starting a short web series with a friend.  When possible, record your practice sessions, or have another friend watch and give advice on ways to improve.  If you want to be an actor, you need to study. Pay attention not just to the teacher but also other students. You can learn something from everyone, even if you don't agree with their acting decisions. Think about how you would play each role, and learn from your classmate's successes and shortcomings.  You may end up playing roles later on with your classmates, and you never know when someone will get their big break. Be kind and supportive to your classmates -- they will form your acting community as you grow.  Improvisation is a crucial skill, even if you never plan on doing improv comedy. This is because improv forces you to react to any situation, and stay in character. Acting is not just about delivering lines -- it is about inhabiting the character no matter what is happening on stage or on screen.If you don't want to pay for classes, you and several acting friends can look up improv games online. Use them to practice in your own home.  Don't box yourself into one type of role or genre. Not only does this make it harder to get jobs, but it limits your skill set and prevents further development as an actor. Anything that puts you in front of an audience, from movies, commercials, plays, and even stand-up, can help your practice your acting skills.  Paul Rudd started life as a wedding DJ before getting acting jobs, but used the time to learn to interface with a crowd.  Stand-up comedy is basically a one-person show, and you need to write and act out your material by yourself. This makes it an incredible practice opportunity.  Even if you want to be a movie actor, try to perform in a play. The dedicated time in one role and need for consistency is invaluable for any actor., Even if you're not acting, start making connections with people than can help you get on stage. Place yourself in jobs that connect you with directors, producers, and other actors, even if you start as a lowly PA. An old but true cliche is that 'people hire people.' It is not your resume or a faceless email that gets you the next big role. You need to be out in the world meeting people and getting your feet wet whenever you're not acting.

"As you begin working on combating your social networking addiction, you should first work to understand your social media usage. Take some time to review your posts from the past week or month. Write down how many things you posted in order to assess their frequency. Consider whether all the things you posted were necessary.  For instance, if you posted about a meal you had or about going to get a haircut, consider whether or not posting those things brought you or anyone else any joy or contentment.;  , If you are unsure of the extent of your addiction, you can determine how much time you spend by tracking your usage. Make a tick mark in a notebook each time you check a site. A more advanced and accurate way to determine usage, however, is to download an app designed to do so. Apps like QualityTime keep a count of how much time you spend on each social media site.Decide how much social media time seems reasonable; if you are exceeding that, it’s time to cut back.  Consider the times when others have constantly made comments to you about always being on social media. Think also of the times that you find yourself unable to keep up with your responsibilities. If you notice a pattern, then it is time to admit that you have a problem. Make a pact to commit to improving your situation. Remember that overcoming your denial and acknowledging your problem are the first steps.  Take a break from your social media for one hour and assess how you feel. If you feel jittery or nervous, you might have an addiction.  Sometimes a social media addiction might arise out of having little to do or out of a need for attention or connection with others. Take some time to write down your thoughts about this to explore the root of the problem.After assessing the roots, develop a plan to address it. If your issues stem from boredom, then find fun things to do offline.  For some, the desire to use social media constantly might feel beyond their own control. If you feel that you are unable to escape from the addiction, seek help from a therapist trained in that area. There are also support groups available for people struggling with the same or similar issues. It can be helpful to feel that you are not alone in your addiction and to discuss potential solutions for the problem.Remember that there is no stigma in seeking help.

"Most experienced travelers automatically base their travel plans off of their intentions and priorities for vacation: for example, experienced senior citizen travelers know they’re going abroad for some rest and relaxation, so they choose low-key destinations with plentiful amenities. Take a page from these seasoned ramblers and ask yourself what you want out of your first big destination. If you automatically think about relaxing on a beach, sipping margaritas, and getting spa treatments and massages, chances are you’re looking for some relaxation out of your vacation.  Cruises, resorts, and sea-side hotels are all great options for the traveler seeking respite. If you need help deciding what soothing option is your best one, consult a travel agent regarding the relative comfort and services offered at a variety of restful resorts and locations.Don’t forget to factor distance and travel time into your plans. You might have found the most relaxing island halfway across the world, but, if it requires a twenty-hour flight and multiple stopovers, you might not return home as rested and refreshed as you had hoped.  While popular travel shows such as Anthony Bourdain and Andrew Zimmern assume authentic cultural interaction is a priority, not all people really want this from their travel destinations. Travelers wanting to sunbathe by the Mediterranean or stroll around a cruise ship, for example, probably don’t want a dose of culture shock mixed into their relaxation remedy.  If you’re interested in the people, politics, or native arts scene, though, you should place cultural exposure high on your list of priorities. Cross off cruises, tourist resorts, guided excursions, and kitschy commercial districts such as Times Square in Manhattan or Puerto Vallarta in Mexico as viable options and look for more off-the-grid destinations.Remember that your history-heavy itinerary—especially if it’s guided by an agency or official group—probably won’t offer much genuine cross-cultural exchange. So, if this kind of exchange is important to you, make sure you carve out some independent time to roam the local markets or talk to some locals at a café.  Massive metropolises such as New York City, Mumbai, and Moscow offer plenty of options for physical activity—for example, urban hiking, indoor laser tag, and even urban bungee-jumping—but your access to the wilderness and associated activities such as camping, hiking, and fishing will be restricted. If daily activity, fresh air, and exposure to the wilderness are important to you, choose a rural destination with proximity to natural landmarks such as mountain ranges, lakes, rivers, forests, and canyons.  Since you’ll be traveling in a remote location while engaging in vigorous physical activity, you should take the risk of getting injured seriously. Have your doctor give you a thorough check-up before you embark to make sure you’re fit enough to handle the potential hazards of your travel adventure.Yearning for some natural landscapes doesn’t mean you have to forego the city experience entirely. Many smaller cities such as Belfast, Denver, and Lucerne are just minutes away from impressive landmarks and wild terrain which you can explore.  Depending on your age and your daily habits, you might think that eating, drinking, and dancing constitute an important part of traveling. If you’re excited about getting dressed up and going out on the town, consider choosing a major urban center or a mid-size town with a reputation for serious recreation and nightlife. If you plan on curling up by the fire with a book by 9 pm every night and rising early every morning, you might want to avoid big party destinations in order to avoid the crowds and noise attendant to these places.  Dubrovnik in Croatia, Amsterdam in the Netherlands, Bali in Indonesia, and Dubai in the United Arab Emirates are some of the most renowned international hot spots for late night—and all-day!—partying.  ","ask yourself if you’re going primarily to relax. consider how important authentic cultural experience and exposure is. decide if you want your travel to include physical adventure. take stock of your party priorities.

"Plain white vinegar is extremely acidic, which gives it antibacterial, antimicrobial, and antiseptic properties. Not only can it kill mold and mildew, it can also help loosen and lift other debris from your carpet. To make a cleaning solution, mix 2 cups (1/2 a liter) of warm water with a tablespoon of white vinegar and a teaspoon of baking soda in a spray bottle.Shake the mixture thoroughly and apply liberally to your carpet. Make more as needed.  Note that the room will smell strongly of vinegar until the mixture dries.  Once the mixture has dried, vacuum the room completely.  Mix 4 tablespoons of 3% hydrogen peroxide with a tablespoon of dye-free mild soap, such as Dr. Bronner’s. Blend them into roughly 1.5 quarts (about 1.5 liters) of hot water. This mixture is ideal for home carpet cleaning machines.Find 3% hydrogen peroxide at a pharmacy or grocery store.  Hydrogen peroxide risks lightening the color of darker carpets. As long as you keep the percentage of hydrogen peroxide below 3%, however, this risk is minimal.  Use white vinegar and hydrogen peroxide together for extra cleaning power. Blend a quarter cup of white vinegar with a tablespoon each of hydrogen peroxide and mild dye-free soap in a spray bottle. Fill the rest of the bottle with warm water., Especially when using hydrogen peroxide to clean your carpets, test your cleaning solution to ensure that you won’t accidentally cause discoloration. Simply wet a towel with your cleaning solution and rub it on the carpet in the corner of the closet, for instance.Let it sit for a few minutes, blot with a dry towel, and wait 24 hours. If no fading or other discoloration occurs, your mixture is likely safe to use on the rest of the carpet.

"Joint venture agreement violations take many forms and some are more severe than others. When you and your partner have created a joint venture corporation together, you have taken serious steps in your partnership. Just as corporations can be complex to form and maintain, they can also be difficult to dissolve (i.e., permanently end). Therefore, you should only dissolve the corporation when joint venture agreement violations are so egregious that you cannot work with your partner anymore.  For example, dissolution might be warranted if your partner continually fails to inject promised capital into the joint venture, if your partner goes bankrupt, or if your partner is using confidential information in a way that hurts your other business. In these examples, continuing to run a joint venture corporation may hurt your ability to run and maintain your other business. If this is the case, you should consider dissolving the joint venture corporation.;  , If you have assessed the violation and determined it is egregious enough to warrant dissolution, you will have to follow the dissolution guidelines established in your articles of incorporation. While every corporation will draft their guidelines differently, articles of incorporation generally require a vote to dissolve the corporation. Your guidelines may dictate that a dissolution vote can be taken by incorporators (i.e., you and your partner), elected board members, and/or shareholders.Depending on how your corporation and joint venture was set up, it may be difficult to obtain the required votes to dissolve because your partner will be responsible for up to 1/2 of the corporation. In anticipation of this problem, your articles of incorporation should include a provision allowing one partner to unilaterally dissolve when 'egregious violations' occur. To ensure this provision is not used improperly, you should explicitly define every 'egregious violation' that would allow this provision to become operational.  Once you have voted to dissolve in accordance with your articles of incorporation, you need to document this decision in a written agreement., Once you have officially voted to dissolve, you should hire experts to help you through the process. The dissolution process can be incredibly complex, especially if you have a lot of debt, assets, employees, and tax liabilities. It will be important to hire lawyers, accountants, business brokers, auctioneers, and tax experts.To hire these experts, first talk with your partner about the process. If the experts will be paid with corporate funds, you and your partner might need to agree no who to hire and how much to spend.  Start by talking with a mutually agreeable lawyer. If he or she is a qualified business lawyer, he or she will probably know other experts to reach out to.  If you fail to file dissolution documents with the secretary of state where your business was incorporated, you will continue to be liable for corporate taxes and annual filings.The process for filing dissolution documents will vary from state to state. For example, some states require you to file articles of dissolution (a.k.a., a certificate of dissolution) before notifying creditors while others require you to file after. In addition, some states will require 'tax clearance' (i.e., pay owed taxes) before you can file your dissolution papers.  You can usually find the required dissolution forms online. For example, in California, you can find the required filings on the secretary of state's website.Contact your secretary of state's office to determine the process where you incorporated., If you were required to obtain any permits or licenses in order to run your corporation, you will need to cancel those to avoid any further financial liability.To cancel existing licenses and permits, gather all of the valid ones and contact the agencies that issued them. All of your licenses and permits are usually required to be kept on hand, so they should be relatively easy to find.  For example, in California, most businesses need a business license, zoning approval, and a doing business as statement, to name a few. Most of these permits are issued by the particular city and county you are located in., If you have employees working for the joint venture corporation, you will need to pay them their final paychecks and provide them with adequate notice. Federal and state law will dictate when you have to notify employees and how they must be paid. For example, if you have 100 or more employees, you may have to provide at least 60 days notice before closing. In addition, you may have to pay employees for any unused vacation or leave time they have accumulated.Make sure you check with your lawyer and business experts to ensure you are complying with the law.  You will need to file final tax returns with both the federal government and your state government. When you file your taxes, make sure you check the boxes stating they are your final returns. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and your state tax agency will likely have a checklist available for you to follow. Apart from corporate tax filings, you may also have to make payroll tax filings if you have employees.  In addition, if you have an employer identification number (EIN), you need to cancel it with the IRS. Doing so will notify the IRS that you no longer plan on using it., Once your taxes have been paid, you need to notify lenders and creditors that you are dissolving your business. You should send a letter to each one explaining that you are dissolving your business, that claims need to be mailed to you within a certain period of time (usually 120 days), and that if you do not receive a timely claim it will be barred.Once the time period has ended, you need to review each claim and pay out any money owed.  If you do not have enough assets to pay every creditor, you may have to file for bankruptcy., In addition to paying out existing debts, you also need to collect any money that is owed to your business. Once your corporation is closed, you may be unable to retrieve it. Therefore, you need to draft request letters and send them to every person or entity that owes you money., Once all debts have been paid out and all money owed has been paid in, you can distribute the corporation's assets in accordance with your joint venture agreement. If all of the assets have been liquidated, you will be left with a pot of money to be distributed between you and your joint venture partner.  For example, assume that after all debts and taxes have been paid, the joint venture corporation is left with $500,000. In your joint venture agreement, you agreed that it would be split 60/40 between you and your partner. In this scenario, you would walk away with $300,000 and your partner would get $200,000.  Remember that distributions must be reported to the IRS on your personal tax returns., Even after your business closes, you may be required to keep certain documents for years. For example, tax and employment records may need to be kept for up to seven years after your business is dissolved.Make sure you check with the appropriate authorities and keep your business records for the required time period.  ","analyze the violation. vote to close the business. hire expert help. file dissolution documents with the state. cancel existing licenses and permits. comply with employment laws. pay taxes. notify creditors. recoup outstanding money owed to your corporation. distribute the remaining assets. maintain required records.

"This step is important.;  , This includes your: breath, body, clothes, shoes, bag, backpack, your purse and if you want to go even farther, spray a little perfume in your notebooks (if you go to school) that way, if someone wants to borrow a page or copy some notes, then it will smell like perfume, not like old books.  Use mirrors! Make sure you don't have anything in your teeth, anything around your mouth, sleep in your eyes, sloppy makeup, or dirt under your finger nails. Clean out your ears! People really do see the inside of your ears, even if you have long hair. Also clean the back of your neck and behind your ears.  Because no matter how clean you look if your clothes are dingy and you haven't washed your hair then you'll be a walking contradiction. You know? You won't look clean if you have greasy hair, if you have dry flakes in your hair, if you have rips or stains on your clothes, or if you have an excessive amount of dirt on your shoes.  Whiten your teeth, get those braces and brush 2 to 3 times a day. (use mouthwash and floss too.)Do whatever you have to do to feel confident in your smile. It's your most important asset as far as nonverbal communication goes. It shows when you're happy, angry, sad, scared, or even when you're in pain. Also.  Girl your eyes are truly the window to your soul. (but we'll get to the soul later on.) Wear makeup to play up your eye color and lengthen your eyelashes. Put Vaseline or Olive Oil on them at night to help them grow. The moisture will help them flourish. Another thing to play up your eyes is learning how to smile.  It's actually not always about the clothes! On my bum days (sweats and slippers baby) I'm most comfortable, and therefore the people around me are more comfortable with me too. But when I'm in my jeans, gym shoes, and t-shirt I am uncomfortable, ergo people are less comfortable around me. The moral of this story is, wear what you're comfortable with. If you love high heels but you're tripping over yourself then learn to love flats. So I don't really recommend doing a wardrobe overhaul.  Why? Because high pitched things irritate the ears. Squeaky voices aren't attractive and happen to be annoying so if you have a high pitched voice or have a tendency to have an overexcited voice then aim to lower the pitch. You don't have to sound like a surfer, just like a person with some gorgeous things to say.  Be comfortable in your own skin. Love yourself. There are many ways to say this but it all boils down to how you feel about yourself. You can only attract things/people that are like you. So if you have a low-self esteem you're going to attract people who are going to want to take advantage of you, or OTHER people who have a low self esteem, like you. So if you love yourself then what? Get it?  , Don't take too many things too seriously. And even if something does catch your attention and you want to acknowledge it then do that in private, but in front of other people just let it roll of your shoulder.  Have some type of flaw about you that you and others find attractive. For instance, if you snort when you laugh, only snort around your closest friends. Then when you find other people that you want to reveal that cute quirk to, then that will be something that you two can share.  Don't share too much too fast, with anyone! Not even your best friend. Practice in private so that you can shine in public, and be abnormally well prepared. Don't ever show off though. But if you're well prepared, then when the time is right, you'll be ready. Hone your skills and talents and evolve them as much as you can and be humble when you're praised for them. This will help you to become gorgeous on the inside too!  ,, Get into nature and savor that, but also recognize the good things in other people. To be gorgeous you have to know what gorgeous is. So if you see something that another girl or boy does that you think is cool, sexy etc. then don't hate on them. Make a mental note of that thing and add it to your own sexy arsenal.  ","have good hygiene. make sure you smell good. make sure that you are clean. make sure that look clean. smile. your eyes!, psst. pitch your voice low. be confident. have a sense of humor. be quirky. be mysterious. be a bit of a tease. , recognize and acknowledge the gorgeousness and sexiness around you.

"If your charger has frayed wires near the plug, it’s fairly simple to repair. Using scissors or a sharp blade, carefully cut away the plastic casing from the frayed end of the charger. Be careful not to cut any of the wires inside the casing., Using your scissors or blade, make a clean cut right through the frayed area., Strip away about an inch (if possible) of the protective rubber casing. This will expose the three wires inside the cable.  This will expose the metal filaments that make the wire. Make sure you don't sever these metal filaments while stripping the protective casing.  Do this on both ends.  Match the colors of the protective casing and twist the matching wires together.  Cover the exposed metal for each connection. This will prevent the exposed wires from touching each other and shorting the connection.  This will help keep the wires in place and secure.  You can find this tubing at electronic supply stores like Radio Shack, or use a rubber replacement.

"Scented cubes are small wax cubes with a powerful scent. Most large retailers carry scented cubes and there are hundreds to choose from. While most people place them on a warmer,causing them to melt and emit a smell, they can be used alongside candles.  Using a candle of your choosing, let it burn for several minutes or until about an inch-deep pool of melted wax has accumulated around the wick. Once this happens, place the scented wax cube into the melted wax. The flame will help the scented wax continue to melt down and emit a strong smell that will fill up the room.  Sense the wax cubes are so strong, consider cutting them in half using a butter knife.  The scented wax will melt to form a layer of wax. Every time you light this candle, the scented wax layer will continue to emit a smell for quite some time.  ","purchase scented cubes. light the candle. continue to enjoy. "
"The best cider has a balance between sweetness and tartness. Often times, apple producers (who will often make their own brand of cider) will blend different apples together to get the right combination. Finding 'your' blend is just a matter of experimentation, and experimenting will be a delicious endeavor! Here are some basic characteristics of common apple varieties:  Red Delicious: Large, firm red apple with a sweet flavor.  Yellow Delicious: Large, firm yellow apple with a sweet flavor.  Jonathon: Medium, crisp semi-tart apple, with red near the top, descending to green lower down the fruit.  Granny Smith: Medium/small, crisp, tart apple with green color.  Gala: Medium, crisp semi-tart apple with yellow skin blushed with orange to red tinge.;  , Shop the local produce stands, fruit markets or grocery store shelves. If you lean toward a sweet juice, use a ratio of three sweet to one tart, or for medium sweetness, use a 'two sweet to one tart' ratio. If you intend to make hard cider, use all sweet apples.  It takes about one third of a bushel to make one gallon of cider., Cutting out any bruises or damaged parts, and remove stems. As a rule, it is not recommended to use any fruit for cider that you would not eat as it is.  Leave the skins on them for the color, flavor, and nutrients that processing will release.  Use a food processor or blender, and process till your apples have the consistency of applesauce.  Squeeze the pureed apple through a cheesecloth, extracting all of the juice possible.  If you have a fine-mesh sieve or chinois, you can use the back of a spoon to press even more juice out.  After enjoying a tall glass of fresh apple cider, store the rest in a sealed container below 40 degrees Fahrenheit (5°C) for up to two weeks, or freeze for extended storage.  ","obtain the right apples. choose apples from the above list. clean the apples thoroughly. quarter the apples. puree the apple quarters. strain the pulp. always keep your cider refrigerated. "
"If your prawns were frozen, you’ll need to defrost them. Empty the prawns into a large bowl, preferably glass. Pour in some cold water and stir it around. Then drain the prawns and repeat this step several times. The entire process should take about fifteen minutes to fully defrost your prawns.Using the microwave to defrost prawns can make them soggy or overcooked.;  , Put the prawns in a colander and rinse them in the sink with cold water. Use your hands to rinse each prawn individually. As you are rinsing, keep an eye out for any spoiled prawns that are discolored or slimy. Prawns should appear white or gray before cooking.Never use water that is warmer than room temperature, as this could lead to soggy or rubbery prawns.  Prawns should ideally be cooked immediately after cleaning. However, if you must store them for later, be sure to keep them in the refrigerator for no more than 24 hours. After this length of time, they may start to go bad.  For the freshest, best tasting prawns, consider cleaning and cooking them as soon as you get home from the store.  Prawns need to be stored in a cool place like the refrigerator. They should be stored at a temperature between 32 °F (0 °C) and 38 °F (3 °C). Keep them together on a tray covered with plastic wrap or in a plastic container while they are in the fridge.You can also freeze prawns for up to three months in your freezer at −18 °C (0 °F), but this may lead to less fresh tasting prawns.  Prawns should never be left out at room temperature for more than a few minutes.  Hold the prawn by the body with one hand and use your other hand to firmly grasp the prawn’s head. Place the fingers from both hands at the intersection of the head and the body, where you want the break to occur. Pull back with both hands and twist until the head detaches.Discard the unused prawn heads in the trash immediately.  Hold the prawn by the body and grab the prawn tail with your other hand. Using a firm grip, pull the prawn tail off where it connects with the meaty part of the body. Throw away the tail once you remove it.Removing the tail before the rest of the shell will make the deshelling process much easier.  Once you have removed the shell, you should be able to peel off the remainder of the prawn’s outer layer quite easily. Use your fingers to pull the legs off from its underside. Then peel back any remaining pieces of the shell.This should leave you with just the meaty part of prawn left.  Use a sharp knife to cut a small line that runs down the length of the prawn’s back. This should be done on the top of the prawn, the opposite side from where the legs were. Inside, you will see a small black line. Use the tip of the knife to pull out the vein and discard it.This black vein is the prawn’s intestines. Removing it will help your prawns taste much better.  After deveining the prawns, you should rinse them once more with cold water. This will help ensure all remnants of the intestines are completely removed.  It may seem more convenient to choose prawns that have already been cooked or deshelled, but this will yield a great sacrifice in taste. Prawns taste best after the first time they are cooked, so it is important to purchase raw prawns.Removing the shell gets rid of all the oils on the prawn, so choose prawns that have not been deshelled to help maintain the full flavor.  Prawns should be purchased fresh and stored on a bed of ice in the meat section of your market or grocery store. This allows you to inspect them for discoloration and smell, and you will be able to choose the best ones.Buying prepackaged prawns means you will get prawns that are much older and will not taste nearly as good.  Prawns should be white or grayish in color with only white meat. Inspect each prawn for spots or areas of discoloration that indicate spoilage. Only choose prawns that are light in color and have no darker spots on them.There are also brown varieties of prawns that should appear brown in color. These, too, should have no spots or discolored areas.  While all seafood smells slightly fishy, prawns should not be too odorous. If there is a strong fishy smell to them, that means they are probably going bad. Choose prawns that smell fresh and clean, with only a hint of that seafood smell.This is another reason you should only purchase fresh prawns instead of prepackaged ones. If they are wrapped up in packing, you won’t be able to check out how the prawns smell before you purchase them.  ","defrost the prawns. rinse the prawns in cold water. cook the prawns soon after cleaning. store the cleaned prawns in the refrigerator. remove the prawn head. pull off the tail. peel off the shell and legs. devein the prawn. choose uncooked prawns with the shell still on. purchase prawns on ice. look at the color. notice the smell.

"While olive oil is almost always perfectly safe for healthy people, certain injuries and conditions can make your ears too sensitive for it. If you have any of the following problems, speak to your doctor before taking any action.Perforated eardrums  Frequent ear infections  Hearing loss in either ear  Mastoid cavity  Any condition for which you've been told to keep your ears dry;  , Olive oil helps soften the wax in your ears, making it easier to drain on its own.Before putting any of the oil into your ears, however, you should warm it roughly to body temperature—98.6°F. This is the temperature of your inner ear, and the oil will be more comfortable at a comparable temperature. You should warm two to three tablespoons of pure olive oil.  Ensure you don’t overheat the oil since this can cause damage to your eardrum.  Note that while olive oil is a common option, it’s not the only option. You can also safely use hydrogen peroxide, glycerin, baby oil, or mineral oil., Blockages can also trap bacteria, which can lead to infection of the ear.Some people choose to add essential oils with antibacterial properties to help with excess bacteria that may be present due to the blockage. However, the olive oil alone has shown to be effective in simply helping to break up the blockage.Make sure to test a drop or two of the oil on your skin to check for irritation before adding it to your ears. Add about four drops to the warmed olive oil. Some essential oil options include:  Garlic oilEucalyptus oilLavender oil, which is safe for childrenOregano oilSt. John’s wort, Once you’ve mixed the olive oil and any essential oils you’ve chosen, pick up some of the solution with an eyedropper.This will help you deliver the correct amount of the solution, and it’s much easier than trying to pour olive oil into your ear.  Rather than filling your ear with the oil, you can apply just a few drops, which will soak into the wax.Keep your head titled to stop the oil from escaping for five to ten minutes.  You can keep a tissue next to your ear to catch any remaining oil that drips out when you straighten your head—if any.  Using the olive oil isn’t likely to work in a single application. You should try to repeat the process two to three times each day for approximately three to five days.This should be sufficient time to help dissolve and break up the blockage.  Though the olive oil may have softened the blockage, some cases require more to actually dislodge it. You can irrigate the affected ear as an additional step if necessary. Use a rubber-bulb syringe (such as those used for babies), tilt your head, and gently squirt warmed water into the canal of the affected ear.Be very gentle since you can damage your eardrum if you squirt the water with too much pressure.  You can pull your ear both up and backward to help straighten the ear canal for best results.Your doctor can also irrigate your ear. He or she will have a safer method with tools using an exact pressure of water to avoid damaging your ear., If the process of softening the blockage and irrigating your ear doesn’t help, then consider seeing your doctor. He or she will have several methods available to safely remove the blockage.Your doctor will also be able to exam your ear and form a proper diagnosis. Your problem may not have been an earwax blockage in the first place. Other causes of a congested sensation in your ears include:Sinusitis - inflammation of the sinuses  Meniere’s Disease - an inner ear disorder with hearing and balance problems  Cholesteatoma - a cyst in the middle ear  Acoustic neuroma - a tumor of the acoustic (hearing) nerve  Fungal infections  Serous otitis media - a middle ear infection  Temporomandibular junction (TMJ) dysfunction  ","do not use olive oil if you have another ear injury. warm up the olive oil. add essential oils if you wish. collect some of the mix with an eyedropper. squeeze two drops of the solution into your ear. repeat the process two to three times a day. consider irrigating your ear. see your doctor.

"Pick a color as close to your natural hair color as possible.  Don’t pick a color that is darker than your eyebrows. Go a little lighter than your natural color if you can’t find a matching shade.

If you are forming a company, you will need a name. Think of something distinctive that describes the services you are offering. Search for your company's name in the Department of State Business Registry under 'Corporate Name Availability' to make sure nobody else has used it. Every state maintains its own list of business names and the departments that control these lists go by different names. The state Secretary is often in charge of managing this list. Once you know your name is original, register it with the appropriate department.Register through the Department of State Website, or mail in your form to the address they give.  Comply with legal requirements for your business structure. If you form an LLC, for example, you may be required to include the abbreviation 'LLC' in your company's name. , If you want your company to have employees, or sell goods and collect sales tax, you’ll need to register with the Department of Revenue.Go to your state's Department of Revenue and register there.  If you are the only member of your new business, and will not collect sales tax, you will pay self-employment tax instead.  If you open an unincorporated business alone, you are a sole proprietor. Sole proprietors are responsible for paying the entirety of their company's taxes, but reap the entirety of profits earned. Consider founding a sole proprietorship if you would like to answer only to yourself and can personally afford financial setbacks.Sole proprietors are not the same as sole members. If you are the sole member of a domestic limited liability company (LLC), but choose to classify the LLC as a corporation, you are not a sole proprietor.  If you would like to share gains, losses, responsibilities and labor with one or more people, consider a partnership. Like a sole proprietorship, owners of a partnership pay individual taxes. If you would like to be your own boss but be responsible to an equal, a partnership is an excellent model.Employees do not count as partners, or vice versa.  An LLC combines many of the advantages of sole proprietorships/partnerships and corporations for its owners. If you own an LLC, you are considered a 'member.' Most states allow single-member LLCs, as well as partnerships. If you form an LLC, you will be protected from personal liability for business debts as if you were corporation.Additionally, you will not be required to pay corporate taxes. LLC owners pay personal taxes, much like owners of partnerships and sole proprietorships., An LLC (limited liability corporation) is cheaper to run, but there are also reasons to incorporate. For example, you may choose to form a corporation if you want to be able to offer stock options.This can help you attract investors and highly skilled employees. Corporations are taxed at a lower rate than individuals, so you can save money on a highly profitable business by keeping profits inside the business.However, profits in a corporation are taxed at a corporate level, then the profits are taxed again at a personal level when they are distributed to owners in the form of dividends. Therefore, the actual taxes might be greater than they would be if paid on a pass through basis.  If you are an independent contractor and your clients want you to be incorporated so that you do not show up in their tax records as an employee, you might choose to incorporate., If you form an S corporation, you pass financial gains, losses, deductions and credits to your shareholders. You and your shareholders will be taxed as individuals, and your corporation will not be taxed.  To qualify as an S corporation, the company you form must be domestic, have no more than 100 shareholders, and have only one class of stock. Other restrictions may apply., Request an EIN if your company has more than one owner or member, if you plan to hire any employees, or if you choose to be taxed as a corporation rather than an independent contractor or sole proprietorship. Get your EIN through the IRS website. Your EIN is free., Self-employed people must pay quarterly estimated taxes throughout the year. Failure to pay your estimated taxes so may result in a penalty. To pay quarterly estimated taxes, fill out form 1040 ES: Due dates for estimated taxes are April 15th, June 15th, September 15th, and January 15th.If you are an independent contractor, the companies you work for will send you a 1099-MISC instead of a W2. You must still pay quarterly estimated taxes.  Keep a separate bank account for your work, and track any expenses related to it (cell phone, gas money, website maintenance).If you work from home, you may qualify for a home office deduction.You can get a deduction for anything you spend money on for business that is 'ordinary and necessary.'

"Cigarette and tobacco smoke contains harmful substances known as carcinogens that can damage the cells lining your lungs. Over time, smoking can lead to the development and multiplication of abnormal cells and increase your risk for lung cancer.Contact your healthcare provider for help with smoking cessation programs if you experience difficulty with quitting smoking. Your physician may prescribe medications that can help you quit smoking, suggest that you join a smoking cessation support group, or recommend nicotine patches and gums that can help you kick your habit.;  , Non-smokers exposed to secondhand smoke inhale the same carcinogens and cancer-causing substances as actual smokers. Avoid spending time around people who smoke, and avoid spending time at venues such as bars and restaurants that allow smoking.  Radon is a radioactive gas released during the natural decay process of elements such as uranium, thorium, and radium -- all of which are commonly found in rocks and soil. When inhaled, the radioactive particles in radon can damage the cells lining your lungs and increase the risk for lung cancer. Purchase a radon-testing kit for your home, or contact a local radon-detection specialist who can inspect your home for signs of radon., Substances and chemicals such as asbestos, formaldehyde, benzene, and arsenic are all types of carcinogens that have been found to cause lung cancer. If you spend time working with carcinogens, follow the necessary precautions to lower your exposure to these substances. Wear protective gear such as a face mask, goggles, pants, long-sleeved shirts, and jackets.  Exercise improves overall lung function by increasing blood flow to the lungs and helping eliminate waste from your body, including toxins from cigarette smoke, carcinogens, and other free radicals that increase your risk for lung cancer. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that adults engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activities per week (brisk walking, swimming, cycling), and strength-training exercises at least twice per week that work some or all of your major muscle groups.  Natural whole foods such as fruits and vegetables are packed with vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that can help prevent lung cancer by strengthening your immune system. Lower your intake of processed foods and foods high in fat and sugar, and consume more fruits and vegetables. Increasing your intake of other natural whole foods such as nuts, seeds, legumes, sources of lean protein, and healthy fats can also help reduce your risk for lung cancer., Long-term exposure to air pollution from motor vehicles, factories, and other sources have been shown to increase the risk for lung cancer. If possible, avoid walking or running next to busy roads, and spend less time outdoors in environments with heavy air pollution.  Lung diseases such as tuberculosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease can increase your risk for lung cancer. If you suffer from these types of lung diseases, work with your healthcare provider to have these diseases treated as soon as possible in an effort to prevent the development of lung cancer.  ","stop smoking tobacco products. limit your exposure to secondhand smoke. have your home tested for radon. avoid exposure to carcinogens at the workplace. exercise on a regular basis. consume a higher amount of fruits and vegetables. reduce your exposure to outdoor air pollution as much as possible. seek treatment for lung diseases independent of lung cancer.

"Typically there are some things that cause you to feel more anxious than others. Some common triggers of social anxiety include:Meeting new people  Going on a date  Public speaking  Taking exams  Using public restrooms  Parties or eating in public  , Once you identify the trigger, try to do these things more often. The more that you do anxiety-provoking activities, the better you will get at them. Consequently, you will begin to experience less anxiety.  For example, if meeting new people is anxiety-provoking for you, practice saying hello first or be intentional about making eye contact when speaking to other people.Try speaking to three people each time you go to the grocery store.  Although you can avoid some anxiety-provoking situations, it’s probably not the best idea in the long run. In fact, avoidance can make your fear worsen over time.Instead, try facing your fears one step at a time.  If you know that a particular situation may trigger your anxiety, try preparing for it in advance. For example, you could read the newspaper in advance to discover conversation starters before going on an outing with other people. Or maybe you could practice going to dinner with a family member or friend before going on a date., A great way to conquer your fears is to participate in more social activities.Here are some great ways to interact with others in a more positive way:Volunteer for a cause that you’re passionate about.  Go to places where you have to use your social skills, such as a restaurant. You could also take a social skills workshop. Community colleges may conduct these types of workshops.  Take an assertiveness class.

",,  The current position knob can be dragged to jump to any position in the video.  When you mouse-over the slide-bar, the current time indicator will be displayed at your mouse cursor.  Layers/Tracks are where you will be adding your 'Events' or objects such as text and hyperlinks.  Layers are like transparent placeholders for your events/objects. They have a stack-like structure where the topmost layer will have the most priority in displaying. That is to say, events in the top most layer will hide any events from layers that are 'below' it and that overlap with the event (occupy the same space on the screen).  Each layer is displayed as a box in the Pane.  Each layer has a handle from which you can drag and drop the layer to change its position relative to other layers.  When you mouse-over a layer's name, the 'Delete Layer' button appears. You can use that to delete a layer/track.  You can use the 'Add a new track for your events' button to add extra layers/tracks.  This is where you'll drop your events and decide when they will be displayed when they will fade away.  Drop an event into one of the tracks/layers to add an event to that track.  Use the re-size handles that appear on the sides of an event to stretch it or shrink it.  Stretching/shrinking to the left makes the event start earlier/later. It changes the time the event starts.  Stretching/shrinking to the right makes the event end later. It changes the time the event ends.  The timeline zoom slide-bar is used to zoom in and out of the timeline. This affects how much of the real timeline is displayed in the timeline selector bar. When zoomed out to the maximum level, the selector bar represents the whole timeline of the video. All events are minimized/zoomed out to fit in the selector bar. When zoomed in, the selector will only represent a portion of the actual timeline. You'll have to scroll left or right to see the rest of the timeline.  The timeline selector represents a portion of or the whole timeline. It is used to select which portion of the represented timeline is displayed in the tracks timeline pane.  You can adjust the 'window' that selects the portion of the timeline to be displayed by resizing it using the handles to its right and left.  Events are objects you can add to the video.

Juice lacks fiber and can't provide all the benefits of whole produce, so don't replace your eating with drinking.  Get protein every day. If you're a vegan or a vegetarian, make sure you get adequate amounts of protein-rich foods like rice and beans, hummus, tofu, and nuts.  Eat whole-grain carbohydrates for energy and minerals.Yogurt, cheese, cottage cheese, and milk are delicious and provide essential calcium.;  , Homemade food is almost always lower in calories than frozen or prepared food. Tell your parents you want to pack your own lunches. If your parents buy a lot of take-out, ask them if you can all start taking turns making dinner several nights a week.  Your parents are going to worry if they think you're starving yourself. They're less likely to worry if they can see that you are eating well and getting interested in food preparation.  Skipping meals will make you gain weight. Make sure you eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner, with some healthy snacks in between.You will overeat if you get too hungry. Try keeping a few snack bars, nuts, apples, and other filling snacks in your locker or backpack so that you can eat when you're hungry.  Make sure you get breakfast! Skipping breakfast will make you hungry and low-energy. It may even lead to weight gain., Don't consume these things every day, but don't eliminate things you like completely. Treat sugary drinks and snacks as treats. Consume them as a special occasion. If you get out of the habit of eating sugar all the time, you won't crave it as much.  Alcohol is very high in sugar, and it's best to avoid it if you're trying to lose weight., If you eat when you are stressed or distracted, you might eat too much or eat the wrong things. Try paying attention when you eat. Eat slowly so that you notice yourself filling up. Start eating when you're hungry, and stop eating when you're full.  Try tasting every bite you take.  Eat with your family. Eating with people you like can help you eat the right way.  Most restaurants will serve you more than you need to feel full., Dieting can actually make you gain weight. Most diets will cause you to lose weight at first, then gain it all back. The best way to have a healthy weight is to eat a healthy diet, get ordinary amounts of physical activity, and feel fine about your body and your habits.Avoid any crash diets that claim you can lose a lot of weight at once.  Never take laxatives, skip meals, vomit, or take weight loss pills to lose weight., It's hard to calculate your own correct weight, because everyone's healthy weight is different. You can calculate your BMI, which is how you find out if your weight is correct for your height, but the BMI fails to factor in things like your genes and your growth.You can talk to your doctor during an ordinary doctor's appointment.  Talk to your pediatrician, who has a record of your weight over your whole childhood, and ask if you are an ordinary weight for your age.  You might also ask: 'I'd like to lose weight.

Get into a regular exercise routine so that you get fit and stay fit. Aim for an hour of physical exercise a day.Consider trying out for a team sport, like swim team or volleyball.  If you're not competitive or don't like teams, try solo exercise like biking, jogging, skateboarding, or walking.  Get an exercise buddy. If you have a friend who enjoys exercise, ask if they'll go on hikes with you, or join a dance class and learn ballroom dancing or contradance.

This will make it hard for you to control your weight later on.Avoid compulsive exercise. This is when you feel like you can't control your own urge to exercise—you must exercise, or you can't relax. This is a warning sign that you may be developing an eating disorder.  Getting a healthy amount of sleep every night will help you regulate your weight.If you're a teenager, aim for 9-11 hours of sleep a night.Naps can't make up for lost sleep, so try to go to bed at a reasonable time every night.  If you sleep fewer than 9 hours a night, try adding hours on. You'll lose weight for every hour you add (up to 11—after that, you'll just confuse your body).  To get enough sleep, get into a good sleep routine. Go to bed at the same time every night if you can, and do relaxing things before sleep, such as reading, chatting with family, or watching a comedy.  Being on your device can cause you to zone out and lose track of time.

You'll scare your parents if you start eating less or exercising too much, and you'll scare them if you aren't honest with them about your diet and your worries. If you are trying to lose weight without your parents knowing, ask yourself why. If you're really doing something harmless, why is it a secret?  If the issue is that your parents are controlling, speak to a trusted adult.  If the issue is that you have an eating disorder, you can speak to your school nurse or your doctor.  Diets work better with family support.  If you're trying to lose weight without your parents knowing, you might have an eating disorder. Ask yourself: do I think about food all the time?

"Federal law requires that you be paid 1.5 times your base pay for each hour worked over 40 hours in a week.You should first calculate your base rate of pay. For example, if you are paid $12.00 an hour, then this is your regular rate of pay.  If you are paid a salary, then you need to divide your salary by 40 hours in order to get a regular rate of pay.  Under federal law, a worker with a base pay of $12.00 will earn $18.00 in overtime pay.;  , States can also pass their own overtime laws provided the state law is more generous to workers than the federal law. In California, for example, you can get overtime pay if you work more than eight hours in a day. If you work more than 12 in a day, then you get double pay.For example, if you work 10 hours in a day, then you must be paid overtime for the two extra hours on that day, even if you work 40 hours or less for the entire week.  California also grants overtime pay if you work seven consecutive days. On the seventh day, you earn 1.5 your regular rate of pay. If you work more than eight hours on the seventh day, then you earn double the pay.  To find your state’s overtime rules, you should contact your state’s Department of Labor. You can find contact information on the Internet.  Before you can choose between comp time and overtime pay, you should calculate how much you will be paid if you work overtime. For example, if your regular rate of pay is $12.00, then you will earn $18.00 for every hour of overtime.  If you worked 50 hours in a week, then you would earn $480.00 in regular pay and then an additional $180.00 in overtime pay. Your total paycheck would be $660.00.  Each state has an agency that handles wage and hour issues. It is usually the Department of Labor. You can direct any questions you have about how overtime pay is calculated to the agency.  To find your state agency, you can visit the Workplace Fairness website. They have a map of the United States.Click on your state, and you will be provided with the name and contact information of your state’s agency.  It is a common misconception that you will earn one comp time hour for each extra hour worked in a week.However, federal law mandates that you be given 1.5 hours in compensatory time for each extra hour worked in a week unless you are exempt from the federal overtime laws.Before you can choose between overtime pay and comp time, you should understand how the comp time is calculated. Look at your employee manuals, which should explain the formula. If nothing is listed in the manual or in your employment contract, then contact Human Resources.  If you are unionized, then read your collective bargaining agreement. This agreement should spell out how compensatory time is calculated.  Your employer might try to put limits on when you can take your extra time off. You should know this before choosing between comp time and overtime pay. You don’t want to choose comp time based on a false belief that you can take the time whenever you want.  You can ask your supervisor about the policy on taking comp time. However, you should also check with coworkers, who are more likely to be honest with you. If you are new to a workplace, then ask other people in comparable positions if they have had a problem taking time off.  If you have been with the organization for some time, then think about how difficult it has been to get vacation days off. An employer who tries to limit your use of vacation or personal days is unlikely to let you take comp time.  Your employer may also decide to send you home when work is slow. To get paid, you would then use your comp time.This might not be an ideal situation for you because you do not control when you take your comp time. You should ask your employer whether this is a possibility.  You should understand the policies for “cashing out” accrued comp time. For example, you might want to accrue comp time during the year and then decide at year’s end whether to cash out the comp time.  If your employer is flexible about cashing out comp time, then it is a more attractive option than overtime, since you can’t convert overtime pay into extra time off from work.  You might be limited in the maximum number of comp time hours you can accrue. You should know this fact as well. For example, federal law generally limits the maximum number of comp hours to 240.State law and workplace policies might also limit the total amount of comp hours you can carry at any one time.  If you work in a seasonal, emergency response, or public safety activity, then you can accrue up to 480 hours under the federal law., If you are given the choice between comp time and overtime pay, you should consider which you need more: extra money or extra time off. This may or may not be an easy choice.  Think about any major expenses you have on the horizon: home repairs, health care costs, trips for vacation, etc. Check if you have the money to cover the costs. If not, you might want to take overtime over comp time.  Also consider demands on your time. You might need time off to take care of a sick relative, take an extended vacation, recover from surgery, or finish education requirements. If you can’t easily fit these demands into your schedule, then you might decide that comp time is more important than overtime pay.  Be sure to discuss your decision with friends and family. You should get feedback from the people closest to you about whether or not you should take compensatory time or overtime. Your children, for example, can let you know about upcoming events that you might want to attend.  You might not care whether or not you take overtime or comp time; nevertheless, your employer might have a strong preference for one over the other. Sometimes, employers are worried about paying too much in salary and would prefer that their employees take comp time.  You should consider how important it is to keep your employer happy. If you are new at a job or do not want to make waves for any reason, then you should try to take whichever your employer prefers. You can ask your boss if he or she has a preference for whether or not you accept overtime or comp time.  Your income tax is based on the income that you earn in a year.This includes your overtime pay. Before accepting overtime pay, you need to calculate how the extra pay will impact your taxes.  You should meet with a tax professional to discuss the consequences of taking overtime pay. To find a qualified tax professional, see Hire an Accountant.  ","calculate your regular rate of pay. find your state overtime laws. estimate how much overtime you would earn. call your state agency with questions. figure out how comp time is calculated. ask if you can take comp time whenever you want. ask about “cashing out” comp time. check the maximum number of hours you can accrue. determine how much money you need. figure out if your employer has a preference. understand the tax consequences.

"You can do a spinal stretch on the floor, or while sitting in bed before you even get up in the morning. This yoga pose will help you wake up and give you steady energy throughout the day.Sit cross-legged and gently press down on your knees, lengthening and stabilizing your spine. If you need cushioning, sit on a pillow or a folded blanket. As you inhale, reach your left hand over to your right knee. Lift from the crown of your head and breathe, lengthening your spine.  As you exhale, twist your torso to the right. You can hold this stretch for several breaths, focusing on lifting with every inhale and twisting more deeply with every exhale. Release to center and then repeat the twist in the other direction.  Cats spend a lot of their time sleeping, so it stands to reason they would understand how important it is to stretch after a long period of inactivity to keep your muscles loose and maintain flexibility and agility.One way to give your back and core a good stretch is to do the yoga pose known as the cat tilt. Get on your hands and knees, with your wrists directly below your shoulders and your knees directly below your hips.  On an exhale, round your back upward, pulling your chin toward your navel. Then inhale and arch your back, lifting as you arch your back. On exhale, round your back again. Repeat the entire sequence three to five times.  Puppies sleep just as often as cats do, and these yoga poses will help you stretch like a puppy does to maintain and increase your mobility, as well as decreasing the stiffness in your muscles after a long night's sleep.On all fours as you were for the cat tilt, press your fingers and palms firmly into the floor and lift your hips toward the ceiling, rising to your toes. Keep your knees bent and shake a little, then straighten one leg behind you, reaching your heel towards the floor.  Complete a breath, then bring your legs back together and extend the other leg using the same process.  You also can add downward facing dog here. From the same position, simply reach upward with your hips, lengthening your back. Keep your heels raised off the floor, but push through them, as though trying to lower them to the floor.  ","start with a spinal stretch. stretch like a cat. move into puppy pose. "
"You have to buy something that you can stitch together, but otherwise it’s totally up to you. Use a left over pillowcase or even the old drapes.  There are a couple ways to get a template for your hand puppet. You can buy them at crafts stores, download them online, or make them yourself.  If you want to make a basic hand puppet yourself, put your hand palm down on your piece of fabric. Now draw small dots on the fabric on either side of your hand to designate the width. This is how wide you’ll want the body of your template to be.  Once you’ve done that, you can start drawing the outline of your puppet. If you want your puppet to have arms remember that your thumb and pinky will be controlling the arms. Put your hand back down on the fabric and designate where your thumb and pinky emerge from your hand. This is where you’ll want the arms to begin.  Make sure you leave room for your fingers in the head of the puppet as well. Your index, middle, and ring finger will need to rest in there, so ensure that it is wide enough for those three fingers to fit inside.  Otherwise, the drawing is up to you! Using the width of your hand as your guide make two straight parallel lines. Now round these lines off away from each other diagonally to create the arms. Try to keep them the same length. Keep in mind that they should be pretty short. Once you’ve completed the full outline of the arms draw a wide half circle for the head. Add ears, horns, or whatever else you would like to the outline.  Put the fabric that you drew or traced your template onto on top of the second piece of fabric.  , Try not to cut so much that your hand will not fit in there. Make sure that the two pieces of fabric are lined up well. Once you start cutting make sure that you don't move the two pieces of fabric away from each other at all. If you're worried you can trace your template onto a piece of paper first and then cut one piece of fabric at a time.  Sew around the outline of your cut out fabric. Make sure you leave a hole at the bottom so you can put your hand in there.  You can add string for eyes and a mouth, different colored fabric to give your puppets spots, or anything else you can think of. If you sew on another piece of fabric to your puppet make sure you only sew through one layer of your puppet fabric. Otherwise it will be stuck together.  ","buy felt, cloth, or whatever other fabric material you would like to use to make your hand puppet. make your template. place two pieces of fabric on top of each other. cut the template out of both pieces of fabric. sew the two pieces of fabric together. embroider your puppet.

"If you notice any indication of skin problems, take your cat to the vet for a proper diagnosis. Your vet will be able determine the cause of your cat’s skin problems and provide a remedy.Your vet will first initiate a visual examination to check for fleas and examine the area of irritation.  If they don’t immediately find something, they will take a biopsy (a skin scraping) to check for mites and infections.  Your vet might also use a fungal culture to check for ringworm. This involves testing your cat’s nail clippings, fur, or body fluids for presence of the fungus that the vet suspects caused your cat’s skin problems.  If the visual examination, biopsy, and fungal culture fail to identify anything out of the ordinary, your vet might take a blood sample from your cat. The process is not unlike that which you experience when getting blood drawn at the doctor’s office. Your vet will simply use a needle to puncture the skin and draw blood from your cat.Your vet might ask you or an assistant to reassure or restrain the cat when drawing its blood.  Blood tests might reveal allergies that could be the underlying cause of your cat’s skin problems.  When you bring your cat to a vet for diagnosis, let them know of any recent significant changes to your cat’s lifestyle. For instance, if you recently changed your cat’s cat food or moved to a new home, share that information with your vet.Let your vet know if other cats or house pets are suffering from a similar skin condition. Whatever your cat has might be contagious.The more information about your cat you share with your vet, the better they will be able to diagnose the situation.  Your vet will recommend an appropriate solution based on their analysis of your cat’s skin problem. For instance, you might need to apply anti-inflammatory medications or antihistamines (medications that control the immune system). Antibiotics or antifungal treatments might be necessary in the case of an infection. Non-medical solutions could include creams, ear drops, or a simple haircut for your feline friend.Always use medications as directed.  Contact your vet if you have questions regarding treatment.  ","take your cat to the vet. get a blood test. share information about your cat’s lifestyle. follow the vet’s treatment recommendations. "

"Some hairstyles are much harder on the hair and scalp than others, because they pull and can cause breakage. Cornrows, braids, ponytails, top-knots, or buns can all do this, especially if they are worn continuously or too tightly.Choose a style that doesn’t pull or put tension on the shafts of your hair. Too tight ponytails and others can cause traction alopecia on the sides of your head; braids around the hairline can easily cause damage the hair there.  If you really like your hair up, at least give it frequent rests. Pick a style that you can let down at the end of the day.;  , Hair “enhancements” like weaves and extensions can make your hair fuller and longer in the short term. However, they can also pull at the hair fibers and roots and, over time, contribute to hair loss. Sometimes, this damage is permanent.Prolonged pulling of the roots can cause inflammation and lead to scarring, which may permanently destroy them.  Only get weaves and extensions at salons that specialize in such products, and make sure that they are light-weight.  Don’t wear weaves or extensions for more than 2 or 3 months at most. Keep up your normal scalp hygiene and switch hair styles periodically.  Rest your hair for a few weeks in between hair extension applications., The thing about these products is that they coat the hair and add friction when you comb or brush, all of which increases the risk of breakage.Styling your hair after using a hold product can lead to hair loss over time. Choose an everyday style that doesn’t need styling product, instead, if possible.  Do you color, perm, straighten, or bleach your hair? All of these procedures involve chemicals that erode the integrity of hair fibers and can eventually make your hair dull looking or frizzy or even break off, thinning your hair.Most people should wait 6 to 7 weeks between hair coloring or, in the winter, 8 to 10 weeks. Those with naturally strong hair may be able to go every five weeks. For a perm, wait at least 1 to 2 weeks before repeating.Only have one treatment at a time. If you have a perm, for example, wait at least 2 weeks before coloring your hair.  Make sure to do deep conditioning on your hair every few days to help it recover from these chemical processes.  Traction alopecia can be prevented, especially if you recognize it early on. If you think that your hairstyles might be damaging your hair, look out for the following signs:A sense of relief when you untie your hair  Tenderness of your scalp  An itchy scalp  The need to take painkillers because of a headache caused by your hairstyle  , Overheating hair can cause it to become brittle or to crack, split, and break off. It can also strip the hair of moisture, making it dull. You’ll want to avoid over-using heating tools to prevent hair loss, but especially blow dryers and irons.Don’t apply the blow dryer directly to your hair. Direct heat can burn or weaken hair. Limit your use of blow dryers each week, as well.  Flat irons and curlers can also damage your hair with heat. Limit your use of them to no more than every other day. Leave irons in place only for a second or two.Never use a tool like this on wet hair, because it can easily burn it. Use irons on dry hair at a low or medium setting.  To avoid the harsh effect of a blow dryer, consider wrapping your head in a towel “turban” to dry. While toweling your hair might seem like a good idea, the friction can actually damage your hair, too. Create a turban with a regular or microfiber head towel, instead – you’ll feel like you’ve just been to the spa.First, pat (don’t rub) your hair dry with the towel. Bend over so that your hair hangs down over your head.  Place the towel over the center of the back of your neck and drape it over your hair.  Fold the towel around your head and hair and twist the ends of the towel, making sure that the hair is inside.  Stand up and bring the twisted end of the towel back over your head. Slip the end under the nape of your neck to secure the turban.  Partially air-dry your hair before you style or comb it. This will help you on two fronts: you’ll end up blow-drying it less, for one. But you’ll also protect your hair from wet styling, when the hair is weaker and more prone to damage.Most people should avoid styling wet hair, as it breaks more easily when brushed or combed.  An exception to the rule is people who have kinky or tightly curled hair. For them, brushing the hair when wet will decrease chance of breaks. Just be gentle!  , Over-treatment is the number one cause of hair damage. Pulling too hard at your hair while washing or brushing can put a lot of stress on the hair fibers and strip off the “cuticle,” which is the tough protective outer layer of the hair. Hair with a weakened cuticle will split or break off more often.Don’t brush your hair aggressively.  Shampoo and rinse your hair gently, too. You don’t need to worry about washing frequency if you use care, however. Washing your hair more often shouldn’t cause you to lose hair., People used to advise giving your hair 100 strokes a day to make it shine or to boost blood flow to the scalp. Both of these ideas are wrong. In fact, brushing this much will cause split ends, break hair shafts, or even pull it out. You’ll end up with more hair if you’re not so zealous.Brushing causes friction on the hair. Too much of it will make your hair lusterless or frizzy.  Brush minimally, maybe once per day, in order to detangle or style.  Something else that can cause friction on your hair and lead to damage is the wrong tool. Using a wide-tooth comb or brush will let you detangle and style your hair gently, without putting too much stress on it.Buy a wide-tooth comb/brush at your local pharmacy or salon. Some are designed specifically for detangling and they usually cost less than $20. You can also try a paddle brush with plastic-tipped bristles.  Avoid brushes made from boar’s hair. Natural bristles tend not to be uniform and can be hard on your hair and scalp.  Vitamin E is an antioxidant and potent moisturizer, so it can help reduce inflammation from hair follicles and promote circulation that will improve the growth of your hair.  Hair loss can be a result of weak hair, which itself may result from a poor diet or lack of certain vitamins. To strengthen your hair, make sure that you are getting all the necessary nutrients and eat well.Include fatty fish like salmon in your diet, for example. Salmon contains omega 3 fatty acids, which your body needs to grow hair and keep it full and shiny. Make sure to eat protein, too, the basic building block of hair. Try yoghurt, nuts, and lean meats like chicken.  Leafy greens can also help your hair, as they contain needed nutrients like vitamin A and C, plus beta carotene and folate.  Get enough iron, as well, from things like grains, lentils, beef, and organ meats. Iron deficiency can lead to hair loss.  Finally, condition, condition, condition. Use conditioner after every shampoo to keep your hair strong.  ","avoid styles that pull the hair. avoid weaves and hair extensions. go “no-hold.” another pitfall for hair loss is using styling products for long-lasting hold, like certain kinds of gels and hairsprays. go easy on chemical treatments. know the signs of damaging traction. minimize your use of hair-dryers and other heating tools. wrap your hair with a towel to dry. air-dry your hair before combing or brushing. wash and brush your hair gently. keep brushing to a minimum. use a wide-tooth brush or comb. use products with vitamin e. buy topical products that include vitamin e; you can find shampoos, conditioners, and lotions available online or in stores. strengthen your hair.

"Keeping the milk on or near the door will expose it to more heat or temperature fluctuations from the opening and closing of the refrigerator. In the back the milk will be colder and more likely to keep., Glass, disposable bottle liners, or “mother’s milk” bags are best. Polypropylene or polybutylene hard plastics are preferable to soft plastic polyethylene bags.  It is also important to ensure that other containers in the fridge are closed tightly so that that the milk does not absorb these other odors.  A box of baking soda in the refrigerator can help absorb other smells., Writing the date you expressed the milk on the container can help you make sure you use the older milk first and before it spoils. You can label each container or put all milk from the same week or month together in a bag or box that is labeled.  If you do not plan to use the milk in five to eight days, you should freeze it. Place it in a tightly sealed container in the back of the freezer. Use within 24 hours after thawing.Depending upon how frequently you open the freezer, your milk can last for anywhere from three months to a year.Do not use a microwave to thaw the milk. Thaw it under warm, running water. Do not bring to boil.  It is natural for it to separate into milk and cream while frozen. Swirl it gently to mix these together., If you find that your milk has a soapy flavor and that this is a problem for your baby, you should scald it. Heat to about 180 °F (82.2 °C) (it should show signs of a full bubble, but not a rolling boil). Immediately afterward cool and store the milk.  If this flavor does not bother your child, do not scald it. The milk will lose some of its nutrients in the process.

"Ask him if he fancies any of them and why. Of course, act natural, as if this is just a conversation to get him to talk about his favorite pastime!  Take note of what he says. If it's not something likely to stick in your head, quickly write down the names of the things he's mentioned so that you can search for them later online or in stores.;  , Look at what your dad has by way of gadgets, apps, tools and resources. Notice where there are gaps or where things could do with updating. For example, maybe he loves iPods and downloading podcasts, music, etc. but he has an older iPod. You could invest in the latest iPod for him. Or perhaps he needs a case for it, or a groovy gadget for wrapping up the cord.  If you're concerned that your dad already 'has it all covered' in his techie interest, consider introducing him to other techie related things that he might enjoy but doesn't yet know much about. Some examples include:  A pen that is able to read and make a record of handwritten notes––this might be ideal for the dad who is techie and loves to travel, spend time outdoors, etc. and totes along a notebook.  A compact disc mixer, so dad can mix his music for fun. Or, give him a portable electronic keyboard so that he can modernize his music playing skills wherever he goes.

Explain to him that his loyalty to old times is admirable but that he's also missing out on a lot by not moving forward. Be careful though––old-fashioned techies love the way that old things were easily hacked, so the new item may be left gathering dust or it might just find itself inserted into the older technology!  , A book about his favorite techie toys, such as a biography on the inventor of the gadget, a swashbuckling tale featuring techie themes, an insider's guide to pulling apart his techie gadget, etc. Then there are the deeper books about where the internet is taking us as a species, what it means to set information free or to repress it, and so forth, to encourage some deep thinking for dad.

Here are just a few cool ideas for making your own hacks for dad's gift:  Use bulldog clips to tidy dad's cords under his desk.  Boost dad's wi fi using a beer can. This is great if he likes both beer and all things techie!  Make a multi-purpose hand tool for the dad who likes tinkering.  Turn an old TV into a fish tank. Your dad will be amazed and entertained.  Knit him an iPod cozy, sew him an iPod carrying case or build him a stand for his laptop or iPod. Or, make a laptop bag for him to carry his laptop in style.  Make a duct tape cellphone case for the dad who likes duct tape.  Bake him a cake in the shape of his favorite gadget.

You could cover the flight/travel costs, plus conference entrance and accommodation. Just be sure to check he'll be free for the dates and then make the arrangements. This is a gift sure to floor him.  This might need the help of a friend of your dad's who is willing to go with him or to help with details. Alternatively, consider accompanying him if the conference interests you too.  Perhaps you could both reverse engineer a gadget that has been annoying you both for a while and see if you can fix it.

"Your best bet for a safe and successful travel homestay is to book it through a reputable agency, company, or website. You should choose an agency that has been booking homestays in your destination for a considerable period of time and has high ratings from customers. Reputable resources for booking travel homestays include:  Airbnb.com  CouchSurfing.com  Homestay.com  Servas.org;  , If you can’t find information on a homestay in your travel destination from a reputable homestay resource, you can try contacting the local tourism board or chamber of commerce. These entities will often have lists of homestays in the region, or may be able to connect you to families and individuals offering homestays in your destination., If you are booking your travel homestay through a reputable online agency or company, read online reviews of your host. Many sites, like airbnb.com, have built-in review systems that allow you to read reviews of your potential hosts. Pay attention to bad reviews, even if there is only one of them., You should always ask for references from other travelers before booking a homestay. If the booking agency does not have a built-in review system, ask for contact information of former guests and contact them yourself. Do not rely on the agency to send you written reviews from former guests. Make sure you contact former guests yourself., If you have friends, family, or acquaintances who have previously traveled to your destination, reach out to them. Ask them where they stayed, and if they have suggestions for you. Sometimes the best travel homestays are found by talking to those already within your networks.  If you are a student seeking a travel homestay, you should take advantage of resources at your school. Chances are your school has existing homestay networks in your destination of choice. They can also connect you to other students that have had successful travel homestay experiences in the region to which you will be traveling.  ","utilize a reputable agency. try the local tourism board. read online reviews. ask for references before booking. talk to friends and family. meet with your school’s study abroad department. "

"This will provide you with the necessary mental framework to recognize and make sense of the motor and touch sensations of verbal articulation.  The mechanics of speech is best presented via study sessions using a series of pictures to present the position of the tongue and mouth, etc., for each sound, which in turn is related back to the study of phonetics. The learning of phonetics and the mechanics of speech is best aided with an illustrated and detailed breakdown of how each sound is made, which can be found in the title 'The Missing Memory Link' by J Rowan.  Then, practice this in the reverse order: imagine or evoke a phrase and then say it out loud, all the time concentrating on the sensation of each component. This swapping round of the activities will help you to build a stable and more accurate physical representation of speech.  However, give yourself a secondary task designed to create interference. This use of a secondary task is intended to inhibit the functioning areas from assisting in verbal representation and potentially drowning out the benefits of the therapy by forcing the under functioning area to assume the full workload.  ","gain a working knowledge of the phonetic alphabet and the mechanics of speech. speak a phrase and then imagine saying that phrase whilst concentrating on the sensation of speech. complete these tasks again.

"Children pay attention to everything adults do and say. They also imitate and repeat it, especially when we don’t want them to. When you are teaching children impulse control you should provide an example with your own behavior.Pay attention to what you do and say to make sure you are being a good role model.  Take particular care when you are in tense or stressful situations and children are around. Remind yourself that you are being a role model.  Don’t assume that because a child is young that they are listening to everything you say and watching everything you do.  Without doubt, you will find yourself with the children in a situation where you have to use self-control. Use it as an opportunity to model appropriate behavior and teach impulse control. Talk to the children about what is happening, how you feel about it, and what you are doing to control your impulses.  For example, if you are waiting in a long line, you might say, “This line is moving slowly and it’s frustrating me. I’m tired and ready to go. I want to scream, but I’m going to control myself.”  Or, for instance, you might say, “I really want that new jacket. I can’t afford it though and it’s disappointing me. I think I need to do something I can afford in order to lift my spirits.”  , Explicitly doing things like breathing, taking a time-out, and counting when you are upset provides children of all ages with an example of how to control their impulses.Even if you don’t necessarily need to do them, walking through the steps of calming yourself out-loud in tense situations provides a good model of impulse control for children.  For instance, you could say, “I’m going to put myself in time-out right now because I can tell I’m getting really angry with my friend.”  Or, for example, you might tell them, “I need to calm down. I’m going to do some deep breathing for a moment to relax myself before I get upset.”  , It can be frustrating to try to teach children impulse control regardless of whether they are toddlers, preschoolers, school-age, or teens. But you will all be less stressed and they will learn how to control their impulses better if you maintain a good attitude.Try to find the positive side of all situations. For example, if a child is upset because they spilled their milk, you might say, “Don’t cry over your milk. After we clean it up, we can get you some more.”  Keep a good attitude when interacting with the children. Even though they may be impulsive, treat them with respect and caring.  ","monitor yourself. talk about it. make a point of using relaxation techniques. be positive. "
"Friends, family, co-workers and neighbors are great resources when you need to find a service care provider. You might also ask your doctor or pharmacist. Good questions to ask include: What they like about the dentist and/or office? Is there anything they don’t like about it?  Ask how long they typically wait, and how available the dentist is for questions or emergencies.;  , Find a dentist near you who is a member of the American Dental Association by visiting their website.You can also find dentists through the online yellow pages and other advertising sites.  Be wary of any advertising that claims a dentist’s service is “superior” to others’. This is considered unethical in most states., Your health insurance provider can likely provide a list of dentists participating in their coverage. You can also call faculty members at a dental school, if there is one near you, or a local hospital to see if they have an accredited dental service.You can also call the Academy of General Dentistry’s referral line—1-877-2XA-YEAR. Call your state dental society and ask for a list of recommendations. These associations can provide a list of ADA member dentists., If you have dental insurance, be sure to ask any prospective dentists if they accept your plan. Many smaller companies have a limited number of participating dentists, and dental work can be extremely expensive.  Dentists must either be a doctor of dental surgery (DDS) or a doctor of dental medicine (DMD). These degrees are equivalent and require the same coursework, including two years or pre-dental college classes and four years of dental school.They also must pass national and state exams to be licensed practitioners.Call and ask the office from which school this dentist earned his or her degree.Also ask how long they have been with this particular practice, and how long they have been practicing in general. A newly graduated dentist might have both advantages and disadvantages over an established dentist, particularly in terms of availability, cost, experience with difficult cases, and approachability, but it is really a personal preference. The important thing is that they can answer these questions.  Do they regularly attend conferences or take continuing education classes?You may want a dentist who stays up-to-date on the latest health information and techniques, especially if you plan to have major work done on your teeth.  Dentists can also get certified by state boards to specialize in certain areas after completing at least two years of advanced schooling.If you know you need a certain type of work done or are looking for a dentist for your child, you might want to find a specialist in one of these areas:Endodontics (root canal therapy)  Oral Pathology (dealing with oral cancer or lesions) or Surgery (removal of teeth and tissues)  Orthodontics (braces and repositioning teeth)  Pediatric Dentistry (cares exclusively for children and teens)  Periodontics (care of gums)  Prosthodontics (full mouth rehabilitation)  , Each state has an online registry on which you can track any history of claims made against a dentist practicing in that state. Google your state’s board of dentistry to find their website.Be wary of dentists with cases brought against them for misconduct or patient dissatisfaction.  If you found the dentist online, check for reviews on websites like Google and Yelp. If you were referred to this dentist by a friend or saw their ad somewhere, call and ask if they can provide a list of references.  Be wary of reviews on the office’s or dentist’s own webpage. Consider them in conjunction with those on other sites they are not associated with.  A bad review or two doesn’t mean the dentist is no good. Read the whole review and assess whether there was a good reason for giving a dentist a lower score.  Are their hours flexible according to your work schedule? Is the practice located conveniently near your home or office? Do they have emergency hours or dentists on call at all times?  Not all dentists will meet all of these preferences. Decide which is/are the most important to you.  If you do not get paid time off for medical visits, you will probably prefer a dentist with a wider range of hours.  If you drive an SUV that gets ten miles to the gallon or have to take your children to multiple extracurricular activities, you may put location at the top of your list.  Before scheduling any dental work or appointments, ask for a consultation so you can visit the office, meet the dentist, and ask him or her questions about the service they would provide you.Questions for the dentist include: what kinds of anesthesia do they use?; do they provide anything special to help you feel more comfortable during dental work, like noise cancelling headphones?; will they go over all procedures with you in detail and answer any questions you have?  Questions for the office staff include: what is the policy regarding missed appointments?; how long in advance must you cancel for no fee?; does the office have dentists on call at all times, and if so, how do patients reach them?  You might also want to ask for price estimates on common procedures, so you can compare their costs with other dentists you are considering.To perform pricing research for your procedure, you may access a credible source to obtain surveys directed to dental pricing per geographic region and dentist specialty.  Make sure the office is clean and examination rooms are sterilized properly. Determine how friendly and helpful the office staff and dentist are in general.A rude office staff will make all of your visits frustrating, and might make you feel taken advantage of since you are paying for services you could get elsewhere. If the staff isn’t respectful, walk out and find another office to visit.  If the dentists and staff are rude to each other, this could indicate a bad working environment. You want to visit an office where everybody gets along and is able to work together in your best interest.  This exam includes a cleaning and x-rays. Evaluate how well you get along with the dentist, how comfortable you feel with them and their office and whether they do a complete job. Do they show interest in your health? Do they ask you questions about your medical history? If not, then at most they are “putting out fires” instead of addressing underlying problems. Move on to your second choice.  Are they personable? Do they exhibit patience and explain anything you don’t understand completely? If they cannot explain why you have to have a treatment or procedure, then maybe you don’t really need it. And if they aren’t concerned with making you as comfortable as possible, you aren’t getting the best treatment money can buy.  Do they demonstrate professionalism, including valuing your time and money?  ","ask people you know for a recommendation. look online. call a health care organization for a referral. make sure they take your health care plan. check their qualifications. decide if you require a particular specialization. check with the state dental board. look for online reviews or ask for references. determine their convenience for you. schedule a consultation and ask about their general practices. assess the professionalism of the office and all staff. schedule a general exam.

"Even with the best intentions, eating out at fast food restaurants or stopping by a convenience store may be the only option you have. However, reading the entire menu or walking through the entire store can help you get a good idea of what healthy options are available.  Review menus online before choosing a restaurant and make sure you have some healthy options. Or become familiar with the menu of your favorite quick restaurants. Find a few items that will fall into your healthy eating plan and stick to those.  Review the nutrition stats of different foods. Restaurants that have more than 20 locations are required to have nutrition information online and in the store.Find options that fit into your calorie guidelines or other nutrition requirements.  Avoid combo meals. This is when the calorie count can get really high at fast food restaurants. Stick to just a small sandwich or wrap if possible.  Avoid deep fried items if possible. Most fast food chains do offer grilled versions of a variety of sandwiches, wraps, and other meals. Choose grilled over fried for a lower-fat meal.;  , The typical fast food restaurants are not the only quick option. Many places serve soups, salads, lower-calorie sandwiches and other items that are not as processed, are lower in calories, and are slightly healthier for you.  Try using a map app on your smart phone or doing a quick internet search of available options in your current location. Look for something outside the typical burger and fry joint.  Remember, although some restaurants offer fresh salads and sandwiches, their foods aren't necessarily low calorie. Again, it's important to review the menu and nutrition information online first.  If you're feeling famished and have no time to cook, swing by a grocery store for quick and healthy meal. Most stores will have a variety of options to fit your timeline.  No time at all? Pick up something from the salad bar or hot bar. Choose lean protein, vegetables, fruit and whole grains. Try avoid things that are higher in fat (like mac and cheese) or fried (like fried chicken).  Many stores also offer pre-made meals and cold pre-packaged salads (like chicken or tuna salad). Be wary of the fat and calorie content, but a small cup of chicken salad with a piece of fruit is a great quick meal.  Not all your meals need to be 100% home cooked or made from scratch. Some convenience foods are still moderately healthy in addition to being quick. Surprisingly, gas stations sometimes have healthier food than fast food establishments.  Healthy convenience store foods can include: frozen low-calorie dinners (but be aware of the sodium content), low-calorie canned soups (again, watch the sodium content), individual packages of nuts, or 'protein packs' (many stores sell small packages of lean protein foods like nuts, cheese, hard boiled eggs or deli meat alongside a fruit or veggie).  Convenience foods to avoid include: high calorie/high fat frozen foods (like pizza or chicken nuggets), fried foods from grocery store/convenience store hot bars, canned pastas, processed meats (like hot dogs) and pre-made sandwiches or subs.  Consume convenience store foods with awareness and moderation. Many times what makes convenience foods 'convenient' is extra processing. Sometimes this doesn't affect the nutritional value all that much and other times it does. Exercise caution and use your best judgement.  ","read the entire menu at restaurants. choose restaurants with healthier options. stop by the grocery store. purchase convenience store foods. "
"Depilatory creams painlessly cause hair to fall out from the root, but because the chemicals involved in this process are harsh, it’s best to select a cream designed for delicate facial skin.  Apply a small dab to a sensitive but safe area (such as the skin of your inner wrist) to make sure you don’t react. Leave on for the recommended amount of time (read the box for instructions), wash away thoroughly, and wait at least another 10 or 15 minutes to make sure you don’t itch or turn red.  You can do this with gloves if you prefer, but since the cream needs time to take effect, you can also use you bare hands and then wash thoroughly with soap and water.  When possible, it’s better to use it for less time to prevent your skin from becoming irritated. If it’s not ready, wait a little longer.  Use a paper towel or cotton pads  , Rinse more than you think you need to so that no residue will irritate your skin. If some hairs do not come off easily, just try rubbing them gently with water. If that doesn't work, take a bath. The steam coming from the bath should make tough hairs come out on their own.  , On the one hand, the area may feel dry and in need of a little TLC, but on the other, using too much product on already-irritated skin might cause the pores to clog.

"Surgery is usually only advised for women who have underlying problems and require medical intervention to stop the bleeding. Common underlying problems include abnormal growths in the uterus like fibroids and polyps.  A procedure called myomectomy can be used to remove fibroid growths from the uterus. This is usually done under general anesthesia.  Alternatively, the blood supply to the fibroids can be cut off in a procedure called uterine artery embolization. The polyps that are in the uterus can also be removed in a procedure called a polypectomy. This procedure is advised when the bleeding is excessive and the patient has fibroids in the uterus.  The patient is likely to have staining or spotting for up to eight weeks after surgery, and is advised to avoid the use of tampons in order to prevent infection. The woman may also be advised to avoid sexual intercourse until completely recovered to allow healing.  Endometrial ablation is when the lining of the uterus is removed or destroyed.  This will either significantly reduce the amount of menstrual bleeding, or stop the patient's periods altogether. This is not a good option for people who are planning to have more children in the future.  This procedure is usually done in the doctor’s office or it can also be done in a health center. The woman may have nausea, cramping, and vaginal discharge that is mixed with blood after the surgery.  These symptoms may last for approximately 1 to 2 weeks. After this time, the menstrual period is reduced in some women, while other women will stop having their period altogether.  There are several different techniques that can be used for endometrial ablation and they include:  Electrocautery: This is where an electric current that travels through a roller ball is used to cauterize the endometrial lining.  Hydrothermal therapy:This is where heated fluid is pumped into the uterus and the endometrial lining is destroyed by high temperatures.  Balloon therapy: A balloon filled with fluid is attached to a catheter and inserted in the uterus. This water is heated, causing it to erode the endometrial tissue.  This is a surgical procedure in which the whole uterus is removed. This procedure is done in a surgical theater by a surgeon.  This procedure is usually done in women who are in menopause or in those who are not planning to have any more children. As the uterus is removed entirely, the woman will no longer experience menstruation or be able to bear children.  The patient will usually have to stay in the hospital for approximately four days following the procedure for observation. Once discharged, it is important that the patient takes it slow and avoids heavy lifting for a number of weeks, until they are fully recovered.  ","understand when surgery is necessary. undergo a procedure to remove fibroids or polyps. have endometrial ablation to remove the lining of the uterus. understand the different methods of endometrial ablation. consider a hysterectomy.

"It's best to use the odd sock that isn't useful anymore; avoid using a sock that's still in regular use. The sock should be ankle or mid-shin length; anything longer risks bunching up. Shorter socks tend to cradle your bun and hold it in place.  Select a sock that won’t “shed” or create too many loose threads. You'll be cutting this sock, so if it tends to unravel with loose threads, find another or be prepared to darn the edges.  Socks close in color to your hair color work best, as it will blend in more should it peek through your strands.;  , Remove the toe-end of the sock using sharp, fabric scissors. Your goal is to create a tube out of the sock, so only cut off as much as is needed to do this. Follow the seam if possible when cutting. That way you will have a cleaner, straighter cut.  Roll up the sock so that it is donut or ring shaped, and slip it over the ponytail. Pull it to the base of the ponytail so that all of the hair is gathered inside of it.  Once all the hair is gathered inside the sock, pull it as close to the ends as you can. Tuck the hair around the side and into the center of the bun.  Hold the ends of your hair at the center of the sock and roll the fabric down towards the base of the ponytail. The hair will gather in a ring around the sock. Rotate the sock as you roll it down so that it is completely covered by your hair.  When the sock has reached the base of the ponytail, tug on the edges and adjust them so that none of the sock can be seen through your hair.

"Commodities trading has been around for many years. Originally, commodities exchanges sold futures contracts so that manufacturers and farmers could buy contracts to guarantee the price of an input of production or crop at a future date. These players still use commodities futures for that purpose, but now speculators have entered the market to bet on the changing prices of commodities and related securities.  Commodities and related securities are traded on a number of large exchanges throughout the world.Commodities can include any of the following types of products:  Energy, like crude oil and natural gas.  Metals, including precious metals, like gold and silver, and non-precious metal like copper.  Livestock and meat, like cattle and pork bellies.  Agricultural products, like corn, wheat, rice, and sugar.;  , A trader can make bets on commodities prices in a number of ways. Commodities, however, are rarely physically traded. The logistics involved in trading actual commodities make doing so too complicated. Most market participants purchase securities or contracts related to commodities instead. These financial products include:  Commodities futures. These are the type used most frequently by experienced traders and financial institutions. Futures are contracts that give the holder the right to purchase a set amount of a commodities for a set amount at or before a time in the future. Trading futures is risky and should only be done by experienced investors.  Commodity stocks. Traders can also focus on stocks related to commodities, rather than the commodities themselves. For example, a trader might purchase stock in a silver mining company if they expected a rise in the price of silver.  Mutual funds. There are a number of mutual funds that track certain commodities or segments of the commodities markets.  Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). ETFs are like mutual funds but are traded like individual stocks. Some ETFs track individual commodities, like gold or crude oil., Anyone interested in commodities trading should read books on its practice before getting started.

This guide, published by the National Futures Association, can be downloaded for free by visiting http://www.nfa.futures.org/. Other great resources include:  A Complete Guide to the Futures Markets: Fundamental Analysis, Technical Analysis, Trading, Spreads, and Options by Jack D. Schwager.  Hot Commodities: How Anyone Can Invest Profitably in the World's Best Market by Jim Rogers.  Commodities Rising: The Reality Behind the Hype and How To Really Profit in the Commodities Market by Jeff Christian., Commodities trading is traditionally regarded as somewhat riskier than stock trading. This is largely due to the fact that most commodities futures are bought on margin. This means that the trader essentially invests with borrowed money, paying a small amount to control a large amount of commodities. For example, a trader might pay $10,000 to control $100,000 worth of crude oil.  Trading on margin magnifies potential returns and potential losses. This is because returns are from the controlled commodity amount, not the amount of the investment.  This means that you can earn $1,000 from the $10,000 investment if the price goes up 1 percent.  However, this also means that you can lose a substantial amount of money and, in some cases, be responsible for making up a loss that constitutes more than you originally invested., Make it a daily habit to read the financial news on commodities. You will get a picture of how the market is doing. Find out if crude oil fell today and by how much. Learn, for example, that the price of gold has been trending up for the past month because investors are uncertain about the economy. Financial news websites, including Bloomberg, Investor’s Business Daily, and the Wall Street Journal, will let you know when futures contracts are about to expire. Reading these sources can help you decide what commodities to trade.  This type of analysis is known as fundamental analysis and is designed to predict prices based on supply and demand for the commodity., Now that you have an idea about which commodities you want to take a closer look at, you should use technical analysis. This consists of predicting the direction of a commodity’s price by investigating its past price behavior, meaning changes in volume and price. Technical analysis requires the use of current price information, which will likely be available through your trading platform., Study charts to visually identify patterns and trends. These patterns can let you see if a commodity might be topping or bottoming out. Identifying these patterns can help you decide if you should buy or sell a particular commodity. Some of the most common patterns are:  Head and shoulders top.  Triple top.  Double bottom.  Double top., To get a better understanding of where a commodity is trending, apply technical indicators. These are mathematical formulas involving price and volume. Two of the most widely-used indicators are moving averages and the relative strength index. Technical indicators may be constructed by a trader or purchased as part of analysis software.One example of a technical indicator is Moving Average Convergence and Divergence (MACD). This tool attempts to assess current trends to predict future trends in the market.  For more on using MACD, see how to read MACD. This article also contains a method for constructing moving averages in Excel.  Devising a trading system does not just involve using technical analysis. There are a few things you must consider before executing any trades, such as setting up entry and exit strategies. For example, you should employ stop orders to protect your money. These are orders that automatically sell a security if the price drops below a certain point. When trading commodities, good money-management skills are crucial to preserve your capital.  Avoid overtrading, which is making too many quick, unprofitable trades in the hope that one of them will end up being profitable., Don’t be too quick to put your money at risk. Instead, test your trading system. You can see how your system would have fared if you had actually used it in the marketplace. Most online brokerage firms offer this service free for thirty days.

Generic Trade.  MB.  Lightspeed., Fill out the brokerage firm’s application and wait for approval. For faster service, complete the application online. Keep in mind there’s a minimum-balance requirement you must meet. Ask your broker what the minimum balance is for their company.  In the application process, you will likely be asked questions about your net worth and trading experience. Based on these questions, the platform will allow you to take on a certain level of risk.  When you've signed up, take a tour of the features available from the platform and locate a tutorial on how to use them.Most platforms require at least $2,500 or $5,000 as an initial deposit., Place an order for a futures contract by specifying the commodity, date, and other terms of the order. The terms of the order might include how the order is to be settled, either for cash or for delivery. The order is submitted to the broker, who then has the order filled at market. At this point, money is taken from your account to pay for the order.  You can issue an additional 'stop' order to sell your position if the price of the commodity drops below a certain point., You can reduce your risk by taking on less leverage than you need. While your $5,000 may entitle you to $50,000 worth of futures contracts, you should take it easy at first, especially if you are inexperienced. Try trading one or two contracts at a time to limit your leverage and, therefore, your risk. By doing so, you can avoid the pitfalls that affect so many commodities traders., Commodities traders do not find success over night. Figuring out when to buy and to sell, and which commodities to trade, is a difficult and labor-intensive process that takes years to master.

Do not cut along the folded side.  Set these strips aside for now.  Fold the fitted skirt four times length-wise and then place the waistband of the folded fitted skirt over the edge of the folded corner of your stretch material. Use the width of the folded fitted skirt as a guide for how wide to make the waistband of your circle skirt.  To create the waistband, take your scissors and cut a half circle for the waistband that is about the same width as the width of the folded fitted skirt.  It is better to cut the waist a little smaller. Remember that the fabric is stretchy and you can always make it a little wider if you need to.  If you prefer, you can also measure your waist circumference with a measuring tape. Just divide the number by four to determine how wide to make the cut for the waist.  Next, take your scissors and cut along the outer edge of the bottom of the skirt (the unfolded part). Make sure that the bottom of the skirt is about the same length all around. You may need to trim more or less fabric off of some areas to create a nice circular shape.  Don’t worry if there are a few jagged edges at the bottom of your skirt. You will be hemming the bottom edges, which will cover up any minor imperfections.  Unfold the fabric once so that is it just folded in half. Then unfold your fitted skirt and hold the waistband of it up against the waist of your circle skirt. This will help you to determine if the waist is the correct size.  If it is too small, then you can make it a bit wider.  Next, take the fabric that you set aside for your waistband and place it next to the waist of your skirt. You should have two strips on top of each other with the patterns facing each other (if the fabric has a pattern). Place the strips near the waist and cut the edges of the strip so that you will have enough to hem the waistband.  Since the waist is a half circle and the strips are straight, you may want to measure for this part or at least cut a little more fabric than you think you will need.  Take your waistband pieces and make sure that they are lined up. If the fabric has a pattern, it should still be facing in. Take your two waistband pieces and sew them together along the short edges. Then, hem the long edges by folding about a half inch of the fabric over and sewing along the edge of this fabric.  Use a regular stitch to sew the waistband.  You do not need to use any elastic for the waistband since you are using stretch fabric.  Open up your circle skirt and lay it out on your table or floor. Then take your waistband and start pinning it onto the waist of your circle skirt. As you pin on the waistband, make sure that the print side of your waistband faces the print side of your circle skirt.  The edges of the waistband and the circle skirt edge should be even as well.  Start by pinning one edge to the circle skirt and then pin the opposite edge. Then, pin the part of the waistband that is halfway between the two pins you just placed. Then, pin the part of the waistband across from that pin. Keep pinning in the way to ensure an even distribution of the waistband.  After your waistband is pinned to your circle skirt, start sewing along the edge of your waistband and circle skirt waist with a zig-zag stitch. Remove the pins as you go.  Make sure that you stretch both pieces of fabric a bit as you sew to make sure that they will be even and smooth.  After you are done, just flip the waistband fabric over and tuck it into the waist when you wear it.  Before you hem the skirt, you will need to fold the edges over. Create the fold about a half inch away from the edge of the skirt bottom all the way around. You can pin the edges if you want to be sure that the hem will be even or you can just fold the edges as you go.  Another option is to start with a baste stitch to mark the hem fold. You can sew a baste stitch about ½ inch away from your skirt edge and then use this stitch as a guide as you fold over the material and sew the hem. Fold along the baste stitch as if it is a perforated line. Then, you can either remove the baste stitch or fold over the edge again and sew.For even more accuracy, try sewing a piece of ribbon onto the inner edge of your skirt bottom. Then, fold over the ribbon and sew again. The ribbon can also help to provide some structure and added body to your circle skirt., Sew the hem using a regular stitch. Make sure that the edges are even all around the skirt. If you are worried about making a mistake, then you can always start with a basting stitch and then go over it with a regular stitch when you are happy with the results.  Hemming a skirt can be a challenge because of the curved edges. Go slow and try to be patient.  Try ironing the edge before you sew. You can also iron the hem edge flat before you sew it in place. This may reduce the chances of puckering material or uneven spots., After you finish the hem, trim away and loose excess threads along your hem and waistband. Now your skirt is ready to wear! You can wear a circle skirt lots of different ways, so have fun experimenting.  Try pairing your circle skirt with a fitted t-shirt and pair of sandals for an easy spring or summer look, or wear it with tights, a sweater, and some boots for a cute fall or winter look.  ","gather your materials. fold the fabric four times. cut a bit of fabric off for your waistband. use the fitted skirt as a guide for the waist. cut the bottom of the skirt. check the width of the waistband. measure fabric for the waistband. sew the waistband pieces. pin the waistband to your circle skirt. attach the waistband to your circle skirt. fold over the edges of the skirt bottom. hem the skirt. trim off excess thread and wear your skirt.

"You will need two pieces of flannel fabric, 2¼ yards (2.1 meters) each.It needs to be about 44 to 45 inches (1.2 meters) wide. You can use two different solid colors, two different patterns, or a solid color and a pattern.  Spread your first piece of fabric down on the floor, right side up. Place your second piece of fabric on top, right side down. Make sure that the long edges match up with the long edges, and the short edges match up with the short edges. Pin the two pieces together along the edges.  Sew around the blanket using a ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) seam allowance. Remove the pins as you sew. Leave a gap in one edge that is big enough for you to turn the fabric inside out. It needs to be about ¼ to ½ the length of one edge., Try to get as close to the stitching as you can without actually cutting through it. This will help reduce bulk, and make your blanket lay smoother.  Use something blunt, but pointy, like a pencil or knitting needle, to push out the corners. This will make them nice and crisp.  Be sure to use a flannel or cotton setting. When you reach the gap, carefully tuck the raw edges into the blanket so that they match up with the rest of the hems. If you need to, use pins to keep the gap closed.  You can use matching or contrasting thread colors for the topstitching. A matching thread color will blend in more easily, but a contrasting thread color will make a nice design.  If you need to, use sewing pins to hold the gap shut. Remember to remove the pins while you sew.  ","choose your flannel fabric. pin the two pieces of fabric together, wrong sides facing out. sew around the fabric, but leave a gap for turning. clip the corners. turn your blanket right side out through the gap. press the seams with an iron. topstitch around the blanket, including the gap.use a ⅛-inch (0.32-centimeter) seam allowance. finished.

"You'll want to change the strings on your ukulele if one of these apply:  The tuning accuracy down the neck differs.  The strings buzz when they didn't before.  You run your fingers under the strings and can feel dents where the frets have damaged the strings.  The string has snapped.  The strings are peeling.;  ,  If you have a Concert-sized ukulele, you should buy a 23' string.  If you have a Tenor ukulele, you should buy a 26' string.  If you have a Baritone ukulele, you should buy a 30' string.  There are many different types of materials used to make ukulele strings.  Nylon is often used because of its round and warm sound which mimics the sound of gut strings. It also provides tuning stability and resistance to humidity.  Fluorocarbon strings provide an even fuller sound than nylon string and reacts less to temperature change.  Titanium strings offer strength and durability with a louder and brighter sound.  Steel strings can be used on the ukulele, but it not recommended as it may cause damage to the bridge and neck of the instrument.  Before tying the string to the ukulele, you need to create a knot in the string.  First, make a simple knot in the string.  Make a loop.  Overlap the loop on the knot, pulling it downward.  Tighten the loop on the knot.  The number depends on how your bridge was made. Larger tie blocks can take up to three loops on the thinner strings while narrow tie blocks usually take only two. The fatter strings on the ukulele usually only wrap around once or twice., Then pull the string taut and set it into the notch in the nut., You can check out How to Tune a Ukulele for how to do that.

"Stretch your legs out straight and hold your arms outstretched at your sides. It's important to use the right form when you're doing the bicycle crunch - if you don't you won't be getting the maximum benefits from this exercise.  ;  , You can interlock your fingers if you desire. If you prefer, you can keep your arms at your sides.  Raise them so that your thighs are perpendicular to the ground, and your calves are parallel to the ground. Keep your feet together. This is called tabletop position.  Now lift your head up and touch your right elbow to the left knee while pulling your knee up towards your head. At the same time, straighten your right leg, keeping it several inches off of the floor - similar to the motion you'd make while pedaling a bicycle.  As you lift your head, tense your abs. Use your abdominal muscles to crunch your body forward so that your elbow can reach your knee.  At the same time, tense your leg muscles and be sure to keep them bent or straightened correctly. Don't rest your feet on the ground.  Be sure to keep your elbows back, rather than bringing them forward toward your chest, which could strain your neck.

"Gather three to six braids on the side of your head, near your ear. Braid them together and secure with a hairband. Repeat on the other side, then bring the two larger braids toward the back of your head and secure with a clip.  Attach flexi rods or perm rods to the ends of your braids. Dip them in warm water for 7–10 seconds, then dry gently with a towel. Release the ends and check out your new curls or waves.  You can add this step to most of the other style ideas.  Bring braids across the top of your head, taking alternating braids from the left and right sides. Cross them over each other at the center to make a basket weave pattern.

"Be aware that yarn that is too thick will not make very practical socks––though it will make a nice set of slippers!;  , As this sock pattern is symmetrical, you will need five needles: four to hold the work, and one floating needle to work the sock with.  Take two needles and wrap the yarn around them in a figure-of-eight. Each loop will become a stitch. For small to medium socks cast on eight loops on each of the two needles, and for large socks cast on ten.  Then take the first needle and knit the stitches on the second needle. The stitches should now be on the first and third needles. These stitches are allowed to become loose, as you will be tightening them up later.  You should find this cast on gradually less awkward!  , Knit until you are halfway over the needle. Insert a marker, to mark the centre-back of the sock. Take a new needle, and knit until there is one stitch left, make 1 and knit the last stitch.  To make one stitch hold your work flat and find the yarn from the previous row suspended between the needles. Pick it up using the tip of the right-hand needle, move it onto the left-hand needle and knit it as if it were a normal stitch.  The work should be symmetrical and there should be all four needles active plus one floating needle. On large socks you should have six stitches per needle, and on smaller ones you should have five.  Knit the first row (all four needles), and add stitches in this way to the next. Every other row, add stitches in this way. Continue until you have 11 (small), 12 (medium), 13 (large) or 14 (very large) stitches on each of your four needles.  (If the foot is not present, ask for measurements in advance!)  , Keeping the end-stitches very tight will prevent structural holes. This method is called knitting short rows.  Switch to a new mode: work only on the two needles on either side of your marker. Leave the two needles for the front of the sock idle, and knit back and forth (using knit and purl) on the back two needles to construct the heel. Treat these two needles as one––you can even slip them all onto one needle, as long as you can keep the symmetry going.  The first half of the heel involves systematically putting stitches 'on hold'. Knit all stitches except the last, then slip the yarn to the front of the work (between the needles). Slip the unknitted stitch onto the other needle and slip the yarn to the back of the work again. Turn the work around, and slip the unknitted stitch back onto the empty needle––then continue to purl as usual. This should result in the unknitted stitch being 'a row behind', looking like it has been looped by the yarn. It will be 'on hold' until you pick it up again later. It will remain on the needle, and there will always be the same number of stitches on the needle.  Purl the rest of the row except the last stitch, 'wrapping' it in the same way, leaving it unknitted and dormant.  Turn the work and knit, until there are two left on the needle (one of which is dormant). Wrap this second-to-last stitch as before, and turn the work. Purl all but the last two stitches, wrap the second-to-last stitch, and turn the work.  Each row, wrap the next stitch in until you've wrapped seven stitches on each side. The last row of this process should be purling, followed by wrapping the seventh stitch.  To finish the second half of the heel, begin picking up the stitches one at a time. Knit one row, and when you get to the first wrapped stitch, pick up the loop at the same time and knit it. Wrap the next stitch again. Then turn the work around and start purling. This stitch is now 'active' again.  At the end of each row, pick up and 'reactivate' another stitch, knitting the loop with the stitch. Each time you do this, wrap the next inactive stitch as you did when de-activating them.  When you've reactivated all the stitches, you should have a heel-shaped piece of knitting. The last row of the heel should be a purl row, and you should pick up and activate the last of the wrapped stitches.  Knit until you reach the part where the heel joins the main part of the sock that you've been ignoring.  If at this point you continue to knit, there will most likely be a little but annoying hole in the ankle where the heel rejoins the sock. The next step is written in to prevent this.  When you get to the part where the heel rejoins the main sock, pick up the yarn from between the two needles and make a new stitch. On the next pass, knit this with the stitch next to it, two together. This will prevent the annoying hole. Do the same thing on the other side of the heel.  Ribbing will prevent the top of the sock from curling up - though if you'd like a pixie-boot effect for slippers or similar then feel free to ignore this step!  ,  ","choose the yarn you'd like to use. choose double-pointed needles to fit your wool. try this cast-on, which means that you won't have to sew the toe up later. take a third needle and knit each loop on the first needle. notice how the stitches, when knitted on each needle, are suspended between the two double pointed needles. using the third needle (the floating needle), knit 1, make 1 (using the loop between stitches). do the same on the second casting-on needle. remember this pattern of adding a stitch at the second and penultimate stitch on each side. knit until the sock is about 4cm (1.5') from the back of the heel when tried on. begin working the heel. get all your needles back to normal again, with four active needles (symmetrical) and one floating needle. continue to knit the whole four needles as you were before you started the heel. continue to knit until you're an inch or two from the top, and then begin to k2p2 (knit 2, purl 2) for the ribbing. cast off very loosely, even looser than you think might be needed, because tight casting-off can mean that your sock is hard to get on and uncomfortable.

"HIIT workouts or high intensity interval training are a popular new form of exercise. These types of workouts have a variety of benefits and can be done with any type of cardio equipment including a treadmill.  HIIT workouts are usually a little shorter in length — maybe 20–30 minutes — and alternate between very high intensity exercise and more moderate intensity exercise.On a treadmill, you can alternate between sprinting and jogging or between jogging and running on an incline. You want your heart rate to be significantly higher during the higher intensity bouts during a HIIT workout.  HIIT workouts have been shown to burn more calories from fat and can help your body continue to burn more calories after you've completed your workout.;  , If you typically just hit the treadmill and run at the same incline and same pace each day your treadmill routine can get a little boring. Try some of the other features on the treadmill, like increasing the incline, to make your treadmill workout a little more exciting.  You can run your whole routine on an incline or you can alternate between running at a flat level and then running on an incline. Since the incline is a little more difficult, you may need to slow down your pace a touch.  The incline is something you can do to spice up your routine, but using this feature can also produces some extra health benefits. Running on an incline helps burn more calories, can help prevent shin splints and can help increase speed and endurance., If you find yourself zoning out on the treadmill or getting a little bored with your run, try making treadmill games for yourself. You can make these games something you do on a regular basis or save them for times when you need a little change.  One game you can design for yourself is treadmill cards. Take four index cards and write on the front of each one. Write one of these words on each card: sprint, incline, side gallop (described in a later step) or jog. Pick cards at random every three or five minutes. You'll never know what's coming next.  You can also play 'trigger word' if you are watching TV while working out. Pick a word and assign that as your trigger word. Every time you hear that word sprint for one minute or run on an incline for three minutes.  If traditional running on the treadmill has got you a little burnt out, try other cardio moves instead. These new moves help challenge your body in new ways and train different sets of muscles.Do side gallops. Slow the treadmill down a bit. Face your body and feet sideways and rest your hands lightly on the handle bars — your right foot should be closest to the front of the treadmill. Step your right foot towards the front of the treadmill. Hop the left foot over to meet your right foot. Continue in this pattern for as long as you can and then switch sides.  You can also squat down a little bit in between hops to work out your thighs and glutes a little bit harder.  Incorporate high knees. Again, slow down the treadmill a bit to do high knees. Alternating sides, bring your knees up to your chest. Do this quickly so your heart rate stays elevated.  It's generally recommended to not only do cardio, but also participate in some strength training for a complete workout. Ditch the weight room and bring your weights with you on the treadmill.  There are a variety of strength training exercise you can do on the treadmill while you're walking. This can cut down on the amount of time you spend working out each day.Grab a pair of small to medium dumbbells (or a size that's appropriate for your fitness level). You can try: doing bicep curls, shoulder presses, lateral raises, and front raises.You can also try doing some leg strengthening exercises. At a slow pace, do walking lunges on the treadmill. This can help strengthen your thighs and glutes.  Make sure you're walking at a safe pace that you can lift weights, but maintain your balance as well. If you're going too fast or are not paying attention, you could trip.  Be cautious of your joints. Elbows and shoulders can be injured by carrying dumbbells for longer than you are used to. Count reps for each exercise and then put the dumbbells down to rest the arm and shoulder muscles before proceeding to the next exercise.  Many, many runners and other exercisers choose to listen to music during their workouts. Not only is it fun and motivating, there's some research to support the fact that listening to music can actually benefit your workout routine.If you sync your running pace with some music, you may actually notice improved endurance. Many studies show that when a runner syncs her pace with certain types of music, she can run longer and use less oxygen.Also, choosing a song whose beat is just a touch faster than your pace can help keep you motivated and even make you run a little faster. This is a good idea to try if you're looking to improve your pace.Some music apps will monitor your running pace and match your pace with the beats of songs. This can help keep you going as your feet match the songs you're listening to.  In addition to music, there are other things you can do while you're running on the treadmill. Many of these things help distract you mentally and can keep you running a little bit longer.  Download an audiobook. Audiobooks are a great thing to have on hand. They keep your attention as you follow a story line or plot and are great for longer runs.  Watch a good movie or TV show. Plan your treadmill runs around your favorite TV show or sitcom. This can help you focus completely on the TV and not on your running.  Read a book or magazine. If you're able to, try reading a book, newspaper or magazine while you're running. You can get distracted by pictures and story lines while you run.  The one thing about a treadmill run that can double as a 'pro' and a 'con' is the fact that you can see your progress on the screen or panel in front of you. Although you'll know exactly how fast you're running, it may drive you nuts during longer runs.If you have to put in a decent amount of miles on your treadmill, watching that clock slowly go up in mileage can be difficult. This is especially true if you're not focused or having a tough time distracting yourself mentally.  If you find yourself staring at the mileage clock or looking down at that panel every minute (even though it felt like 10 minutes), cover up the panel completely. Use your gym towel, shirt or a piece of paper to completely block the screen.  You may be less tempted to look at the panel and be forced to get yourself mentally focused on something else besides how far you've run.  Running on a treadmill can be difficult mentally. Some days the TV, your playlist or the other people around you aren't enough to distract your mind. When this happens, try focusing by doing a little meditation while you run.Come up with a mantra. A mantra is a short saying that is meaningful and motivating to you. If you can't get your mind off the treadmill, try repeating a personal mantra to yourself. It could be 'just keep running, just keep running, just keep running' or 'keep going, you got this.'  Focus on your breathing. Think about your breath. Are you breathing hard? Are your breaths short or are you breathing deeply? Try to concentrate on your breath-breathing in, breathing out, breathing in and breathing out.  You may also want to try to coordinate your breaths with your stride. For example, breath in every two strides and then breath out for two strides. This forced method of breathing may help slow down your heart rate which can help you last longer on the treadmill., To stay motivated and excited with any type of workout, try setting goals for yourself. This can help give you the encouragement to power through times of boredom with your exercise routine.  Your goals should be specific, timely and realistic. This will help make sure your goals are something that you'll actually meet.If you typically are exercising on a treadmill, make some goals related to running or your treadmill workouts. You can work towards being able to run longer distances, run at a faster pace or at a higher incline.  You might also want to consider making one longer-term goal and then have smaller, mini goals along the way to meeting that bigger goal., Another good way to keep yourself motivated and on track with your goals is by working out with a friend. It's fun and has been shown to be one of the best ways to stick to your workout routine.Many studies have shown that if you workout with a friend or a family member you're less likely to skip workouts or deviate from your goals.Your workout buddy provides a gentle coercion, can keep you feeling and thinking positively and may help you meet the goals you've set for yourself.Talk to your friends, family members or co-workers about working out together. Try to get someone to meet you at the gym, show up for an afternoon walk or take a walk break over lunch.  There's nothing more exciting than seeing yourself make progress with your goals. Write down your goals on paper and track your progress to help yourself stay excited and motivated with your workouts.  After you've thought about your goals and come up with some ideas, write them down in an exercise journal or planner. Getting them on paper can make them more real for you.You can also download a fitness app onto your smartphone and use that to track your progress.  Track your daily progress towards your goal. Write down what days you're working out, for how long and how your workout went that day.  In addition to your goals, note little milestones as well. For example, note the first time you were able to run three miles without a walk break.  Changing up your exercise routine is a great way to spice up your exercise plan and keep you focused and motivated. In addition, a change in exercise type can come with many other benefits.  Hitting the treadmill day after day can get old and boring. If you're feeling a little burnt out from the treadmill, try other cardio machines or try running outside.Even a few days or a week or two of something different may be enough.  In addition to preventing boredom, changing up your exercise routine helps improve your overall fitness level. Every time you do something new, you're continuing to challenge your body in a different way. This helps your body to continue to build endurance and strength., Another fun way to keep yourself motivated and working toward meeting your goals is by setting up some rewards for yourself. Even small treats can help keep you excited to continue working towards your goals.One way to get a very simple reward is by taking a few moments right after finishing a workout to savor how good you feel. Maybe you focus on your increased energy, happy feelings, proud feelings or how healthy you feel.  If you have one big, long-term goal, consider setting yourself up a bigger reward. Maybe you run 10 miles every week for a month or finally run five miles without stopping on the treadmill.

"The major reason for leaking bathrooms is poor waterproofing prior to tiling. This is especially the case for older homes where waterproofing products weren't as good as they are nowadays. However, it can still be a problem for modern homes if the application was sloppy.;  , Try to find which bathroom appliance might be the source of wet patches or drips (shower, bath, toilet).  Turn on each appliance in turn, checking the drips or the wet space to see if it worsens with any particular appliance.  Leaving water overnight in a shower pan or bathtub can help you to find a leak if one of these appliances is the cause. If there are no leaks, eliminate the bath or shower from the search. Be aware - a hole as small as a pinhole can cause a massive leak beneath!  Check the pipe between the valve and the shower head.  Usually there is ceiling space between the upstairs bathroom and the lower ceiling.  Cut a hole in the ceiling to enable you to undertake a visual inspection of the pipework to see if the pipes are leaking, or to see if there is direct leaking from under the tiles.  If you find leaking pipes, get the plumber as soon as possible. Unless you're fully trained in plumbing, leave this one to the professionals to fix. Having a plumber do an inspection will also help you to know whether or not you need to go to the expense and trouble of lifting off all the tiles and waterproofing and re-laying them!  ","check the waterproofing. run one fixture at a time. check the pipes. get a plumber. "
"There are a few symptoms you can look for to determine if you have high urobilinogen levels. Your urine will be a darker color while your feces will be lighter colored.Your skin and eyes may also have a yellowish tint to them.  If you have high levels of urobilinogen, you should go see a doctor. Elevated urobilinogen indicates there is a problem with your liver. Many serious and potentially fatal liver diseases cause higher urobilinogen levels, so you should see your doctor immediately.For example, you may have liver cirrhosis, liver cancer, or hepatitis.  If you believe you may have elevated urobilinogen levels, your doctor will recommend a urine test. You will be given a test stick that reacts to urobilinogen to determine if your levels are elevated. Then, if the test stick is positive, the doctor will perform a test to determine how much urobilinogen is in your urine.The doctor will probably also test your blood and liver function at the same time.

"It'll be easier to get a task done if you have all the supplies on hand to do it. Avoid wasting time looking for tools or documents by having them all accessible and organized from the beginning.;  , Even though you may just want to do this in your head, actually writing it down has a huge impact.  Try to be specific and reasonable. For example, don't write 'continue novel' or 'clean house.' Instead, write things such as 'write 500 words' or 'tidy the living room floor.' Small, achievable tasks are best. If you have a big goal in mind, try breaking it down into smaller steps on your list.  Don't get too distracted by the list. If list-making is taking more time than just getting down to work, put it aside and start being productive.  If tasks have a deadline, mark them on. This will help you in prioritizing.  Prioritize the tasks. A simple numbering system works well - you can decide to either prioritize the tasks that need to get done first, or get particularly hard/long tasks out of the way first. Alternative, you might even opt to start with a few shorter/easier tasks so that you can knock a few off the list quickly.  Shed light on the situation. If it is day, open the curtains. If it is night, turn on the brightest lights. This will have a psychological impact on you.  List all the advantages of completing the goal you have. Come up with as many things as you can. For example, if your goal is to make friends with a colleague, don't just say 'I will have a new friend.' Instead, advantages can include: I can meet people from their social circles; Our work can be more enjoyable; We can learn from each other; They may encourage me on days when I feel demotivated etc.  Tell people when you will be finished by. This is a very powerful tool for getting things done as it increases the pressure on you. Tell as many people as you can and emphasize how good your finished thing shall be.  Set rewards for yourself.  Open the windows if you can to let in fresh air.  Some people prefer to work in silence; others like to have music on. Also, find what type of music is best. While most find relaxing, gentle music best for homework, college assignments, etc; others don't. Most people find that the type of music varies from task to task (e.g. fast music for cleaning or relaxing music for paperwork).  Remember that you may not be able to play music for the task. For example, you may not be allowed to play music at work/school.  Try not to play music that you will be tempted to sing along with.  Distractions can include phones, emails, social media, family etc. Whatever is deterring you from working needs to be removed. If you are being distracted every 15 minutes, you will get little work done because it is impossible to get immediately back to work after a distraction. For most people this takes 5 - 10 minutes.  Consider letting your family members, coworkers/classmates, or housemates know that you're buckling down to work on something important, so that they won't distract you.  Many people believe that multitasking increases productivity, but the truth is tackling things one at a time will allow you to complete more in less time.  Break tasks into smaller chunks if needed. One huge job can seem overwhelming, but if you break it down into sections, it becomes more manageable. For example, 'write an essay' seems big, but if you start with 'brainstorm ideas' and 'write a topic sentence,' each part becomes a much smaller and more achievable goal.  As you do each task, check it off your to-do list. This feels great, and can motivate you to keep going down the list.  The breaks should be no longer then 8-10 minutes. During this time you should stretch and exercise a bit. This will help you come back to the task with more focus, and keep at it for a longer period of time overall.  In particular, drink lots of water. Your brain and body can only work properly if you are hydrated. While drinks and snacks can be distracting, they also help keep your energy up. If you're thirst or hungry, don't ignore these feelings - take care of them, and get back to work.  This may seem tedious, but a tidy space means a tidy mind.  This shouldn't be a problem if you've already removed the main distractions before beginning work, but if you hear your phone ring, or get a Facebook alert, ask yourself: is it worth breaking my work flow? If there's something urgent you need to take care of, do, but if it's something you can take care of later, wait for your break.  If you lose site of why you're working so hard, look back at your to-do list and try to refocus on your motivation. If needed, taking a few moments to re-adjust your mindset like this will help you stay on task.  Give yourself the rewards you had promised yourself. Be honest with yourself - if you do not complete the task, do not reward yourself.  ","keep possessions organized. make a list of all things that need to be done for the day, week, and month. find motivation. find out if music works for you. remove distractions. do things one at a time. take short breaks every hour. eat and drink as needed. keep your workspace tidy. resist distractions. remind yourself of the goals and rewards. reward yourself for a job well done.

"One way to spot symptoms is to simply be aware of the person’s behaviors when he eats. Try to understand your friend’s relationship with food.  Notice if the person eats large quantities of food even when he is not hungry.  Observe if your friend complains of a stomach ache or having eaten too much on a regular basis. This can be a sign of binge-eating.  See if the person self-medicates with food. People with eating issues may often use food as a way to feel better. Does your friend want to eat unhealthy when he is feeling sad or angry?  Notice if your friend never wants to eat around other people, or eats secretively. Does your friend hide food that he is eating so that others won’t see?  There may be a problem if your friend repeatedly makes excuses for not eating such as saying, “I’m not hungry,” very often.  Look for food hoarding. Individuals with eating disorders may hoard food out of embarrassment. They may stash food in a secret place to use for future binging.;  , Binge eating is one of the major symptoms associated with various eating disorders.While it is not necessary to diagnose certain eating disorders, it is very common.  Binge eating involves:  eating, in a discrete period of time (for example, within any 2-hour period), an amount of food that is definitely larger than most people would eat in a similar period of time under similar circumstances, and  a sense of lack of control over eating during the episode (for example, a feeling that one cannot stop eating or control what or how much one is eating).  To be classified as binge-eating, the person will experience at least 3 of the following: eating much more rapidly than normal, eating until feeling uncomfortably full, eating large amounts of food when not feeling physically hungry, eating alone because of feeling embarrassed by how much one is eating, or feeling disgusted with oneself, depressed, or very guilty afterwards.  Binge eating also causes emotional distress, and occurs at least once per week.  When individuals binge, sometimes they may engage in behaviors that help them feel better about the binge, or reduce the weight gain that might occur.  Purging is one type of compensatory behavior that is used to deal with the effects of a binge. This means the person purposely vomits in order to release the food out of his system. Notice if your friend goes to the bathroom repeatedly during or right after a meal. Listen for sounds of throwing up, using mouthwash, or brushing of the teeth (which will often occur after a purge).  Other compensatory behaviors include taking laxatives, diet pills, or diuretics as well as fasting or exercising excessively (several times or many hours per day).  ","observe signs of abnormal eating. look for binge eating. notice compensatory behaviors. "
"The person that is given the decision-making ability is the agent, also known as the attorney-in-fact. The person who gives up his ability to make decisions is known as the principal. A durable power of attorney can be used if the principal is unable to handle all or part of his affairs for a long period of time. You may also need a durable power of attorney if it is suggested that one is needed by the principal. A durable power of attorney goes into effect immediately. It continues to be valid when the person who asks for it is no longer able to make decisions.A general power of attorney does not remain in effect after someone is unable to make decisions for themselves. If the word durable is not specified, the power of attorney is voided when the person who granted it becomes incapacitated.  You can also get a springing durable power of attorney. This will not go into effect until the principal can no longer make his own decisions. With this process, the person must be proven to be unable to make his own decisions before the power of attorney will go into effect.You can create a durable power of attorney for health care, which grants the agent the full rights to take care of all the principal's medical decisions when he can no longer do it himself. This includes all medical decisions from going for a check up to surgery decisions. These are often accompanied by a Living Will.  You can also create a durable power of attorney for finances, which gives the agent full control over the principal's finances. This includes everything from opening the mail and depositing checks to filing taxes.You can also write a full durable power of attorney that gives all of the principle's rights away, both financial and health related, to one agent.;  , The simplest way to get power of attorney is to do so with the agreement of the person who may need to turn over his decision-making rights. If your loved one is terminally ill, a time may come when he won't be able to make financial or medical decisions. He may decide to willingly sign over power of attorney to you. If you know that your loved one might need to give you power of attorney, discuss it with him. Let him know you care and you have his best interests in mind.  Make sure he understands what it means to sign over power of attorney. This includes what types of decisions will be made for him.For example, a principle may want to draw up a durable power of attorney if he is diagnosed with dementia. In this case, the principal may want to set up a contract while he is still in a level state of mind and appoint his daughter as agent in order to protect himself in the future when he can no longer remember everything.  For someone to grant you power of attorney, the person must be of sound mind. If your loved one is not mentally sound, but has granted power of attorney to you in a Living Will, you don't need to file for power of attorney. If your loved one is not mentally sound and has not granted power of attorney, you may need to get adult guardianship, also known as conservatorship, to take care of his affairs.You must go to court to ask to be appointed as a conservator or guardian. To become a guardian of someone, the principle much first be labeled legally incompetent by the court. That is, he must not be able to meet his own basic needs.You need to go to the state circuit or district court of the county where he lives. These courts make the decisions for the guardianship of those that live in the area.  Your situation will be assessed based on your eligibility to serve as guardian, his inability to take care of himself, and the lack of other possible fitting options to guardianship., Someone you know may need to give you power of attorney for many reasons. He may want someone else to control his personal finances for a short time or for a long period of time after he is incapable of doing so himself. He may also want you to make health care decisions in the future. If someone you know is ill, or just getting older, he may want someone that he knows and trusts to be able to make decisions about the care he receives.  For example, Bob may grant a durable power of attorney for finances to his son, Jim, for the tenure of one real estate deal. Once the deal is closed, Bob's financial decisions belong to Bob again. However, Bob can also write a durable power of attorney for finances that will give Jim all the control over his finances if he happens to become incapacitated in an accident or because of a health issue.Some people also choose a power of attorney to have control over finances if they themselves have a spending problem. This gives the main control over certain aspects of his finances, such as a savings account or investments, to the agent.  If your loved one is giving power of attorney to you or someone else, you want to make sure that that he can trust this person. The agent should also have the necessary background and understand the situation she will be put in when the power of attorney goes into effect. Consider the age, health, and location of potential agents.  Keep in mind that the person appointed as the agent will be making extremely important decisions.  For example, if the agent does not live near your loved one, it may be difficult for that person to have the required relationship with his banks or his doctors.  The principal needs to consider the agent’s religion and lifestyle choices. Although he should, first and foremost, choose someone that he trusts, he also should make sure that the person that he chooses will not refuse to carry out his wishes based on her own moral or religious views. You would want to make sure that the agent could set aside any personal beliefs in favor of your wishes.  For example, some people are against using machines in hospitals to help keep someone alive. Some may also not believe in any resuscitation efforts, but others strongly believe in these things. You need to make sure the agent of the power of attorney is on the same page as your loved one and will make decisions according to his specifications.  Generally, you should help your loved one choose an agent that he can talk to about what he wants and who he thinks will follow his wishes completely.  Requirements for a durable power of attorney are similar in most states, but some have special forms to fill out. Usually, the document giving power of attorney must clearly indicate the person granting the power, clearly name the person who will have the specified powers, and specify exactly what legal acts the decision maker is entitled to perform.  You should research the requirements in your state.If your situation is complicated and you're unsure how to proceed, hire an attorney to help you and your loved one carry out the proper requirements for granting power of attorney.  In most states, the forms don't have to be government-written legal documents. To avoid any confusion and to make sure that everyone involved knows exactly what rights are being given, it's a good idea to use a state-issued form as a template. You can use a template of a state form to write your own power of attorney document.  You may be able to download a power of attorney form from various state websites, including departments of health, state bar associations, county bar associations or other agencies., The form should have the full names of both people involved in the power of attorney agreement. The first name and last name should be listed as well as any addition to the name, such as Jr. or III. The form should say exactly what rights the agent will take over. In a clear and specific manner, document the rights being granted to the agent; when those rights will take effect; and when, if ever, those rights will stop.  Make sure the form says whether the rights are springing durable or durable. You should also know which powers can't be given under your state's law. For example, an agent cannot draft a will for the principal under state law even if the power of attorney document grants that power.  For example, the person giving away his rights can specify in the power of attorney form that the decision maker will not have power over him until the principal is 75 years old, but once he reaches that age, the decision maker will have the specified powers, regardless of the principal’s capacity.  Alternate decision makers can also be named. This is in case the first decision maker is unable or unwilling to act on his authority., In some states it is necessary to have the signing of the document witnessed by one or two people. If this is the case in your state, make sure you have witnesses there when you and the decision-maker sign the document. Make sure that the witnesses watch you and your loved one sign the durable power of attorney document. If the witnesses don't pay attention, they will not be able to say that document is real if it is questioned.  For example, in Florida, a power of attorney document must be signed by two witnesses. In Utah, no witnesses are required. You should find out if your state requires witnesses., An attorney may notice legal issues that people who aren't trained in legal matters would not think to add or leave out. An attorney may see that the form uses wording that could been seen as open ended. This could lead to confusion. If the document is durable, it's important to make sure that both people are in agreement about what responsibilities and authorities are being given.  For example, instead of saying that the agent “has the rights to the principal’s finances,” say that the agent “has the rights to withdraw money and make payments from the principal’s three bank accounts: bank account X, bank account Y, and bank account Z.”  , Some states need the people involved to sign the document in front of a notary. However, even if your state does not require this, having the signature of the person giving away his rights notarized gets rid of any doubt about the validity of that signing. This is because the notary has to verify the identity of the people involved before he witnesses the signatures. Since this is the case, notarizing the power of attorney document reduces the chance that it will be brought into question by anyone who may have a problem with its validity., A power of attorney is not filed at any governmental agency. You need to have it on hand to show it every time you need to use it. You can get a safety deposit box that is accessible only by the decision-maker and someone else close to him. You can also keep it in a safe in your home. This way, the document will be safe until the time comes when you need to bring it out.

"You need to make sure your squirrel has a healthy, balanced diet. As squirrels are not traditionally kept as pets, this can be somewhat tricky.  Do not attempt to feed a baby squirrel on your own. Baby squirrels need specific vitamins and minerals. Feeding a baby squirrel formula or milk could result in the squirrel dying. Take your baby squirrel to a vet or wildlife rescue as soon as you can. The workers there will know how to feed him properly. In the event you take him back home with you, you can learn how to care for the baby online at TheSquirrelBoard.com. They do make specially designed food for squirrels. It can be tricky to find, however, as it may be sold at your local pet store. Some states do not allow people to keep squirrels as pets. You may be able to order squirrel food online, but it might take a few days. In the event you cannot get squirrel food quickly, TheSquirrelBoard.com has recipes to make temporary formula. , Keep a bowl of water in your squirrels cage or enclosure. Squirrels need plenty of water for their health and wellbeing. You can either leave water in a bowl or use a bottle, like you would in a hamster cage. If you're getting a bottle, make sure you use a glass bottle. Some squirrels chew through plastic.If you're giving water to a baby squirrel, make sure any bowls you use are not too big. You would not want a baby squirrel to accidentally drown in his water bottle. You can place rocks or marbles at the bottom and fill the bowl to just halfway up to the marbles so he doesn’t drown.  If you found a squirrel in the wild, he may be injured. You should carefully assess a squirrel for injury and get him veterinary care if you see any injuries.  Find a safe spot in your home with good lighting. Stay away from children or other pets. Wear heavy, protective gloves when handling a wild animal. You should also wear a long sleeve coat. If a squirrel has not been handled before, he may bite or scratch. If you are bitten/scratched, rabies is NOT A PROBLEM. Squirrels are cleaner than most other animals. Just rinse out the cut and go about your business. Keep a basin of warm water and a few clean washcloths on hand. Check the face, nose, and mouth for dried blood. If you see any parasites, like fleas or ticks, remove them. Parasites should be killed if still alive to avoid infecting other pets in your home. If you need to wash any blood, wring out the rag thoroughly and move it gently over the squirrel's fur.Pay attention to your squirrel's limbs. Lets and feet may be twisted awkwardly or limp. Baby squirrels are especially prone to injury from falling out of a tree or nest.If your squirrel is injured, contact a wildlife rehabber and/or vet IMMEDIATELY.  Squirrels need a lot of exercise. If you plan to keep your squirrel for awhile, you need to make sure he spends time building his muscles.  Allow your squirrel access to one room of your house for at least an hour a day. Make sure you remove anything breakable or anything you do not want damaged. Allow your squirrels to run, climb, and play in this room.Do not allow the squirrel outside without a cage. Hawks and other predators are faster than you and can make a meal out of the baby before you can react. Also, the baby may get spooked and run away, to never return, and thus die due to not knowing how to fend for himself. If you're keeping your squirrel longer than a week or so, install some perches in his cage. As stated earlier, bird perches work well for a squirrel cage. They should come with manufacturer's instructions for set up.  ","feed your squirrel a proper diet. provide plenty of water. check your squirrel for wounds and injuries. encourage exercise. "
"This is how much time you will need for the wine to cook., If you don't have any Merlot at home, or simply don't like it, you can use another fruity red wine, such as Cabernet Sauvignon or Zinfandel. Avoid anything too sweet, however.Use 100% orange juice, without any added sugar. You can also squeeze your own.  Wash and scrub the orange well. Poke the cloves, pointy-end first, into the peel. If the peel is too thick, you can poke holes into it using a toothpick or skewer first.  Use an organic orange if you can. You will be soaking it in the wine for several hours, after all., You can use fresh or frozen cranberries for this. Be sure to rinse them well, and to pick out any stems., You are ready to serve the wine when the cranberries turn tender. You can cook it for another 1 to 2 hours, but keep the heat on 'low' and don't let the wine come to a boil., Use a slotted spoon to scoop out the orange and cinnamon sticks. Next, place a strainer over a large bowl or pot, then pour the wine through it. Don't take the strainer off just yet., Be very careful. Some of the cranberries may burst and spurt hot liquid. Once you have smooshed all of the cranberries, take the strainer off of the bowl/pot and discard the skins., If it is not sweet enough, you can stir in some more sugar., Pour hot, boiling water into your serving mugs and wait 1 to 2 minutes. Pour the water out, then dry the mugs off with a clean towel. The hot mugs will help keep the mulled wine warm longer., Cinnamon sticks or fresh orange slices make great, simple garnishes.

"Cats easily pick up on human emotions. If you panic, your cat will become nervous, which will cause their blood pressure to rise. This can lead to more bleeding. On the other hand, keeping a cool head will allow your cat to calm down and cooperate with you., First, talk to your cat in a soothing tone and pet them as you normally would. This will work with your calmness to help your cat settle down. Then, secure them in a comfort bag. Make sure it's not too tight around the cat's neck.  If you don't have a comfort bag, you can wrap them in a towel and secure it with a clothespin. This will allow you to start taking measures to stop the bleeding., Readymade ice packs are usually too large for small feline noses. Take one or two ice cubes from your freezer. Place them in a plastic bag. Then, wrap the bag in a clean towel.  Place the ice pack on the bridge of your cat's nose. Make sure you don't cover your cat's nostrils. The cold temperature should cause the blood vessels to constrict and stop the bleeding., A nosebleed can stem from a number of illnesses or injuries. Medication could worsen your cat's condition. The only exception to this rule is if your vet has prescribed medication specifically for the nosebleed or its underlying cause., Find a clean and dry paper towel. Wipe away any blood from your cat's face. This will keep their airways clear and prevent them from swallowing blood. Make sure you use gentle strokes. If the nosebleed was caused by a cut in the nose, forceful strokes could trigger more bleeding., Nosebleeds in cats occur due to an underlying illness (such as an infection or leukemia) or injury (such as head trauma or a foreign body in the nose). Only your vet can make the proper diagnosis and take measures to cure the condition or keep it under control.  Depending on what's causing the nosebleed, treatments can range from simple antibiotics to surgery or a blood transfusion.  ","stay calm. keep your cat still. make an ice pack. apply the ice pack. don't give your cat any medication, unless prescribed. clean up the blood. seek veterinary help. "
"An easy way to meet other dogs in your neighborhood is to make sure you are out and about with your dog on a daily basis. If possible, try to keep a regular walking schedule so your new dog will become familiar with the canines and humans it sees out on its daily walk. Walking your dog regularly means you will run into more opportunities for your dog to socialize with its neighbors., When you are out and about in the neighborhood, it is important that you always have your dog on a leash. In most places and situations, the law requires you to keep your dog leashed. Having your dog on a leash means you can maintain control if you run into another dog. Keeping your dog on a leash will also prevent your pup from running away should he feel threatened by the presence of another dog., Before you allow your dog to meet another dog, you should first make sure that dog does not have a history of aggression. Try asking the owner if their dog likes meeting other dogs. If the answer is yes, then ask if their dog has any aggression issues. It is better to ask these questions up front than to learn the answers the hard way.Before you approach the other dog owner, try saying, “Hello! It looks like my dog might like to say hello to your dog. Is your dog aggressive?”  , You should never allow your dog to greet a dog without first asking the owner for permission. The world is full of friendly dogs, but it is also filled with dogs that can be aggressive and antisocial. For this reason, it’s important that you get permission from the owner before allowing your dog to greet someone else’s dog.Try asking, “Is it okay if my dog says hello to your dog? My dog is friendly.”  , It is best that you keep meetings with other dogs brief while you are out walking your dog in the neighborhood. Once you have acquired permission from the other owner, allow the dogs to sniff each other for a few moments. If your dog behaves well and refrains from lunging at the other dog or barking, praise your dog and then lead your dog away.  ","walk your dog daily. keep your dog on a leash. ask the other dog owner if their dog is aggressive. ask the owner for permission to greet their dog. keep the meeting short and simple. "
"Fill a pot or pan with water. Add a few squirts of mild dish detergent and/or a generous splash of vinegar. If you’re cleaning anything other than a copper pot or pan (or cleaning the outside of a smaller pot or pan), place the item in the water. Set the burner to medium heat and bring to a boil.For heavy build-up of crusted-on materials, substitute the dish soap and vinegar with a cup (221 g) or more of baking soda for a more abrasive cleaning agent.;  , Wait at least fifteen minutes once the water comes to a boil. Then remove the copper with tongs (or the item’s handle if it wasn’t submerged). Use any pointed tool (like a butter knife or screwdriver) to prod at the offending material. If it only seems marginally looser, put it back in the boiling water. Otherwise, set it on a heat-safe surface and wait for it to cool enough to handle safely., Once the crud gives way when you poke at it, switch to a brush, sponge, spatula, or similarly soft item to avoid scratching the copper. Use this to brush or scrape off the crud. For especially heavy build-up:Combine baking soda and just enough water to create a thick paste. Apply an even coat of this over the copper before you start brushing or scraping.  Repeat as needed, since heavy build-up may require a lot of elbow work, during which time the crud may dry and crust over again.  ","bring water and cleaning agent to a boil. test the crud’s bond. dislodge the crud. "

"Psychic mediums perceive spirits in other dimensions using one or more of the following abilities:  Clairvoyance. Clairvoyant mediums can see spirits, auras, objects and places that are not perceptible to others. People who have passed away may appear to them in visions, or they may be able to vividly sense a place to which they have never been. Psychic mediums see these visions with their third eye, located between the two physical eyes. Everyone has a third eye, but the average person's is closed or too weak to use.  Clairaudience. Clairaudient mediums can hear messages from the 'other side,' either physically or psychically. They can communicate with spirits that are thousands of miles away, or in another dimension altogether.  Clairsentience . Clairsentient mediums experience psychic communication through pure knowing. They get surges of knowledge given from the spirits, that they then interpret.;  , Everyone has some level of psychic abilities, which help us intuit other people's feelings and connect with our spiritual side. Consider the following questions to help you determine your level of psychic ability:  Are you a natural psychic medium? Some people begin seeing visions, hearing messages, or strongly feeling the presence of spirits from a very young age. They don't necessarily know what they are experiencing until they get older. The natural psychic mediumship is exceedingly rare.  Are you clairvoyant, clairaudient, or clairsentient? Perhaps you feel on the cusp of developing abilities in one of these areas. You're sensitive and receptive to feelings, emotions, and communications from others, and you've had experiences that you consider to be paranormal.  Are you interested in becoming a psychic medium, but have never had a paranormal experience? It's possible to work on particular skills and open up the possibility of flexing your psychic muscles. With some practice, you may be able to open and strengthen your third eye.  One of the best ways to figure out whether you have the capacity to become a psychic medium is to read accounts written by other mediums. Decide whether you recognize yourself in their stories and experiences. Learn as much as you can about the history and practice of psychic medium ship.  Read books by psychic mediums, and watch shows that feature them, to get a sense of the paths psychic mediums have taken.  Talk to a psychic medium about his or her experiences. Psychic fairs are good places to meet mediums.  Beware people purporting to be psychic mediums who may not be the real deal.

"Reusable bags are usually stored in the same manner and place as disposable bags. Open the body of your vacuum, whether it is a zip closure or plastic lid to find your reusable bag., Remove the bag from the vacuum chamber, keeping your hand over the hole that attaches to the vacuum itself. This will keep any stray dust from wandering out of the vacuum bag and spreading over the room.  Some companies recommend completing this exercise outdoors to minimize the amount of trapped dust and debris that is released upon opening the chamber.  Using a kneading motion starting from the bottom of the bag, dump out the bag’s contents, keeping the vacuum bag close to the trash receptacle. Keeping it close will limit the amount of dust that is released into the air, and will direct most of the waste into the trash., If your vacuum uses a plastic chamber to hold its contents, you can wipe it out with a dry or damp rag to remove any lingering dirt or debris. If your vacuum uses a reusable bag, you may be able to wipe down the exterior of the bag with a damp rag, or you may run it through a wash cycle. Refer to your owner’s manual for definitive cleaning instructions.You may also run a plastic canister under hot water to remove stubborn residue.  Once your bag has dried, replace it in the body of the vacuum, once again placing it into the vacuum the same way it was removed. If there were any parts that needed to be lifted, pressed, or removed, lift, press, and replace them as you install the freshly-emptied vacuum receptacle., Once you’ve finished replacing the bag or plastic bin, close your vacuum and check to make sure it is functioning properly with the clean bag.

"Identifying the type of broken car horn you have will help you decide how to approach the fix.  Many cars have 2 or more horns. If the sound of the horn is low when you press it, 1 or more of the horns has stopped working.  , The horn should resemble a fuse with wires coming out of it. To remove the wire connector, press down on the lower end of the connector and then pull the wiring out. Remove the mounting bolt and the spade lugs, which are attached to the wiring. Clean the components and then reattach them. Ask your helper to honk the horn again.  You may choose to replace the broken horn with the exact horn originally installed in the car or you may choose a universal car horn.  Read your owner's manual to find the location of your car's fuse box. Your owner's manual will also inform you of the specific fuse connected to the operation of the car horn.;  , You may also be able to remove the fuse with your fingers. Your fuse has failed if the metal strip inside it is broken.  You can purchase replacement fuses from an auto supply store. Install the appropriate fuse and then have your helper try the horn again.  A problem with the airbag can result in a malfunctioning horn. If the airbag has expanded, it may be interfering with the component called a clock spring that allows power to reach the horn button from the relay coil which connects to the horn itself.  If your airbag has expanded, a professional mechanic will need to remove and then properly reinstall the airbag. A mechanic can determine other possible issues with your horn if you have been unable to isolate the problem.

"Having a guiding principle will make all the rest of your decisions simple and easy. Are you hosting a themed dinner party, or a blow-out with all of your friends? Do you want something small and intimate or the big banger that no one forgets. Ask yourself what kind of party you want to host before doing anything else -- this will help you decide who to invite, what to buy, and what to prepare., When sending out invitations, assume everyone is going to say yes instead of inviting tons of people and hoping only a set amount can make it. You can always send out more invitations later. Asking for an RSVP is a great way to help you plan food, drinks, and party events.  Let people know if they can bring their families or friends with a 'plus one' or 'family and friends invited' attached to the email, card, or event notification.  Consider the type of party you want when sending invitations. If you want close conversation, you may want to limit it to 8-12 people. If you want a big, raging party you'll go much bigger.  If you're having a classy party, let them know that it is 'black tie,' or 'formal.' If it's a loose, casual party, you can tell them to 'come as they will,' or 'be ready to party.' Try and use language that conveys the type of party you want so that no one gets surprised.  For example, if you're throwing a Halloween party, most people appreciate knowing upfront if they should wear a fancy dress costume or not.  You don't have to be obvious with the dress code. Describing the party as a 'evening to catch up and share a nice dinner' clearly lets people know that they shouldn't wear glitter and a crop top, unless they want to., Don't give your guests any reason to think they're imposing or intruding on your life. If you don't want people in certain rooms, simply close the doors, and leave the rest of the doors open. Stock the guest bathroom with extra toilet paper, in plain sight, and make sure that there is a clean room where people can put their coats and other things. Finally, if you're using your own dishes, make sure they are all clean and ready to eat off of.  Make sure there is ample seating for everyone unless you're having a rave up dance party or an outdoor picnic party.  Decorations aren't required for a good party, but they help create the party atmosphere. If you're going to put them up, however, make sure they are up well in advance.  If you're throwing a big party, remove anything delicate or breakable in advance to avoid costly and embarrassing mishaps., You should have food out for the entirety of the party, especially if there is drinking involved. This can be simple, like bowls of chips and dips, cheese and crackers, and pre-made veggie plates. If you're hosting a meal, put out these little snacks to hold your guests over while the courses come out. Don't feel, however, like you need to cook all day to throw a great party. You can always buy pre-prepared foods or simple things that you just warm up in the oven.  Don't put out all of your food at once. Fill up a few bowls, then refill them as the party needs.  Anticipate any dietary restrictions in advance. If you're unsure, make sure you have a gluten-free, (like veggies or rice crackers) kosher food, halal food, and vegetarian substitutes available. Consider anything containing nuts is labelled for those with nut allergies.  If you're cooking, give yourself ample time to prepare, and always cook more food than you think you'll need. Plan for an extra 2-3 guests to prevent running out., If you're having a mixture of ages, a couple of sodas and juices should be with the alcohol. It is often best to have at least two types of alcohol available as well to accommodate different tastes, such as beer and wine, mixed drinks and champagne, beer and spirits, etc. Ice and lemon can be appropriate too.  Depending on the type of party, you may want to think about where the drinks go. It is often best to keep hard alcohol out of sight but accessible, with less alcoholic beverages like beer open and in plain sight to prevent over-drinking too early., At the end of the day, you'll realize you forgot napkins, the appetizers might burn, or you'll forget that you need to shower and get dressed as well! Take the stress off yourself by building in a nice little buffer between your first guest arriving and your final preparations. If you seem relaxed and together when the guests arrive, they'll be relaxed too.  ","figure out what type of party you want. invite your friends, making sure you only invite as many people as you can manage. let people know what to expect in the invitation, often with a dress code. clean the house thoroughly before people arrive if you are not hiring a venue. make sure you have enough food for the entire party if you are serving food. have a variety of drinks on hand. give yourself 1-2 hours more to prepare than you think you need.

"The doctor will probably rinse the socket for you when you are in the office. This may help alleviate pain by removing pieces of food or debris that could be irritating it or causing an infection. The doctor will likely explain how to continue flushing it yourself at home:You will probably receive a plastic syringe to use when rinsing the socket. Depending upon your situation, the doctor may tell you to use the syringe to flush the socket with water, salt water, or a special rinse.  Continue rinsing the socket until it has healed enough that food and debris do not get stuck in it. Meanwhile, you should continue with good oral hygiene, brushing at least two times a day.

"A mattress that is medium-firm will allow your spine to settle into a neutral position as you sleep. If you have a ruptured disc, you might want to stay away from an extra firm mattress. An extra firm mattress can be too firm, causing additional pressure on your spine.Avoid pillow top mattresses and materials like memory foam, which tend to be too soft for those suffering from a herniated disc.  For many people suffering from a ruptured disc, lying down is a painful experience. If you find lying flat to be too painful, consider sleeping in an adjustable bed. An adjustable bed can be adjusted to prop you up, possibly alleviating pressure and pain on your spine.If you have trouble adjusting to an adjustable bed, try sleeping in the adjustable bed for at least a few hours each night. Increase the amount of hours spent in the adjustable bed as you become more comfortable with it.  A chair that reclines can be a good place to sleep if you are suffering from a ruptured, or herniated, disc. Since a reclining chair props you up, it can help relieve some of the pressure on your lower spine. If you find other sleeping positions uncomfortable, try a chair that reclines.If you still want to sleep in the same room as your spouse or partner, try moving a reclining chair into the bedroom.

"'NO!' is read differently than 'No.' Be careful not to use excessively, however, or people will get annoyed.  You can occasionally use all lowercase text when implying a monotone in a short word or phrase, but it's used far less often than caps.  'Y-yeah, that's g-great!' seems more hesitant than 'Yeah, that's great!'. Use when expressing feeling passive, nervous, or awkward.  'Yeah, um, that's great!' is different than 'Yeah, that's great!'.  Depending on context, it could mean you're angry, unsure, upset, or anything else a pause could mean when speaking normally. 'Yeah... that's great...' has a different meaning than 'Yeah, that's great!'.  You can use 'What???' instead of 'What?', 'Yes!!!' instead of 'Yes!', etc. Don't overuse, since it can make you seem 'nooby', or newer and inexperienced with the Internet's culture.  You can also use an exclamation point and question mark together to emphasize a question. Put the question mark in front of the exclamation point or it won't look right. 'What?!' is distinct from 'What?'.  'I'm so thrilled for you.' seems opposite of 'I'm so thrilled for you!'.  'y34h wh4t 4 c00l 1d34!' is much different than 'Yeah, what a cool idea!'. Don't use this too often (as to not just be seen as annoying) and don't do it when mimicking your friends or they could get insulted.  Using some bad grammar/spelling phonetically while being sarcastic also helps get your point across. 'yah like wat a kewl idea' is very different than 'Yeah, what a cool idea!'.  'ohmygoshgoogleplusisout' is very different than 'Oh my gosh, Google+ is out!'.  'Whaaaaat?!' is different than 'What?!'.  They're generally pictures or animated GIFs of drawings or television shows where a character is showing an extreme expression, often with words on them. When saying what a reaction face represents, people often use '>mfw ____' (my face when ____) before inserting the image. For example, one could say '>mfw the storm knocks out the electricity' and then show a picture of an anime character rampaging.  Sparingly use reaction faces in places like chatrooms where people have to click on a link to see the face. That gets annoying.  Every once in a while, you can hit random keys on the keyboard to show frustration. The more keys hit, the more frustration it implies. 'Arrrgjkdfhldhbgfj my dog won't shut up!' is different than 'My dog won't shut up!'. Oftentimes, like in the example, 'arrrg' is added in front of the random characters.  Generally, these should be included outside the punctuation of the sentence. 'No, I didn't. *growls*' is more descriptive than 'No, I didn't.'. It can also show more personality through what you write.  Think about the tone of voice and everything else you would use to say what you're typing, and manifest it in what you're typing.

"Of course, you'll need a few cotton swabs. But other than that, there's no go-to set of ingredients that people use to clean their belly button . Rather, they use a whole host of items. Experiment for yourself what works best on your body. You can use:  Water  Baby oil  Hydrogen peroxide  Rubbing alcohol  Another kind of astringent, like witch hazel;  , Gently work your way around the belly button, being careful not to rub inside the navel too hard.  You should only need one or two takes and you're good to go. When you're done, take a clean swab and gently clean out any remaining cleaning solution still present in the navel. Make sure to get as much water, baby oil, hydrogen peroxide, or rubbing alcohol from your belly button as possible.  If your belly button is dry, use some Neosporin and you work your way around your navel. Use a slow, circular pattern and get right in the middle before removing the cream entirely with a swab.  It's a bad idea to take your piercing, if you have one, out every once in a while, because that is when most bacteria and other infection-causing things get in. Also, it can take as little as ten or fifteen minutes for a piercing to start closing up! Even if it isn't completely closed, it may be too painful for you to re-insert it. Do not remove a new piercing until you are sure it is fully healed, and there is no blood or pus coming from it, or crust on the jewelry. If your belly button is pierced, move it as high up as possible, soak it, then as far down as possible. Make sure you de-crust it, using a clean paper towel soaked in the saline solution, because it can cause pain if you try to slide it when there is crust present. Make sure you use SEA salt. Iodized (table) salt will do nothing for preventing infections! If you have an infected piercing, do not take out the jewelry. This can cause it to close with the infection inside, and it is not pretty. See a doctor. , Too much water and moisture can promote the growth of more harmful bacteria. Remember, your belly button is a haven for over 1,500 kinds of healthy bacteria— you don't want those interfered with by bad bacteria.  As long as you regularly bathe and use effective soap in and around your belly button, you don't have much to worry about. Your belly button, unlike your teeth, does not require constant supervision. Your belly button is like the brother who prefers to be left in his room for the whole day and prepares his own meals.  ","gather your supplies. dip one head of the cotton swab into whatever cleaning solution you want to use and start poking around in your belly button. discard old swabs and repeat the process if your navel is still dirty. if caring for a piercing, make sure to soak your belly button in salt water. make sure you dry your navel carefully after you take a shower. remember that you don't have to clean your belly button regularly.

"In order to extract orange oil in a jar, you will need a mason jar, a zester and some grain alcohol. Because it is largely tasteless, vodka works best for creating orange oil. It will not dilute or overwhelm the orange scent in the finished oil.  The essential oil in oranges, limonene, is largely found in the peel. Because of this, you will want to remove the peels from oranges before making your oil.You can either cut the peel from the orange with a knife or grind off the peel with a zester.For best results, avoid cutting off any of the pith. This part of the orange has very little limonene and will make your mixture bitter.  If you do not have a zester, you can also use a Microplane, a vegetable peeler, or a paring knife.  The amount of oranges used can vary. It depends on how many oranges you have or how much essential oil you want to make.  Once you have removed the peels, you will need to let them dry. Place them on a paper towel and leave them in direct sunlight until they are completely dry. Depending on the humidity in your area, this can take a couple of days. To accelerate the process, try chopping the orange peels into small pieces (1 in or 2.5 cm)., After the peels have dried, place them in a food processor. Grind them until they are a coarse consistency. Avoid overriding your peels. This can cause them to lose some of their limonene.If you used a Microplane or a zester, you will not need to grind the peels further.  Fill a bowl with warm tap water. It should be warm but not overly hot (around 90 degrees Fahrenheit or 32 degrees Celsius). Place the bottle of grain alcohol in the warm water and let it soak for about 20 minutes.Vodka works well for this process.  You can use cold alcohol. However, warm alcohol will help you get more oil., Place the zested or ground orange peel in a mason jar. Pour in enough alcohol to completely cover the orange peels. Once you have covered the grinds, secure the lid and vigorously shake the jar for several minutes., During that time, you may also want to shake the mixture two or three times a day. You may also consider letting sit longer than a few days. The more you shake it and the longer you let it sit, the more oil you will get from your mixture., Using a coffee filter or a cheese cloth, strain the mixture into a shallow dish. Be sure to squeeze all of the liquid into the bowl., Cover the bowl with a cloth or paper towel and let it sit for a few days. This will allow the remaining alcohol in the mixture to evaporate. Once the alcohol has evaporated, you will be left with orange oil.Do not let the towel fall into the mixture. It will suck up the oil.  Once the alcohol has evaporated, put the remaining oil in a container with a lid.  ","assemble your materials. remove the orange peels. dry the peels. grind the peels. warm the grain alcohol. cover the peels with warm grain alcohol and give them a shake. let the mixture sit for two or three days. strain the mixture. allow the alcohol to evaporate.

"A well-designed tablescape should be in dialogue with everything around it. When creating a minimalist tablescape, you should try to work with, rather than against, the primary color of the environment.For instance, if you have white walls – which are ideal for minimalist design – you could complement them with a set of navy napkins or a navy table runner.  If you have colorful walls, you might have a harder time finding a good way to achieve a minimalist tablescape. Focus on incorporating wood and white-colored elements into your tablescape.  Rustic-looking tables of unpainted wood tend to be favored in minimalist tablescapes. Ideally, the wood will be medium or light in hue, though darker woods can also work in the right environment (for instance, in a space where the walls are white)., Unlike a more traditional tablescape that might feature a big vase of flowers or a cornucopia, a minimalist tablescape should have just one single, clean-looking centerpiece. If you have a very long dining table – for a wedding, perhaps – it would be okay to incorporate one other repeated element that complements the plant. You could alternate the plant with, for instance, a series of white candles in clear glass.Take a long black serving dish and place a couple small bricks of floral foam in the bottom of the dish. Place a series of low cups – either plastic or clear glass – inside the dish. You should be able to get four to sit on the floral foam. The others can sit directly on the floor of the long serving dish. Stuff the cups with a lush green plant like selaginella until overflowing.  Other examples include a single white candle in a plain-looking copper candlestick holder, a succulent in a squat, black pot, and a single white rose or tulip in a small black or clear vase.  Make your centerpiece seasonal, if possible. For instance, in the fall you could choose a few small pumpkins or squashes.  A table cloth detracts from the color and texture of the table itself. If you choose to use anything, use a long runner – thin strip of cloth that goes from one end of the table to the other, and drapes down slightly over the ends of the table somewhat.  If you absolutely must have a tablecloth, select a white or light-colored tablecloth. If you can pull off a darker tablecloth – a navy, for instance – try it out. You can always remove it if you decide later it doesn't work.  ","let the walls determine the balance of colors on the tablescape. choose the right table. include a small centerpiece. don’t use a tablecloth. "
"These can often be written off as moving expenses on your taxes. This includes things like the cost of classified ads, supply costs for advertising a garage sale, and even your realtor fee.  It's likely that you have had many receipts for expenses associated with your home's sale. Keep these in a separate folder to prevent losing them., When moving for work, you can in most cases write these expenses off as well. Moving expenses, however, are slightly different from sales expenses. Some common examples of moving expenses include things like:  Transportation and fuel  Lodging  Meals (while moving), This may seem counter intuitive, but many of the tax rules surrounding moving deductions are complex. Working with an account will ensure you apply for all deductions available to you, which could end up saving you big time.  If you can't afford an accountant, the IRS provides diagrams and explanations at the IRS homepage to help determine your possible moving deductions., Some possessions might just not sell, even though they're in decent condition. Consider donating like-new and lightly used possessions. When you do, be sure to request a donation receipt.

"They should be about shoulder width apart.Lift your heels up off the ground.  Then push your heels back down onto the ground, bending your knees slightly.  Your hips will now come forward, followed by your ribs and chest.  This is one of the most important parts of this key dance move.If you don't roll your shoulders forwards and then look down, you aren't completing a full body wave.  This move is very fluid, and should be performed with the beat.  The next part is to reverse the move and return to starting position.  As you do this you should lift your heels off of the ground.Follow this by waving your chest and belly back.  Roll your hips back next.  Push your heels back to the ground.  From here, you can do this body wave move again or incorporate other street dance moves, like popping and locking, into your routine.Remember to have fun. Street dancing is a vibrant and energetic type of dance.  The order and sequence of your moves don't necessarily matter so much in street dance. Freestyling is preferred over pre-planned routines.

"To grow mold on bread you will need to collect the following materials: a slice of bread (any kind), a sealable plastic bag, a spray bottle, and water. You can use any type of bread, but know that store-bought sandwich bread contains preservatives and will take longer to grow mold. Fresh bread will grow mold faster.A spray bottle is not entirely necessary, but it is an easy way to evenly coat the bread in a fine mist of water.  Fill the spray bottle with water before beginning the experiment.  If you don’t have a plastic bag, you can replace it with some other sealable clear container. You want it to be clear so you can observe the mold growth and sealable to contain the mold. An old plastic or glass jar would also work.;  , Using the spray bottle, lightly spray the piece of bread with a coat of mist. You don’t want the bread to be soaked, you just want there to be some moisture to stimulate the growth of the mold. One spray is sufficient.Alternative methods for keeping the environment moist include:  Placing a wet paper towel in the plastic bag with the bread.  Sprinkling some water over the top of the piece of bread.  Spraying the inside of the bag instead of directly on the bread.  Place your moistened piece of bread into the plastic bag and seal it closed. For the remainder of the experiment you’ll want to keep this bag sealed to avoid exposing yourself to the mold spores that will grow on the bread.If you have allergies, you might not want to do this experiment as it may cause you difficulty.  Mold thrives in warm environments with moisture in the air.Find a warm place in your home and store the sealed bread here. You’ve already supplied sufficient moisture to the bread for growth.  Mold does not need sunlight to create food; it gets food from the bread itself. This is why mold often grows in dark, damp areas such as basements.  Make daily observations of your bread and track the growth of mold. It should take around 7-10 days before you will be able to see significant growth on the bread. You could see growth as soon as 5 days depending on the type of bread you used. Remember, fresh bread will mold faster than store-bought bread containing preservatives.If you notice the bread has dried out, you may need to add more water. If this is the case, wear rubber gloves and a mask to protect yourself from being exposed to the mold spores.  When you are finished observing the growth of the mold, dispose of the sealed container in the garbage. Do not open the bag. Opening the bag can release mold spores into your environment that are not good for your health.  Wash your hands every time after you have handled the bag.  To test various growth conditions for mold, you will need multiple samples. Moisten as many pieces of bread necessary to test your conditions. Place each one in a separate bag.  For example, if you want to test three different temperatures, make three samples.  Before each experiment, make some predictions about what will happen. Make a hypothesis about how quickly the mold will grow under each condition. Write down whether you think there will be more or less mold for each condition at the end of the experiment.  Keep all other conditions the same (temperature and amount of light), but add different levels of moisture. Have one slice with no moisture, one slice that is just damp, and one slice that is soaked in water.  Check the samples daily to see if the growth of mold is different between the three.  To test mold growth at different temperatures, store one sample at room temperature, one in the refrigerator, and one in the freezer.  Remember, to minimize variability, you will want to store the room temperature sample in the dark, as the samples in the fridge and the freezer will mostly be in darkness.Check each sample daily and see which piece of bread grows the most mold the fastest.  If you want to test whether or not light has an effect on the growth of mold, store samples in different light environments. Place one bag in total darkness and another bag in light.  Again, to minimize variability, make sure the temperatures of both environments are the same. If the temperature is also different, you won’t know whether the difference in growth rate is due to the light or the temperature.  Observe your samples daily to check for differences in growth rate and amount.  ","gather the necessary materials. spray the bread with water. seal the bread in the plastic bag. store the bread in a damp, warm area. observe the mold growth. dispose of the bread properly. make multiple samples of moistened bread. vary the amount of moisture on each slice of bread. place each bagged bread sample in a different temperature. store each bagged sample in areas with different varying light levels.

"Before you start moving anything around in the room, you should put together a mood board or an inspiration board. A mood board can be a collection of images from different sources, such as magazines, the internet, or even hand drawn sketches, that inspire you. You may structure the mood board around a theme, such as “punk rock” or around a certain color scheme or pattern. A mood board can be a great way to get inspired and form a clear sense of the style of the room.It may be helpful to also look online at design blogs that showcase teen bedrooms and style ideas. You may find a certain look or style based on images of existing bedrooms or a combination of two different approaches.  Try to integrate your hobbies and interests into the design of the room. If you are into a certain sport, like skateboarding for example, you may try to include skateboard images in the room. If your favorite color is blue, you may include different shades of blue in the room.It’s important that you and your parents agree on the overall style of the room and have a unified sense of how the room will look. Though your parents may be helping you to transform the room, you will ultimately need to live in it and you should have a major say in the design choices for the room.;  , Once you have decided on a theme or a certain style for the room, you should draw a rough floorplan of how you would like to rearrange the room. This could be a rough sketch of where key items, like the bed, the desk and the bureau are going to be placed in the room.You should also consider if there is enough storage in the floorplan for your clothing, your personal items, and your school books, and that there is a designated work space, especially if you tend to do your homework in your room.  Making a floorplan can also help you get a better sense of how to best utilize the space, such as ensuring the bed is in a spot that gets lots of sunlight or the desk is in a spot where there are limited distractions or close to a window.  One of the biggest design choices you will make is paint wall colors, as paint can make a big statement in a room. Use paint swatches from your local paint store to decide what colors may look good in the room or fit with your theme. Make sure you try out the colors on the wall before you buy enough for the entire room to avoid choosing the wrong color.If you are trying to create a relaxing space, you may suggest neutral tones like white, gray, or beige. You can then add pops of color with accessories and furniture.  If you’re going for a more bold look, you may want to consider interesting contrast colors like yellow and black or red and gray. If your are into art and drawing, you may create a blackboard wall in the room, where one wall is painted with blackboard paint that can be drawn on with chalk., Another big design element is lighting, as lighting can make a big impact in a room. Maybe you prefer ambient lighting in the form of cafe lights or an overhead light with a dimmer option.You may also decide to include a desk lamp if you tend to study or read in your room and do not want to have to strain your eyes.  Go through the furniture in your room and consider what you’d like to keep and what you’d like to sell or donate. Remember that you can update your existing furniture with fresh paint or new drawer knobs. Updating furniture can be a fun way to personalize your room.  Once you decide which furniture you’re keeping and which furniture you’re replacing, you should arrange a donation run with your parents to get rid of the furniture you do not want or post the items online to try to sell them.  You may also want to take a look around the rest of the house for other furniture or items that may fit in your new room. If there is a pile of old furniture in the attic or the basement, dig through it for any furniture that may suit your room makeover.  Based on your floorplan and your mood board, you should be able to make a list of all the new furniture items and accessories you need to buy for your new room. If you are on a budget, you may try to find certain items online or at garage sales. You may also go to discount furniture stores and shops that sell affordable accessories.  Your shopping list may include big items like a bed or a desk, and accessories like new bedding, pillows, storage options like shelving, and frames for photographs or posters. You may want to enlist the help of a parent when you go shopping, especially if you do not drive and need to get around in a bigger car to pick up the necessary furniture and accessories.  Once you’ve decided on your paint colors, you should prepare the room for painting. This means taking all the furniture out of the room so it is empty and the walls are easy to access. Cover any remaining furniture or items in the room with sheets so they do not get splashed with paint. You should then cover the corners and edges of the walls with painter paint so the paint only gets on the walls and not the ceilings, moldings, or the floor.  Before you paint the walls with your chosen wall color(s), you will need to prime the walls with primer paint. Once the primer paint dries, you can apply one to two coats of your chosen wall colors.  You may want to throw a paint party with a few friends and work on painting the walls together. Reward your helpers with pizza and your undying gratitude for helping to make the painting process go by much faster.  Allow the wall paint to dry completely, usually overnight or a couple of days depending on how many coats of paint you have applied, and then move in the lighting and the furniture. String cafe lights along the ceiling if you decided on a more ambient look or set an overhead light on a timer. You should make sure you have a good desk lamp for when you do homework or read.  As well, you should ask your parents or a friend to help you move your furniture into your room, including your bed, your desk, and your bureau. If you decided to replace your bedding so it’s more age appropriate, you should switch out the bedding to see how it fits with the rest of the room.  Make sure your storage options, such as wall shelving or storage lockers, also fit well in the room and are convenient for you to use. Usually, the more storage options you have in a room, the better.  Adding personal details like photographs, posters, and other visual mementos can really make your room feel special and unique to you. Consider hanging up photographs of friends and family in your room, or a picture of a person you admire or respect. You may also hang an inspirational saying or a funny quote that you love.You can frame and hang these pictures in simple frames on one wall to create a fun visual display or blow up on photograph to create a statement piece. Try to focus on images that have some meaning or value to you as you may be staring at them day in and day out.  If you are looking to create personal touches on a budget, try a small DIY project like a terrarium or a fun project with washi tape. There are many DIY blogs online with lists of easy projects that you can do on a limited budget.Enlist the help of your friends or a parent and do a DIY project together. This can be a fun way to hang out and also create unique accessories for your new room.  Though you may be tempted to throw away every item from childhood in your quest to have a teen appropriate room, consider saving certain sentimental or prized items like childhood medals or trophies. You may have an item given to you by a loved one that you treasure or an accessory gifted to you by a friend that you value for sentimental reasons. Including these unique items in your new room can make your room feel every more unique and specific to you.  To really elevate your room make over, you may want to consider adding in one fun and interesting element to your room, such as paper lanterns, a great mural on one wall, or a cool vintage sign from a flea market. Statement pieces that are singular and special can really make your room feel more grown up but still interesting and particular to you.Avoid adding in too many unique elements in your room makeover, as too many big, fun statement pieces can make the room feel chaotic or overwhelming. Stick to one unique element so the room feels cozy and interesting, but not overdone or cluttered.

"By briefly cooling the inside of your pan, you can help regulate the temperature of the milk more carefully, preventing it from heating too quickly on the stove.  Measure out the precise amount of milk you need for the recipe, since it will be difficult to add more later. You also should not use more than you need since you should not return scalded milk to the container of un-scalded milk it originally came from.  A low heat setting may not provide enough heat to actually warm the pan up, but anything stronger than a medium heat setting will likely bring the temperature up too quickly, causing the milk to boil and burn before you have the chance to stop it. A medium-low heat works best, but a medium heat can also be used as long as you keep a steady watch of it.  To prevent the milk from thickening or burning and sticking to the bottom of the pan, frequent stirring is vital. Do not allow the milk to rest for more than 30 to 60 seconds at a time as it heats up.  Do not allow the milk to start boiling, however. Once the milk has started to boil, it has gotten too hot, and a certain protein inside the milk may be destroyed as a result. The destruction of this protein could lead to a loss of volume in baked goods. Additionally, once milk has gotten hot enough to boil, it is nearly impossible to stop it from sticking to the bottom of the pan and creating a burnt film.  Lift the pan off the stovetop and transfer it to a heat-resistant surface. You can transfer the milk to a room temperature container to prevent it from continuing to cook, or you can simply keep stirring it until it stops steaming. Most recipes suggest that you allow the milk to cool to a certain temperature before you use it, so you should check the milk periodically with a thermometer until it reaches this temperature.  ","rinse a heavy saucepan with cold water. pour the milk into the saucepan. slowly heat the pan of milk over medium-low heat. stir the milk continuously. watch for the formation of steam and bubbles.the milk is heated enough to be considered scalded once small bubbles start to form around the edges of the pan. remove the milk and let it cool.

"Does she seem like she wants to keep the conversation going? It's a good sign for you if she does.  Is she asking you a lot of questions? Are they deep and personal? If the answers are yes, she probably wants a more intimate connection with you.  Are you making her laugh? Laughing at your jokes (especially if they are not very funny) is a way that women flirt.  Is she trying to keep the conversation going by being the one to ask questions or lead or direct the conversation? That's a good sign. It's a bad sign if she lets the conversation wither into silence between you or you feel like you're doing all the heavy lifting to keep it going.  There are some techniques you can use to build sexual tension, while monitoring how she responds and communicates back.  Move close to her and touch her, either her hands or legs. Slow down your breathing and words.  Look at her right eye. Hold the look for a few seconds, then move your gaze to her left eye. Pause again. Now, move your gaze and hold it on her mouth. She should be more receptive to a kiss (as long as she hasn't moved away!) , Women you've just met will often give you a short window of opportunity for a kiss. This can be a tricky balancing act. This will be easier if she's already your girlfriend because you will be able to spot the signs more readily.  A woman you've just met is also testing you. You need to give her signs that you like her when she seems receptive to you, otherwise she may feel rejected or insecure and start to pull away and try to make you chase her.  If you miss the window of opportunity, she may think you lack confidence or aren't interested in her. But if you try to kiss her before it opens, she might think you're boorish or too aggressive. So monitoring body language matters.  You should always be prepared for the worst: What if you try to move closer or touch her slightly, and she moves away? Maybe she's just tired or not in a good mood. Who knows? You don't want to make it worse with a bad response. Timing is everything.  Act like nothing has occurred. Basically, show that you're not thrown off. You could even make a confident quip about her being cute when she's shy.  Don't act angry or insecure. That's not appealing to women. Maybe she's interested in you but just not ready for a kiss yet. In that case, you could work on building more common ground and intimacy- slowly. Abandon your idea for a kiss right now and instead focus on having a great conversation with her, and remember to throw in some compliments! (Women love that.)  ","consider how she talks to you. try the triangular kissing technique. spot the window of opportunity. handle her moving away. "
"Vegetables with very healthy glycemic indexes include asparagus, spinach, broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, leafy greens, onions, peppers, and beans.;  , Whole grains are better than refined grains; that means you should opt for whole wheat bread instead of white or Italian bread, brown rice instead of white, veggie or whole wheat pasta instead of plain pasta, oatmeal instead of sweetened breakfast cereal, and so on.  Lean protein cuts are best for everyone, but it is also important to eat lean protein prepared in safe ways for diabetics.

"By improving your eating habits, you will decrease your body fat and fatigue, while gaining muscle and endurance. Not eating right could be what is holding you back from breaking your 800m record.  Eat a variety of wholesome foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean meats.This will improve your body composition. Increase protein and the right amount of carbohydrates, as these will provide your body with the nutrients to build muscle and to give your body energy.If you’re training for 30-45 minutes, shoot for about 3 grams (0.11 oz) of carbs on training days.  If you’re training for 46-60 minutes, shoot for about 5 grams (0.18 oz) of carbs on training days.  Avoid processed high-sugar and high-sodium foods. These will hinder your body from running efficiently.  Eat the right pre and post-workout carbohydrate-rich snacks. These should be consumed an hour before working out and within 30 minutes after a workout. Bananas, protein shakes and non-caffeinated energy bars are ideal.;  , Your body needs about two liters on an average day to stay properly hydrated.On days when running, you need to drink extra water to compensate for your output and prevent yourself from slowing down. Don’t just chug extra water though; listen to your body and drink when thirsty.  Pre and post-workout hydration is vital. An hour before you start your run, try to drink about 16 ounces (450 g) of water. Drink the same amount of water after running.  Look for signs of dehydration. Feeling thirsty or experiencing dry mouth, headaches, light-headedness, lack of urination and constipation are all the body's ways of letting you know that you are dehydrated.If you begin to experience any of these symptoms, it's best to increase your water intake.  By stretching properly, you can improve your stride and your stride length (increasing your speed). Stretching before and after your workout will also help to prevent injury.Muscles to stretch include your leg muscles (hamstrings, quadriceps and adductors) and your lower body (hip flexors and glutes). Try to add two or three longer stretch routines a week to your workout schedule.  Do some yoga to help you with your flexibility.  You won’t be able to run a faster 800m in one day. Just like training for a marathon, the best way to achieve your goals is to set a schedule. By following a training plan you can perform at a peak performance, even when running a shorter distance.Set an end date and work backward. Even with an 800m run, pick a date that you want to accomplish this run with your best time ever.  Do one or two quality and intense workouts a week. These include running hills or tempo runs.  Pick rest days where you can do some other sort of moderate exercise like yoga to stay limber.  These rely on the runner being able to maintain a fast pace throughout the race and then being able to sprint in the last stretch. Working out is going to require you to hone in on the following three abilities:  Develop middle-distance running mechanics. This is also known as speed-stamina. You're going to need to establish a fast pace for the beginning of the race while maintaining control of your body. The goal is to be able to maintain a comfortable, but fast pace throughout the run, keeping in mind that you will exert a lot of energy in a full sprint at the end of the race.  Learn to run in runner traffic. People who run an 800m race will have to deal with runner traffic on the inside of the track. Train yourself to minimize being caught in the pack by running in groups to learn how to be conscious of your running form without clipping the person in front of you.  Run anaerobically. The last half (350-400 meters) of the race, your body will often feel fatigue from your almost sprint-like speed. Build this ability by sprinting 400m at a faster than normal pace; then walking for 2 minutes before repeating. This interval training will improve your anaerobic fitness.  Run most days, alternating 400m and 1600m distances.  Focus on what attributes best match the 800m. Use the 400m to develop speed in sprinting. Use the 1600m to develop a high-speed endurance pace.  Refer to your training schedule. Remember to take rest days to stretch and continue eating a healthy diet to fuel for your next run. Also go on runs that will train your body in different ways, like hill running to improve leg muscles and cardiovascular strengthening.  Always follow hard days with easier days. After a hard workout, give your body time to recover by either resting or doing a lighter workout.  While you typically want to be somewhat active on rest days, you also need to allow your body to truly rest. This means that you get enough sleep and keep a consistent sleep schedule.Don’t run on an injury. If you experience an injury, stop training, and see a doctor so you don’t injure yourself further.  An hour before the race, have a high-carbohydrate snack and 16 ounces (450 g) of water.  You want to give your body the right nutrition to energize, but you don’t want to overdo it by eating too much. Before running, eat a snack instead of a whole meal as that means fewer calories your body has to try and process during your race.Consider fruit or yogurt, or a cereal bar to give you energy without making you feel bloated and sluggish.  Make sure that your body is loose and ready to run.  With a quick, proper stretch, you can loosen up your muscles and increase your stride while decreasing risk of injury and cramping during your run.  Stretch your hip flexors, thighs, hamstrings, calves, and lower back., A basic rule in middle distance races (800 and 1600 meters) is that a runner must maintain a fast pace and maintain enough energy to have two bursts of acceleration.  Start of the race off right. Run fast at a speed that you can maintain well. Consistency is key here.  Be smart in the middle of the race. Be conscious of the other runners and your changes in pace. You will need the energy to sprint at the beginning and end of the race. Use the first acceleration to merge into the inner lanes and get as close to the front of the pack as you can.  Be conscious of when you are over exerting yourself so that you have enough energy for the second acceleration at the end of the race. You want to maintain a consistent pace until it’s time to accelerate; don’t let other runners affect your pace.  In the last 200m or 300m, begin to sprint at full pace. This is where the anaerobic training comes in. Push your body, using your last acceleration to pass the pack leaders and win the race.  Properly cooling down after your run is just as important as your training. A proper cool will prevent injury and help ease your body back into a normal state.Walk for a couple of minutes, starting at a brisker pace then transitioning to a slower walk to allow your heart to ease back into its normal rhythm.  Stretch again for 5-10 minutes to ensure that your muscles don’t tighten up too much from working so hard.  ","eat the right diet. keep properly hydrated. stretch properly. set a training schedule. understand the mechanics of your run.the 800m run is a middle-distance race. run often. rest and recover. hydrate and energize your body. stretch your muscles. run your 800m. cool down.

"The jury is still out. More people win via quick picks (in Powerball)-- but more people use quick picks. Statistically, the odds are the same that any combination of numbers will be picked. So, it doesn’t matter if you choose lucky numbers or let the machine choose for you.Though it may seem illogical, 1-2-3-4-5-6 is just as likely as a random selection of 6 numbers.  The only drawback of self picks is that humans are all generally programmed the same. That is, your favorite numbers are probably someone else's favorite numbers. So, if you win on 7-14-21-28-35-42, you may have to share.  Richard Lustig, 7-time lottery winner, highly advises against quick picks.He argues that picking your own numbers keeps you from getting combinations of recent winners (so long as you've done your research!), thus increasing your chances..  If you are playing your state's lottery, don't bother checking to see if old winning numbers are available online. Just because a number recently came up, that doesn't alter the odds of it coming up again. Today's randomly selected numbers aren't affected by any other day's randomly selected number.  ","weigh your odds. "
"On the outset, porn seems like the perfect career for adventurous, sexually-active actors. You get paid to have sex almost every day, and the pay is actually pretty good once you get started. But porn comes with a series of risks as well, and they may outweigh the perceived benefits. Things to remember include:  Your image, once filmed, will be online forever, even if you try and switch careers.  You need to take the time every day to stay in shape, eat well, and keep clean and hygienic.  You are not having sex for fun, you are doing it for your job. Expect the intimacy and spontaneity of sex to disappear during a 4-hour video shoot.Maintaining a committed relationship while in porn can be almost impossible, as jealousy is only natural.;  , This is a heavily enforced rule in the porn industry because breaking it can lead to years of prison and hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines. Even if you are a consenting, willing participant, you must be 18 to be in porn in the United States.You must bring proof of age (valid passport, ID, etc.) to with you to a shoot in order to act. Producers are required to copy this proof and keep it on record for years., The average rate for a straight porn star in Brooklyn, NY, is $500-600 for one video shoot. Gay porn stars, however, make three times that, no matter the gender. The general rule of thumb is that the weirder it is from “average,” the more you will get paid. So a straight, guy-girl scene might make $800 while an intense bondage or novelty scene can make $2,000 or more.The average female porn star averages $50,000 a year, but can make upwards of $350,000.  Top male performers can make more than $100,000 each year, but average far less., Strictly speaking, it is only legally possible to make or act in porn in Los Angeles and New Hampshire.That said, most videos are not location specific, making it impossible to determine where it was shot, so producers will often make videos anywhere. There is a porn industry in many major cities, but to have the best chance of breaking in you need to move to LA. Some major hubs include:  Los Angeles, San Fernando Valley, California. This is the porn capital of the world.New York City, New York  Orlando, Tampa, and Miami, FloridaSan Diego and San Francisco, CA  Portland, OR, The porn industry is inundated with young talent that flocks to Los Angeles hoping to make it big. The sad reality, however, is that not everyone can be a well-known, marketable star in any industry. If the only reason you want to be in porn is to be famous, pulling in a six-figure salary every year, you will be sorely disappointed. The porn industry is at its most competitive thanks to the explosion of internet porn, so be ready to work hard to make a name for yourself. Porn is not a lavish lifestyle, it is a job, and you need to treat it as such.  While no one should ever force you to do something, having wider preferences and being willing to try more things will lead to more gigs and greater success.  ","ask yourself if porn is the right industry for you. remember that you must be 18 years old to act in pornography. know how much you will be paid. know where porn is made. know that it is very hard to become a porn 'star.'

"The quickest way to start volunteering is to go to the candidate’s webpage and sign up. A lot of campaigns even allow volunteers to phone-bank remotely, so you can get started almost immediately.If primary season has passed and you don’t live in a swing state (a competitive state), then remotely phone-banking might be the only way you can actively volunteer.  Don’t be the person who signs up to volunteer and gives no contact information. The campaign has to be able to contact you in order to schedule for events.  The most basic way to volunteer is simply by showing support--advertising which candidate has your support. There are several ways you can do this, including wearing a t-shirt, putting a bumper sticker on your car, putting a yard sign in your front yard, or sharing news stories, memes, and campaign ads on social media.  These are the easiest ways to volunteer, but make no mistake, they are also the least effective. Yard signs don't even move the needle by two percentage points, bumper stickers do even less, and 'sharing' things on social media is mostly preaching to the choir. These things might make you feel better, but they don't do much else., If you want to help in a more hands-on way, go to a campaign office in your area. If you live in a swing state, there’s probably going to be a campaign office nearby. You should be able to locate one on the candidate’s website. If you live in a non-competitive state, there will probably only be offices there during primary season., No matter what you do for the campaign, the campaign will typically need to give you minimal training before you get started. Schedule a time to come in and get trained.Campaigns need people to convince other people to vote for them, which means that the primary volunteering needs are in door-to-door canvassing and phone-banking. There’s not too much envelope stuffing that goes on anymore.  If you want to really help with the campaign, pitch in where you’re needed. If the campaign needs people to phone-bank one week and needs people to knock on doors another week, be flexible.Although campaigns can seem chaotic, there’s a method to the madness. Local campaign staff often have directives from the higher echelons of the campaign directing them to make calls to build enthusiasm for certain events or knock on doors to get out the vote.  Volunteers can be very unreliable. They show up late, not at all, or on a completely different day than they said they would. Presidential campaigns are major undertakings--a mass movement constructed in a manner of months--reliability is key.  In fact, this is so common that campaigns have a term for it—the “flake rate.” The flake rate is about one in three in a conventional campaign, meaning that one out of three committed volunteers will not show. Just be considerate. If you won’t show, call and let someone know.  ","sign up on the candidate’s webpage. show your support. find a campaign office. come in for training. work where you are needed. don’t be a flake. "
"The nutritional needs of your cat will change as they grow and age, so you should change their food when they are making a life transition. If your kitten is becoming a cat or your adult cat is becoming a senior, you should choose a food that is appropriate for their new stage of life.Depending on their health and preferences, you may also want to switch between brands of cat food or between dry and wet varieties of food.;  , Instead of suddenly changing your cat’s food, you should mix their old with their new food. Continue to serve the same size portions but include some new food alongside the old recipe, so that your cat gradually gets used to the new taste. Gradually increase the amount of new food you give your cat., The first rule of transitioning to a new food is to do it slowly. Gradually mix more new food into your cat’s regular, old diet. You could try the following seven-day transition schedule:  From day one to two, give your cat one quarter new food and three quarters old food.  During days three and four, give your cat half new food and half old food.  From day five to six, give your cat three quarters new food and one quarter old food.  On day seven, give your cat a portion of entirely new food.  Cats older than nine years of age are considered senior.If your cat is senior, you may want to try a longer, ten-day transition schedule:From day one to three, feed your cat a portion consisting of three quarters old food and one quarter new food.  From day four to five, give your cat a portion with fifty percent old food and fifty percent new food. Watch for signs of difficulty such as an upset stomach. If your cat is having trouble, go back to the formula for days one to three for a few days and then continue with the schedule.  From day six to nine, feed your cat a portion containing three quarters old food and one quarter new food.  On day ten, give your cat only the new food.  During the transition process, look for signs that your cat is having trouble with the new food. If they are experiencing any minor symptoms, you should give them a longer period to adjust to the new food. However, if the symptoms look serious, you should take them to the veterinarian. Look for the following symptoms:Soft stool  Vomiting  Diarrhea  Loss of appetite  ","pick cat food based on life stage. mix the old with the new food. follow a seven-day transition schedule. use a ten-day transition for older cats. look for signs of difficulty and adjust accordingly.

"If your parents get up early, try to get up with them. Suggest going for a walk. You will all get your day off to a good start, and have time to talk with each other about your plans for the day.  Ask them about their plans for the day too. Don’t spend the entire time talking about yourself. Express interest in their daily lives as well.;  , If possible try to have dinner with your parents most nights. Like taking a morning walk, having dinner gives you a chance to enjoy a meal together and talk about your day.  When your parents ask about your day, don’t be short with them. For example, if they ask you how school was that day, don’t just say, “fine”. Give them details about why it was good or bad. Talk about something interesting you learned, or something funny that happened during the day.  This is a very small step, but can mean a lot to your parents. Simply telling them that they are important to you, and that you appreciate all the things they do for you can really have an impact.  After your parents return from work, they are likely to be quite tired. You can offer to bring them something to drink, make them a snack, or even rub their shoulders and/or feet. Even if your parents don’t work, this is still a nice gesture, especially if you can see that they are stressed or worried about something.  Sometimes it is hard to talk to our parents about things because we think they won’t understand. However, if there is something bothering you or something you are worried about, talk to your parents about it. Not only will this make them feel like they are being included in your life and that you trust them, they may also be able to offer suggestions and advice you hadn’t thought of.  ","get up early and go for a walk with one or both of your parents. have dinner together. tell them you love and appreciate them. offer to make them a snack or rub their shoulders. be honest with your parents.

"It needs to be on in order to do a hard restart. Locate the power button on your Xbox One and press it to turn it on.;  , This action will turn off the system.  This will turn on the system, and you will see the green start-up screen. When making a hard restart, all data is preserved but the cache is deleted. This should fix the freezing issues.

"Your opponent may get the wrong impression of you if you exhibit aggressive body language. You could come off as mad or even snobby if you aren’t mindful of what you are doing.  Crossing your arms, pursing your lips, and slouching could give you an angry appearance, even if you aren’t. Instead, stand straight up, place your arms in a neutral position, and keep your face relaxed.;  , Laughing during an argument sounds counterintuitive, but it can actually help you to calm down and stay in control. Plus, cracking up releases hormones in the body that prevent you from feeling extra stressed.  For instance, you might say, 'Whoa, the tension in here is so thick, I could spread it on my toast.'  Consider who you are arguing with before you pull out the comedy routine. Your goal isn’t to make anyone more upset. Rather, it’s to calm down a tense situation., You feel your stress level rise and you want to be heard, but resist the urge to get loud. Yelling causes you and the person you disagree with to both become upset, potentially unnecessarily.  Instead, think about how you would want the opposition to speak to you. Then do your best to communicate in that manner, even if the person is yelling at you., It’s natural to feel attacked when someone seems to point the blame at you. Your first instinct is to become defensive and instantly stressed. Stop this from happening, and keep yourself calm by choosing words that lessen the feelings of being accused.  For example, say “I would like you to stop disrespecting me” instead of “You always disrespect me.” Using “I” statements allows you to get something off of your chest without directly putting the blame on someone., Ask yourself if the disagreement is really worth getting upset about. Chances are, it is not. Keep this in mind when you start to feel your temper rising. It can help you prevent the situation from getting out of hand.For example, if this argument isn't really going to change how you feel about the other person, don't let it. Remember that you care about them, and this is just a misunderstanding.  ","be mindful of your body language. make a joke. keep your voice down. use “i” statements. keep perspective. "
"Basically, you'll need about 8 to a dozen pears, depending on the size of the container you're using, velvet ribbon, pieces of greenery, such as boxwood stalks, and a container. The container should be something you're proud to place on the table, such as a stem bowl, large bowl, cake stand, etc.  The pears must have their original stalk intact; don't use those which are missing a stalk.;  , Aim to have the better looking pieces facing outward to view.  Wash the pears first and ensure that they're dry before proceeding. Washing them is important because people can take a pear and eat it as they wish if they know it has been cleaned. Then, cut equal lengths from the velvet ribbon and tie bows on the stalks of each pear.  Simply arrange them pyramid style, with the most at the base, building up to a single one at the top. Check that the pears are sitting firmly and that all stalks are clearly visible with their pretty bows.  Another alternative is to place the arrangement on a sideboard as a room decoration––ideal for parties, open home inspections and for creating a cheery ambiance.  ","assemble the items needed. arrange the greenery around the base of the bowl, plate or stand. prepare the pears. arrange the pears on the stand or in the bowl. place in the center of the table. "

You can make this easily using simply a box; or, follow the same concept as the box but use foamcore to make it instead, assembling the box walls together with tape.

","make a softbox for your larger studio using the foamcore. make a light table. make a light reflector with the foamcore. if you have lost a lens cap, make your own! "
"The belts should lie flat across your upper chest and your upper thigh areas. If your belt becomes twisted, fold it lengthwise so that it's flattened for about 12 inches (30 cm) below the buckle. Pull the buckle over the folded area and turn it the right way around.This might require some patience, but it's well worth your time to protect your safety.  If the strap feels like it's cutting into your neck, try moving your seat forward or backward. Newer cars allow you to correct this issue with a restraint system. If all else fails, purchase a padded seat belt cover. You can find these in most big box stores., If your belt is pulling you too tightly, part of it is probably stuck. Since each make and model is assembled differently, read your car user's manual for specific instructions. In many cases, pulling on the shoulder strap while the belt is unbuckled will do the trick. If this doesn't work and you're not trained in auto mechanics, take your car to your dealership if it's under warranty. If not, take it to a reputable mechanic.  Many of the fixes detailed online involve taking the seat belt apart. Don't attempt this unless you absolutely know what you're doing.  ","untwist the seat belt, if necessary. fix an uncomfortable shoulder strap. loosen a retractable seat belt. "
"You can raise your voice, but avoid yelling at your children. You will find that you are becoming more upset than they are. Instead, use a stern but level tone that indicates you are not pleased. This will demonstrate that you are in control.If you are upset, angry, or unable to keep calm, do not discipline your child yet. Find a quiet, safe room where you can become level-headed first. With very young children, however, you may need to discipline them immediately.  Effective discipline shows children that their actions have consequences. This will prepare them for the difficult choices they may have to make later in life. There are two types of consequence-based punishment. These are:  Logical Consequences: When your children break a rule, you create a consequence by punishing them.This is effective on young children under the age of five who might not yet realize the effect of their actions.For example, if your toddler throws a tantrum, put them in time-out.  Natural consequences: In non-dangerous situations, you let your children make a mistake and learn from the consequences that occur as a result.You can start doing this when your child is a toddler up through their teens. For example, if an older child does not do their homework, do not help them with it. Instead, let them get in trouble at school. After school, discuss with them the effect of their actions, and let them know that you expect better from them in the future., If your children consistently break the rules, you should take away something they enjoy for a brief period of time. Do this immediately after they break the rule.Only take away the privilege for a certain period of time. When you return it, make it clear that if they do not behave, it will be taken again.  For younger children, you might threaten to take away a bedtime story or morning cartoons.  Older children might respond better if you temporarily take away a video game console or TV time.  If you have a teenager, you might want to take away their phone, chargers, or internet access for non-school related matters.Never take away something the child needs. For example, do not take away meals.While you might sometimes put your child in time-outs during special events, make sure that your child can still socialize, even when they misbehave. Childhood is an important time to learn social skills.  Set a certain area in your house to be the official “time out” spot. Warn your children that they will be put there if they do not follow the rules. When they do get sent there, set a time limit. One minute per year of age is a good measure. Do not let them leave before the time is up., For teenagers, being grounded is the social equivalent of time out. You have taken away their ability to go out with friends. This can be effective to discipline your teenager if done correctly. Set a reasonable time period that they will be grounded for. They should not be grounded for more than a few days.If your teenager has a birthday party or a dance coming up, warn them that their bad behavior may prevent them from going.If they want to go, they will have to make it up to you, either by taking on more chores or writing an apologetic letter to you.  Do not strip away all of their privileges at once. You may find your teenager is acting out more because they have nothing left to lose.  ","use a calm, firm voice. show them the consequences of their actions. take away toys and privileges. put younger children in time out. ground teenagers. "

"When you're checking out, the cashier often asks for your e-mail. This is so the store can send you coupons and updates on sales. However, these e-mails often get lost in your regular e-mail. Create a separate e-mail address to give out at the register. Check this address when you're planning a shopping trip.  It's a simple change, but sometimes making a list can help you bargain shop. Try to make a list of the items you actually need before going on a shopping trip. Then, stick to that list strictly. You may end up overspending on impulse purchases without a list. Whether you're grocery shopping, clothes shopping, or shopping for anything else, write out what you need ahead of time., You're more likely to seek out bargains if you have to find a discount. If you set a strict budget for yourself, and make sticking to it a priority, you'll end up buying cheaper items. This can also help prevent impulse buys.  It's fairly easy to make a budget. To start, write down your total monthly income. From there, subtract necessary expenses like cost of living and any monthly bills. The amount that you have left is how much you can reasonably spend on extras throughout the month.  From here, break down how you spend money into categories. Jot down things like food, entertainment, clothes, and so on. You can then choose a reasonable budget for how much you should aim to spend on each category.  Stick to your budget, even if it's hard at first. If you budget $200 a month for food, do not go over that budget. While ordering takeout after a stressful work day might seem tempting, if it's not in your budget it avoid it., Many people don't realize they'll be more adept at bargain hunting if they shop in the right mindset. Shopping when you're stressed or tired could lead you to make quick purchasing decisions instead of looking for the best price. Shopping when you're hungry could lead you to stocking up on cheap convenience food over something substantial. Make sure you're in a good mood before going shopping. If you're feeling stressed, tired, or hungry, take some time to unwind and eat before heading out the door., Oftentimes, simply setting a timeframe can make a big difference in your purchasing decisions. If you give yourself an endless amount of time at the supermarket, you're more likely to wander through the aisles browsing. Browsing can lead to impulsive and regrettable purchasing decisions. Set a timeframe for yourself and stick to it. Give yourself, say, an hour in the grocery store to grab your items and head out.However, one caveat is that you shouldn't limit your time too much. If you don't give yourself enough time to shop, you may start to feel stressed out or otherwise pressured. Remember, a bad mood can also lead to impulse buys. Time how long you would normally spend at the grocery store when sticking to your list. This will help you gauge what a reasonable timeframe is. Give yourself about that much time to shop as a rule.  People tend to spend less money when they're paying in cash. You think less about how much money you're spending when you're paying with a card. Cash forces you to acknowledge how much you've spent. Withdraw money from your bank account before a shopping trip. Try to pay in cash as much as possible.Keep in mind paying with cash is not always possible. If you're going to be making a purchase well over $100, you may want to use your card. It can be dangerous to travel with that much cash on you.  Shopping with another person can be risky. You may talk one another into buying items you do not really need or want. With clothes shopping especially, a friend might love a particular blouse on you and convince you to buy it. You may regret this down the road if you felt lukewarm about the garment. If you want to bargain shop, it's best to head to the store alone.However, one exception is if you have a friend who's particularly good at finding discounts or using coupons. You may actually want to take a friend like this shopping a few times to get the hang of hunting for bargains.  ","have a separate e-mail for coupons. make a list. set a budget. shop when you're in a good mood. set a timeframe for shopping. pay with cash. shop alone. "
"Maintain high levels of polyphenols in your body and bloodstream throughout the day! Eat and drink the polyphenol-rich foods that are described below every few hours. Blood levels of polyphenols will peak soon after they are consumed, then decrease as they are metabolized or excreted from the body. Some polyphenols will not be absorbed into the bloodstream, but will merely pass through the digestive tract. These polyphenols are very important as well because they may help to prevent colon cancer and such diseases.;  , Refining of foods removes polyphenols, so eat fresh or freshly cooked fruits, vegetables, whole grains and legumes instead of refined foods and meat products. Polyphenols tend not to be destroyed by moderate cooking or heating, and cooked foods may offer a more bioavailable source of polyphenols. Eat fresh and cooked plant foods.  Rich colors such as reds and purples or black indicate that plant foods are excellent sources of polyphenols. Choose foods such as blueberries, pomegranates, red grapes, cranberries, and red or purple sweet potatoes. Blueberries as well as foods such as black rice, purple barley, black sorghum, and purple potatoes are sources of anthocyanins, as well as other polyphenols. The compound responsible for the color of turmeric, called curcumin, also happens to be a polyphenol.  Beverages are concentrated, easily absorbed sources of polyphenol antioxidants.  Choose fruit juices that do not have added sugar. Pure pomegranate, blueberry, red grape, and unfiltered apple juice or cider are excellent choices.  Tea and coffee are very rich sources certain types of polyphenols. Choose caffeinated tea and coffee, as the decaffeination process may remove polyphenols along with the caffeine.  Drink red wine and beer instead of other alcoholic beverages. Hard liquor is distilled so essentially does not contain polyphenols. Red wine is an associated with the 'French Paradox,'which essentially initiated the discovery that red wine and other plant foods may be very important to health and prevent chronic disease. Red wine is a very rich source of the famous polyphenol Resveratrol, which is present in high concentrations in the skins of wine grapes. For the highest concentrations of resveratrol, choose Pinot Noir wines from colder, damp climates such as New York and Oregon. Resveratrol is formed in large quantities by the grapes in such climates because the resveratrol is needed to protect the grapes from mold in such conditions. Beer is also a great source of polyphenols, and contains a great variety of polyphenols. This is because beer is made with barley as well as hops. Barley provides the majority of the polyphenols found in beer, but hops are an important source of a variety of polyphenols. For the highest concentrations of polyphenols, choose well-hopped bitter beers such as India Pale Ales or dark beers. Dark malt that is used to make dark beers provides melanoidin antioxidants that actually may help to keep the hop polyphenol antioxidants in the beer during the brewing process. Non-alcoholic red wine and beer are also available, and may be a good source of polyphenols as well.  Chocolate and cocoa are somewhat refined, but are one of the richest sources of polyphenols. Choose dark, bitter chocolate and unsweetened cocoa. The saturated fat in chocolate should not raise bad cholesterol when consumed in moderation.  Polyphenols tend to be astringent, bitter or harsh on the palate. Pure pomegranate juice is noticeably astringent. Yellow onions that make you cry are higher in polyphenols than sweet onions. Be sure to choose polyphenol-rich foods that have not been overly sweetened or diluted, as the sugar and other such ingredients can negate the healthy effects of the polyphenols. Unfiltered, astringent olive oils are also great sources of polyphenols.  Plants raised organically or in more natural conditions can be much higher in polyphenols. An Italian study which found that organic peaches and pears have higher levels of polyphenols than conventional counterparts suggests that the absence of pesticides encourages a stronger antioxidant defense system (i.e. more polyphenols).Plants actually produce polyphenols in order to protect themselves from diseases and pests, especially when grown in less than ideal conditions. And then you eat the plants and the polyphenols protect you!  , Many supermarkets actually list certain polyphenols in the produce section for many vegetables, although it is unlikely that the word “polyphenol” will be used. Look for words such as “phenol” and “anthocyanin”. Other healthy plant compounds that are not polyphenols will also be listed, such as the carotenoid lutein. Try writing down these words and then search for them online to determine exactly what they are.  Many current food products list polyphenols on their labels. Some polyphenols may be listed as substances such as flavonoids, flavonols, or anthocyanins. Current products such as antioxidant beverages and chocolate specifically list polyphenols and polyphenol flavonols. It is generally not legal for alcoholic beverages in the United States to list polyphenols on the label, although one Oregon winery has listed resveratrol on the label of their 2002 Pinot Noir.  Polyphenols are antioxidants so will essentially be neutralized or destroyed by unhealthy free radicals. It is good that free radicals can be neutralized by polyphenols, but the polyphenols will not be able to act in the body to the extent that is desirable. Therefore, avoid foods that are high in free radicals such as deep fried foods, meats, and refined foods. Be sure to avoid overly cooked or charred meats and chemically treated meats such as bacon. Deep fried foods are notorious sources of free radicals, as the deep frying oil is continuously oxidized as it is heated. The fried food is also cooked at very high temperatures, so more free radicals are formed.  Your body will use up antioxidant polyphenols faster if you are under stress.  ","eat and drink polyphenol-rich foods throughout the day. eat lots of unrefined fruits, vegetables, whole grains and legumes. choose richly hued fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. drink polyphenol-rich beverages. eat dark chocolate and cocoa powder. select bitter, astringent, or strongly flavored plant foods. shop for produce at the farmers' market or grow your own. look for polyphenols listed on grocery shelves when choosing produce. read food labels and choose foods with listed polyphenols. avoid foods that are sources of free radicals and destroy antioxidant polyphenols. relax.

"Free radicals in your stomach can break down your stomach lining, making your ulcer worse.Antioxidants are known as free radical scavengers — they destroy the free radicals that could cause you harm. Because of this, you should eat foods that contain antioxidants. These include:Red wine  Pomegranate juice  Grape juice  Buckwheat  Barley  Beans and lentils  Nuts (walnuts, peanuts, hazelnuts, almonds, etc.)  Chocolate  Berries (blueberries, cranberries, blackberries, raspberries, strawberries, etc.)  Certain spices (including clove, allspice, cinnamon)  Certain herbs (including peppermint, oregano, thyme, sage, rosemary)  Tomato products (sauces, sun-dried tomatoes);  , Flavonoids are found in many plants and are defined as organic compounds of biological pigments. Flavonoids also fight free radicals, meaning they are protectors of your stomach lining, just like antioxidants.Foods rich in flavonoids include:  Blueberries  Strawberries  Peaches  Apples  Oranges  Celery  Black beans  Black, green, and oolong teas  Beer  , While it is an uncommon drink, cabbage juice is very effective in curing stomach ulcers. Cabbage is naturally rich in bacteria that produce lactic acid; these bacteria are essential in fighting and destroying the bacteria that causes ulcers.You should drink 50 ml of cabbage juice twice a day when your stomach is empty.  Cabbage juice can be made at home using a juicer, or can be purchased from some markets and health stores.  Research has also shown that cranberry juice is powerful when it comes to preventing bad bacteria from fusing to the lining of your stomach.  You can drink cranberry juice, eat fresh cranberries, or take cranberry supplements (available from pharmacies and vitamin stores).  Research shows that powerful wound-healing agents are found in white sweet potatoes.Eating these may help heal your ulcer. You can find white sweet potatoes at many markets and prepare them in several ways, including steaming and baking.  Research and tradition demonstrate that honey is a powerful natural antibiotic. For this reason, it can help fight the H. pylori bacteria that cause ulcers.Try to consume a couple spoonfuls of honey each day to combat your ulcer.  Licorice extract is available from many markets, pharmacies, and health stores.  Talk to your doctor before starting a licorice regimen and discuss other medications you may be taking. Licorice supplements taken with with diuretics, corticosteroids, or other medicines that lower the body’s potassium levels could reduce potassium to dangerous levels.Take licorice supplements as instructed by your doctor.  Research indicates that eating bananas can help treat the symptoms of stomach ulcers by helping to protect the lining of the stomach.Though it will not heal an existing ulcer, eating bananas may help treat your symptoms.  Dried unripe plantains may also help, but ripe plantains do not seem to have a positive effect., When you would normally put a pat of butter in the frying pan to cook your eggs or vegetables in, you should instead use olive oil. These oils contain healthy fats that are processed more easily than the heavier fats found in animal products like butter.You can also try cooking with coconut oil, rice bran oil, sesame oil or safflower oil  , A bland diet concentrates on easily-digestible, low-fiber foods. These are gentle on your stomach and are less likely to irritate ulcers.You should talk with your doctor about whether or not a bland diet is a good treatment for your ulcer, and how long to follow it if it is. Foods you can eat on a bland diet include:  Low-fat dairy products (milk, yogurt, etc.)  Cooked, canned, or frozen vegetables without seasoning  Fruit and vegetable juices  Applesauce  Hot cereals  Lean, tender meats such as boiled chicken or baked fish, without seasonings  Creamy peanut butter  Tofu  , While alcoholic drinks like wine can have some health benefits, alcohol can irritate the lining of your stomach. When you have an ulcer caused by H. pylori, alcohol only makes the situation worse.,, Spicy foods might make ulcers more painful if you already have one, but they won’t cause one.It is best to avoid all spicy foods (hot peppers, hot sauces, etc.) if you have an existing ulcer or are predisposed to them.  These fats are hard to digest, which can irritate ulcers.  , If you are addicted to tobacco products, talk to your doctor about treatments that can help you quit so that your ulcer can heal.  These common pain relievers, fever reducers, and anti-inflammatory medications may cause ulcers in some people, especially if taken for extended periods of time or at high doses. If you are taking NSAIDs for an existing condition, talk to your doctor about other medications you can take instead (such as acetaminophen).  If you are suffering from one, avoiding or reducing stress factors can help you heal faster. Meditation and breathing exercises are easy, natural ways to relieve stress and treat ulcers.  ","eat antioxidant-rich foods. look for foods that contain lots of flavonoids. drink cabbage juice. consume cranberry products.cranberry is known to fight h. pylori. eat white sweet potatoes. use more honey. take licorice supplements.licorice root has anti-h. pylori properties, so it can help heal your ulcer. eat more bananas. switch from butter to oil. follow a bland diet. eliminate alcohol from your diet. don’t drink milk for relief.drinking milk can provide some temporary relief from pain caused by ulcers because it will coat the stomach; however, drinking milk will also encourage your stomach to produce more acid, worsening your symptoms in the long run. , avoid spicy foods. don’t eat fatty foods.deep fried foods, fast food meals, and other high-fat foods should be avoided. stay away from garlic.people who have ulcers, or who are prone to them, should avoid garlic because it can irritate existing ulcers and possibly cause new ones. , quit tobacco products.regular use of tobacco has been shown to slow or prevent the healing of ulcers. stop taking nsaids.non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) include aspirin, naproxen, and ibuprofen. avoid stress.it is still thought that stress can aggravate ulcers and worsen symptoms, even if it has now been shown that stress does not cause most ulcers.

"Silk flowers cannot be dyed using fabric dye, because the fabric cannot be boiled. Although you can attempt using food coloring, it will likely rinse off the fabric because it is not permanent. The most success has come from dying silk flowers with acrylic paint. Therefore, you will need a tube of acrylic paint in a color of your choice, a container of gel medium, and water.  Depending on the type of silk flower you use, you may need to prepare them a bit. If your flower has a stamen in the center, you’ll need to use painters tape to block it off in order to prevent it from being dyed. Anything else you don’t want colored should be blocked off with painters tape as well.  To make the dye for your silk flowers, mix 2 parts acrylic paint with 1 part gel medium, Use a stir stick or spoon to fully incorporate this, and then add a small amount of water to thin it down. The amount of water you add to the mixture is dependent on how bright you want the dye to be; the more water you add, the paler the final color. When you’re done, put the dye in a wide-brimmed bowl or container, and place newspapers around it to prevent leaks.  Place a single flower in the dye, and hold it so that it is completely covered in the color. Carefully lift it out of the dye using the stem or tweezers (if there is no stem), and place it onto the newspapers. Use a paper towel to pat the flower and remove the excess dye. Then, leave the flower to dry on the newspaper for 2-3 hours.  Work through all your flowers, dying them using the aforementioned methods. After they have dried for about 3 hours, remove any painters tape you might have applied.  ","gather your supplies. prepare your flowers. make your acrylic dye. dye your flowers. repeat the process.

Then use a marker to draw a half-tree shape on the outside of your paper stack. Finally, cut along the lines through both sheets of paper. You will now have two identical tree shapes.  You can make a large tree by using two full-size sheets of construction paper, or you can cut one piece of paper in half.  First, find and mark the vertical center of each tree by folding it in half vertically (fold the pointed tip of the tree down to the base of the tree,) then lightly crease or mark the center. Finally, cut a slit in one tree from the top down to the center mark, and cut a slit in the other tree from the bottom up to the center.  Slide the two pieces together along the slits so that the middles match. Then use a few small piece of clear tape at the top and bottom of the tree to hold it all together. Finally, fold the tree open so that it stands on its own.  The sky is the limit with this step; be as creative as you like. You can use paint or glitter glue to add sparkle, or even “flock” you tree. Cut ornaments out of colored paper using scissors or a hole punch, and glue them to the tree. Create a garland out of metallic thread or ribbon, and don’t forget a tiny star or angel on top.

"In a study on empathy in pigs, researchers looked at how pigs responded when their pen mates were placed in stressful or potentially harmful situations. When one group of pigs were in danger or experiencing a threat, the other group responded with stress signals like pushing their ears back and becoming more alert. This indicates that pigs have the ability to show emotional contagion, where they share the emotional response that another pig is having, which is a key part to having the capacity for empathy.While you may not want to conduct your own test on animals, you can observe if the animal reacts when another animal appears in danger or under stress. The animal may respond with stress related noises or actions, such as a more alert or rigid body movements, cries or howls, and moving towards the animal under stress.;  , In a study on empathy in elephants, a researcher observed an elephant mother who gave birth to a stillborn baby. The mother then guarded her dead calf for two days and tried several times to revive the dead calf’s body. When the researcher offered the elephant mother water, the elephant drank the water and then touched her chest as if in a sign of mourning.Though elephants have been one of the more studied animals in terms of empathy, an animal may display empathy by trying to protect an injured animal from a predator. The animal may also respond to a dead animal by displaying signs of mourning over their body or to others, such as the elephant mother touching her chest., Often, animals of the same species will protect each other and respond to the needs of their herd or pack. You may observe animals working together to build a habitat, such as a den, or you may observe animals working as a team to capture a prey or elude a predator. These group related activities can be a sign of empathy among the animals, as they must focus on how their fellow animals are thinking and feeling and respond to it in kind.

"For a commercial property, the value depends largely on how profitable it is. Profits can be increased by raising rents, or, by reducing expenses. Fortunately, it is possible to reduce expenses without impacting the operations of the property significantly.  Consider adding energy efficient light bulbs throughout the property. This will cost money upfront, but will save significantly over time.  Consider passing some expenses, like gas utilities for example, on to tenants. If your gas company can individually meter units, consider asking them to do so. This will enable you to monitor and charge gas expenses to individual tenants.  Investing in modern heating and air conditioning systems can also go a long way to reducing costs over the long-term.  Enter into a long-term contract with suppliers. This may decrease the costs of your regular supplies purchases.  Consistent maintenance can also reduce your expenses by reducing the chance of expensive accidents.  Property valuations are often outdated or inaccurate, and sometimes a simple reassessment can significantly lower your tax obligation, thus improving your bottom line..  Your property value is often only assessed by local governments, and therefore your property value may reflect a time period where property values were higher. In addition, assessors often make errors, and your assessor very well may have over-estimated how valuable your property is.  If you feel your property is overvalued, you can contact your local tax assessor and ask for a revaluation. If you are unhappy with the new figure, you can always appeal their opinion.  To do so, visit your tax assessor's office and request forms to appeal. You can also request information on the values of other properties as well. If you notice that similar properties are carrying lower valuations, the strength of your case increases greatly.  Alternatively, contact an attorney or real estate agent who specializes in appealing property assessments.  The building should be up-to-date, comparable to surrounding buildings in quality and representative of the area's aesthetic style. Make sure that you’re using current, energy-efficient heating and air-conditioning, water heaters, and lights to save on regular energy costs.Upgrading the roofing on your property can be one way to modernize its appearance, cut costs, and prevent damage to your property. For this reason, a new roof can offer an excellent return on investment.  Go green. When updating your property, keep eco-friendliness in mind. This will not only keep your property relevant in today's earth-conscious consumer market, but it will also lower overhead costs. Green options include solar panels, energy-efficient appliances and energy conserving windows. There may even be tax incentives.When modernizing, ensure every change creates more value than it costs. For example, if you are spending $2,000 on new air conditioning, for example, this new air conditioning should lead to $2,000 in saved costs over time, or should enable you to attract, maintain, or increase rents on tenants.  ","decrease expenses. request that the tax assessor re-evaluate your property value. modernize your property. "
"Mindfulness is the practice of bringing your attention to the present moment, helping you notice your physical and emotional sensations. This is particularly helpful in order to recognize your own and others’ feelings.To be effective, you’ll want to start your practice when you are not overwhelmed by strong emotions. Begin by setting aside just 5 minutes to sit and breathe. Focus completely on your breath. When your attention wanders, don’t pass judgment. Simply re-focus on your breath.  You can enhance your emotional well-being by incorporating mindfulness into your daily life. For example, stopping at a red light, hearing a telephone ring, or even purposely setting an hourly bell or alarm, can help you remember to pause and engage in mindfulness for a few minutes., Mindfulness helps you slow down to become more in tuned with your emotional experience. A body scan meditation helps you dig deeper, to recognize the way you experience these feelings in your physical body.To do a body scan, you’ll start from either the top of your head or the bottom of your feet. Work your way up through each body part, assessing what each part feels like. Is it relaxed, tense, numb, etc.? If you notice tension or discomfort, imagine breathing in relaxation and letting the discomfort melt away. Engage in deep breathing throughout the exercise.  You need time to decompress from your own emotional experience and release any emotional contagion that you absorb from the world around you. A great way to perform self-care is by carving out time each day to do something you enjoy.During this time, you might listen to music, read a book, go for a run, take a bath, or cook yourself a nourishing meal.  You may think of yoga as a form of physical exercise, but this ages-old practice can also help with emotional self-regulation. Yoga promotes mind-body awareness and can help you relieve conditions such as anxiety and depression.Sign up for a yoga class in your area. Or, view yoga videos on YouTube to start your practice.  If you are constantly plugged into the news, social media, and television shows, it can be hard to tell which emotions are yours and which have been absorbed from various media sources. Regular unplugging can offer a release from this ambush of emotional energy.Dedicate 30 minutes or an hour each day to unplugging. Go outdoors, take a nap, or simply sit and enjoy the silence.  If you are having problems balancing your own feelings with those of others, journaling may help. See it as an outlet for you to pour out any thoughts and emotions that are inside of you. As you develop your practice, you may start to see trends in your entries that explain why you are feeling or behaving a certain way.  ","practice mindfulness. learn to identify and label your emotions with a body scan. schedule daily me-time. begin a yoga practice. unplug often to prevent emotional overload. journal. "

Either have a high school diploma or an equivalent GED certificate.  Have a valid driver’s license.  Have no felony convictions in the state of California or any other U.S. state.  Have no misdemeanor convictions, which will prevent you from carrying a firearm.;  , Before you begin to apply, ensure that being a police officer is a career for you. If you are a youth, consider joining Youth Police Explorers in your area. If you are not a youth, contact your local police department. Tell them that you are interested in becoming a police officer, and ask if you can participate in ride-alongs. Or, volunteer at your local department through a cadet program.You can also ask police officers about their career experiences. Ask an officer, 'What are the perks of being a police officer?' 'What are the cons?' 'What type of service calls come in regularly?' 'What's the typical day, graveyard, and swing shift like?' and, 'What is the department's diversity?'  Attend local community meetings conducted by police or LE personnel.  Although additional education, like a college degree or an associate’s degree, is not required, it will enhance your application. Consider getting an associate’s degree in criminal justice if you do not have a college degree.  An assoicate’s degree in criminal justice helps you prepare to become a police officer. It offers courses in legal issues, human behavior, computer systems, and other subjects. These degrees are also available online.If you are in the midst of getting your BA or BS, look into criminology and law enforcement classes and majors. Also, an accounting degree is great for people who are interested in white collar crime. And, a computer science degree is great for people who are interested in computer forensics and cyber crime., All departments require that you pass a physical agility test.

"The kidneys have a huge reserve capacity and it isn't until at least 75% of total kidney function is lost that the cat shows clinical signs of a problem.  Thus, by the time a diagnosis can be reached the cat is coping on a maximum of 25% of the renal capacity when healthy. (This sounds alarming, but remember when people donate a kidney, they automatically lose 50% of their renal capacity and yet do not become ill).  Unfortunately, as total kidney function declines, the nephrons (the individual filtration units contained in the kidneys) which are still working are asked to work harder and so their demise is hastened. It is therefore important to identify renal disease in the cat are early as possible because early treatment extends the life of the remaining nephrons.  However, early detection is problematic because blood screening is relatively insensitive up to the point where 75% damage has occurred. Many vet clinics offer routine yearly, or six-monthly screening programs for senior (over the age of 7 years) cats.;  , Kidney failure is usually accompanied by a range of symptoms. The symptoms occur as the body adapts in order to minimize the effects of kidney disease.  As an owner you may notice little changes in your cat early on, such as the need to fill the water bowl more often, or empty the litter tray more regularly. These are signs that the cat is drinking more, a sign which should never be ignored.  However, many of the signs associated with renal disease overlap with other conditions, such as diabetes mellitus, liver disease, pancreatitis, or infections. This means that a definitive diagnosis cannot be made on symptoms alone, but they are a strong hint that further steps need to be taken to get to the bottom of the problem.  You may notice if your cat develops unusual habits such as drinking from the toilet or if the water bowl constantly needs topping up. Increased thirst happens as a result of the kidney losing its ability to recycle water from the blood stream.  The body loses water through the urine, which is more dilute, and so this water needs to be replaced, causing increased thirst in the cat.  Because the cat is drinking more and is not able to concentrate her urine as well, the volume of urine produced is larger. This means the bladder fills more often and the cat needs to urinate more often to stay comfortable.  Cardinal signs are needing to clean the litter tray more often, or a break down in house training habits.  Even though the cat drinks more, there is often an imbalance between water loss and water taken in, which results in the gradual development of dehydration.  Veterinarians assess this during a physical examination by looking at how quickly the scruff springs back to its normal position. To do this, gently grasp a piece of scruff over the shoulder blades, between the finger and thumb of one hand. Lift the scruff 3–4 inches (7.6–10.2 cm) away from the backbone and release it.  In a well-hydrated animal the scruff springs straight back into the normal position. In a dehydrated animal the skin loses elasticity which means it returns slowly to the resting position. If the skin takes over a second to slip back down then the cat is probably dehydrated.  As part of the kidneys impaired ability to filter, large molecules such as protein tend to leak through the kidneys and be lost in the urine. Protein loss represents an important waste of calories.  Another reason for weight loss is that the buildup of natural toxins often makes the cat feel nauseous, which reduces her appetite.  Cats get bad breath for many reasons, including rotten teeth, gum infections, diabetes mellitus, diet, and kidney failure. In kidney disease it is the toxins that cause the bad breath and this is described as having a typical ammonia-like smell.  This smell is not always easy to detect and some people's noses seem better tuned to pick up ammonia smells than others.  The same toxins that cause bad breath also damage tissues and cause ulceration in the mouth and stomach lining. Of these, you can see the ulcers in the mouth. They tend to form along the margins of the tongue, or where the teeth meet the gum.  Again, ulcers do form for other reasons such as viral infections or if the cat has licked a caustic substance, but it remains a sign that needs to be taken note of.  Ultimately, when protein loss exceeds intake from the diet, the cat's muscle starts to break up to provide her with the necessary protein requirements.  Cats with kidney failure are typically thin, with dull coats and wasted muscles.  Gastric ulcers caused by a buildup of toxins make the cat nauseous. This results in vomiting and a reluctance to eat.  Scar tissue causes the kidneys to shrink and failing kidneys typically feel smaller than usual. Especially in thin cats, the kidneys are easy to feel in their location sitting beneath the lumbar vertebra.  Gauging their relative size is a subjective measurement and a skill that veterinarians acquire over the years. Don't try to feel your cat's kidneys at home.  A normal kidney is usually equivalent in length to that of three lumbar vertebrae, and shrunken kidneys measure less than two lumbar vertebrae in length.  Scar tissue forms fairly uniformly throughout the kidney and so the surface of the kidney feels smooth and both feel equally shrunken. However, cancerous kidneys often feel knobbly with a rough, bumpy surface.  The latter is an important indication for kidney biopsy because some renal cancers are amenable to chemotherapy, whereas old age kidney deterioration is not.  The kidney breaks down several hormones that control blood pressure. When the kidney is not working properly the levels of these hormones rise which creates an increased risk of high blood pressure o hypertension.  On physical examination the veterinarian may see telltale signs of hemorrhage on the retina, or even spot detached retinas, which are a common consequence of hypertension.  Once again, high pressure is not diagnostic of kidney failure, but a strong clue that needs to be followed up on.  Urine analysis is an extremely valuable tool for assessing renal health, especially in the early stages of kidney disease. A simple dipstick test can quickly rule out conditions which cause increased thirst such as diabetes, if no glucose is present.  A dipstick test also gives a rough indication of the protein content of the urine. A high protein level can result from a urine infection (in which case blood is commonly present in the urine) or kidney disease.  If blood is present the clinician will suggest either treating preemptively with antibiotics, or sending the urine for culture. Only once the blood has cleared can a decision be reached that the protein is because of leakage from the kidney.  Specific gravity is a measure of how dilute or how concentrated the urine is. Cats are very efficient at concentrating their urine, in order to preserve water.  Specific gravity is measured relative to water (which is SG 1.000). A healthy urine SG is between 1.035 – 1.060. Urine below SG 1.035 is considered abnormally dilute. Urine SG below 1.025 is significantly dilute.  Dilute urine should contain very little protein, thus a result of a low SG and high protein level is an indicator that the kidneys are not concentrating urine and are leaking protein. This is an important pointer towards kidney disease, which can be detected before changes are evident in the blood test.  This test measures the ratio of protein in urine to another naturally occurring metabolite called creatinine. The normal value in the cat is below 0.4. Ratios above 1.0 indicate significant protein loss which needs investigating.  Blood tests play an important role in identifying cats that have lost over 75% of their functional kidney capacity. Most useful for diagnosing kidney failure are three indicators: blood urea, creatinine, and phosphate levels.  Blood Urea: Normal blood urea levels in the cat are less than 32mg/ml and levels above 35mg/ml are considered to be high. Whilst raised urea in the blood is an indicator of kidney failure, it can be high for other reasons. Therefore raised urea levels alone are not sufficient to diagnose renal failure.  Blood Creatinine: The normal level in cats is below 130 umol/l. Any reading above 130 umol/l is likely to indicate renal disease. Creatinine is a waste product of protein breakdown and is only excreted by the kidneys.  Phosphate levels: The kidney finds it difficult to excrete phosphate and when kidney function fails the levels of phosphate in the blood stream rise. Normal levels are below 2.6mmol/l. Unfortunately, high blood phosphate levels cause further kidney damage and so a vicious circle of poor kidney function leading to phosphate retention, which then causes further damage.  High levels of urea, creatinine and phosphate is a strong indication of kidney disease. However, raised results do not necessary tell the clinician whether the problem lies within the kidney (i.e. true kidney failure) or if the kidney is under strain because of another condition such as dehydration.  To investigate whether the problem is pre-renal (caused by dehydration) or renal, the clinician often suggests rehydrating the cat by putting her on an intravenous drip for 2-3 days, and then repeating the blood tests at the end of this time.  If in the fully rehydrated cat the results are now normal, this indicates the kidney is probably functioning normally but was under severe stress. If however the results remain raised in the hydrated cat, kidney failure is likely.  Kidney biopsy plays a limited role in the diagnosis of kidney failure. The main indication for kidney biopsy is when renal cancer is suspected, in which case a definitive diagnosis as to the type of cancer can indicate whether chemotherapy would be beneficial or not.  The majority of renal cancers present with either large kidneys, or kidneys with knobbly surfaces – which contrasts sharply with the small, smooth feel of kidneys with renal failure.  With the exception of kidney cancer, most causes of renal failure are treated in the same way. Putting the cat through the extra stress of an anesthetic and a surgical procedure in order to reach a precise diagnosis which is largely of academic interest is therefore not warranted.  ","understand the difficulties surrounding early detection. watch your cat carefully for symptoms. look for signs of increased thirst. take note of whether the cat is urinating more often. watch the cat for signs of dehydration. identify any weight loss . sniff your cat's breath. check for oral ulcers. identify any muscle wastage. watch for vomiting and a poor appetite. feel the cat's kidney size. look for kidney symmetry and shape. measure the cat's blood pressure. do a dipstick urine analysis. try a specific gravity urine test. test the urine protein creatinine ratio (upc). take a sample of the cat's blood for blood testing. do a test to distinguish between kidney disease and dehydration. perform a kidney biopsy only if renal cancer is suspected.

"When starting the game, you will be able to choose a few upgrades for your virus. What you choose here will have a huge impact on how the game plays out, so choose wisely. There are a few suggested upgrades that you should pick to make this game easier:  DNA Gene - ATP Boost. This will give you extra DNA points at the beginning, which is essential for slowing down the cure.  Travel Gene - Aquacyte. Basically required to infect difficult islands like Greenland, Iceland, and New Zealand.  Evolution Gene - Sympto-Stasis. This will keep symptom costs low.  Mutation Gene - Genetic Mimic. This slows the cure progression, which is important because the search for the cure starts immediately.  Environment Gene - Extremophile. This boosts the infection rate in every environmental condition.;  , Before choosing a starting country, use your ATP Boost bonus to purchase a few starting upgrades. These will make your life much easier later on in the game, and will help mitigate the cure.  Code fragment interception - This will help slow down the cure.  Coughing  Cysts  Abscesses  Insomnia  Paranoia  , Your starting country is very important, as this will determine how quickly the virus starts spreading. Most guides recommend starting in India due to the large population and proximity to China, though others suggest Saudi Arabia.  As soon as you choose a country, work will begin on the cure.  At the start of the game, you should prioritize certain upgrades to give you a much better chance later on. As you start collecting DNA, evolve the following upgrades, in order as soon as you can afford them:Code segment interception  Nausea  Vomiting  Drug Resistance 1  Genetic Hardening 1 and 2  , If you receive pop-ups informing you that planes or ships have been sterilized, you should prioritize the corresponding transmission methods:  If airplanes are sterilized, evolve Air 1 immediately.  If ships are sterilized, evolve Water 1 immediately.  Your next few upgrades are aimed at slowing down the progression of the cure. These symptoms make the cure more difficult, and should be evolved as soon as possible:  Hyper-sensitivity  Paralysis  Coma  Seizures  Insanity  , The following upgrades make your virus harder to kill and more likely to spread. Evolve these quickly to increase the rate which your virus infects new countries and decrease the cure's research rate:Radical elements stabilized  Water 2  Air 2  Extreme bioaerosol  Drug Resistance 2  Cold Resistance 1 and 2  , Now that your virus is spreading, it's time to evolve some more symptoms. These will increase the infection rate, leading to an even quicker global infection:  Pneumonia  Sneezing  Rash  Sweating  Anemia  Hemophilia  Skin Lesions  Diarrhea  , There are a couple more upgrades that you should focus on to decrease the cure progress. These are not available until late in the game:  Encryption Breached  Drug Immunity  , Once every country in the world is infected, this ability can increase the infectivity of your virus. The downside is that after a short time, the infectivity will decrease to lower than its original value, so only use this after all countries are infected.  Occasionally, your virus will randomly mutate. It's highly recommended that you devolve these symptoms as they appear, as they can start killing people before the infection spreads to everyone.  Towards the end of the game, you will be racing against the cure. The Genetic Reshuffle ability will slow down the cure's progress, and is a good investment when you don't have much else to evolve. There are three levels, each of which will set the cure back.  When every person in the world is infected, you will receive a pop-up message. At this point, you're safe to evolve every lethal symptom, as you don't have to worry about infecting new people. At this point, the faster you can kill everyone off, the better.  ","choose your genes. buy some initial upgrades. choose a starting country. evolve essential upgrades. deal with sterilization. slow down the cure. increase the infection rate. evolve more symptoms. harden your virus. use replication factory overload. devolve random symptoms. shuffle your genes. evolve every symptom once everyone is infected.

"What will it help you achieve? Mentally reframe the unpleasant task as a necessary stepping stone to a better future. By focusing on the benefits you’ll get from completing the task, you might find that it’s easier to motivate yourself.For instance, maybe you don’t feel like working on an essay due for your college English course. Reframing the task could help you acknowledge that doing it will get you one step closer to finishing the course. Plus, practicing your writing skills will be beneficial in your aspirations to be a journalist.;  , Intrinsic motivation – the way an accomplishment makes you feel – can often be a more powerful motivator than external rewards or praise. Imagine how relieved, satisfied, or proud you’ll feel after completing the task. Visualization can give you the burst of energy you need to conquer the job.Intrinsic motivation comes from feelings of autonomy, mastery, and purpose. Look for ways your task is linked to these three factors. Can you complete the task on your own terms? Will it help you master a skill? Will it help you make purposeful progress towards an end goal you care about?  Harnessing the power of intrinsic motivation is an especially powerful way to get creative work done.  Repeating a mantra to yourself can be an effective way to stay in a positive state of mind. When you tell yourself something over and over, eventually you start to believe it, so a good mantra can help you get in the habit of thinking positively. Start your day off right by repeating your mantra to yourself as soon as you wake up.If you need ideas for a mantra, try one of the following:  “I’ve finished tough projects before, and I can do it again.”  “I’m not afraid to make mistakes. Making mistakes is part of making progress.”  “I value my time, so I make getting things done a priority.”  , Sometimes when you feel reluctant to do a task, it’s a sign that your time would be better spent on something else. Is this task really necessary to your project? Could somebody else do it, or could you find a more efficient way to get it done? Dropping work you don’t like from your to-do list can give you more time to accomplish other things.For example, maybe you loathe having to do the laundry, but your partner actually enjoys it. You can request to swap chores with them and complete an undesirable chore that this person has to do. That way, both of you get your chores done, but you don't have to do one that you particularly hate doing.  Taking a moment to count your blessing may help to motivate you to do something unpleasant. Try thinking about the task at hand as something that shows how you are blessed and write down or say what make you feel grateful about the task.For example, if you are dreading cleaning your room, you might say to yourself, “I am grateful that I have a room to clean. Many people are not as lucky.”  Or, if you are dreading writing a big paper for a college English class, then you might write out something like, “I am grateful that I have the chance to attend college. There are millions of people around the world who would love to be able to do this.”  ","find the “why.” why is this task important?, visualize how you’ll feel when it’s done. use motivational mantras. decide if you can delegate the task – or skip it entirely. identify reasons to be grateful as motivation.

Each team has one captain, three sidekicks and a goalkeeper (who is controlled by the computer, except during opposing mega strikes and when the goalkeeper has the ball).  Balanced: These characters are average in all aspects of the game which include shooting, passing, defense, and movement (speed). Balanced captains: Mario, Luigi, Yoshi. Balanced sidekicks: Shy Guy, Koopa Troopa.  Power: Players with excellent shooting and defensive skills, but lack in terms of speed and passing. Power captains: Bowser, DK, Petey. Power sidekicks: Birdo, Monty Mole.  Offensive: Offensive characters are great shooters and passers, but are slow and lacking on defense. Offensive Captains: Wario, Bowser Jr. Offensive Sidekicks: Hammer Bro.  Defensive: Players who are quick and play great defense, but are poor on offense and can't do much when the have the ball. Defensive Captains: Waluigi, Daisy. Defensive Sidekicks: Dry Bones.  Playmakers: Players who can pass well and are quick. They are good for setting up goals but don't shoot or play defense well. Playmaker Captains: Peach, Diddy Kong. Playmaker Sidekicks: Boo, Toad.  It's a tournament that's all about the road to the top...the ultimate prize of the game being the Striker Cup Trophy. You start out on the relatively easy Fire Cup, being one of four teams. Play each team twice, and the top two teams compete in an elimination game. The winner plays the Fire Cup Champion in a 3-game series. The champion is Bowser Jr, and if you win you unlock him as a playable character. You can then move forward to the Crystal Cup. The difficulty level is increased and there are now six teams. Play each team twice, top four teams advance. A two-round playoff system determines who plays the Champion (Diddy Kong) in a 3 game series. If you win, you unlock Diddy Kong an move on to the Striker Cup. The Striker Cup is tough and there are ten teams fighting for the trophy. Play each once, the best eight advance to playoffs. The winner in the playoffs faces the games final boss, Petey, in a series for the Cup. If you win, you have beaten the game and unlock Petey.  It is possible to score up to six points from a megastrike. To do one, when you are open, charge the ball as much as you can. Then, a meter will appear with different colored sections. A marker will begin to move up the meter. To stop the meter, press B. The farther up the meter goes, the more shots will be fired. The marker then comes back, and most of the meter is gray, with a small orange spot in the middle and green sections just outside the orange. If you get the meter to stop (by pressing B) in the gray, the shots will be fired slowly, giving the goalie a better chance of blocking them. Landing in the green results in a medium speed mega strike, and orange is very fast. Be careful when trying to select a high number of shots, the longer the meter goes, the more time your opponent has to stop you by stealing the ball. If you go too far, the meter will give you a default minimum three shots.  If the mega striker is successful in completing the move, you then act as the goalie to block the incoming balls. You take control of the goalie's hands with the Wii remote's motion detector function allowing you to point the remote at the screen and block each shot as it comes through. Remember to act fast and once your goalie's hands are over the ball, press A to destroy the ball.  Press B to charge the ball. The more charged the ball is the faster it moves between players and the more likely you are to score. You can tell how charged the ball is by its color. An uncharged ball is purple and a fully charged one is white, representing the best scoring opportunity. Besides just pressing B, you can also charge the ball by passing it to teammates and chipping it ahead with Z.  Mario Strikers Charged is playable online. Playing matches against real players can be very fun and challenging, as most online players are very experienced and many have found ways to take advantage of glitches in the game. Be informed that there are many cheaters online. The game keeps track of your wins and losses, and ranks players according to points. You are awarded ten points for a victory, and one point for defeat. You also get a point bonus of the number of goals you scored.

"One of the most obvious and distinguishing features of Welsh Black cattle is the color of their coats. Most Welsh Black cattle are all black, but there is an increasing variance in coloration that is now common, even among pure-bred Welsh Black herds.There is a certain degree of deviation in the shade of black that most Welsh Black cattle exhibit. Some are a rusty shade of black, while others are jet black.  Some Welsh Black cattle have a recessive red gene. They are still acknowledged as being Welsh Black, but those that show red do not have any genes for black coloration.Many Welsh Black cattle have a subtle white underline. These cattle are still considered Welsh Black, so long as the white is confined to the underside below the navel.;  , The coat on a Welsh Black will look very distinct, especially during colder months. It should appear appear thick, long, and shaggy. In fact, some breeders describe the Welsh Black winter coat as 'mossy' due to its scraggly appearance.The winter coat of Welsh black cattle developed as an adaptation to the harsh environments that they have historically inhabited.Many Welsh Blacks that reside in warmer regions have lost this distinguishing feature, and predominately appear as short-haired varieties.  In summer, Welsh Black cattle lose their thick, mossy coats. Some Welsh Black cattle who live in warmer climates may never have shaggy coats. A short-haired Welsh Black, whether in summer or in hotter environments, has a smooth and sleek coat. It may be almost glossy in appearance., Welsh Black cattle are considered a medium-sized breed.Mature cows weigh an average of about 1,100 pounds (about 500 kg). However, they can get much larger. It's not abnormal for mature Welsh Black cows to weigh anywhere from 1,300 to 1,750 pounds (600 to 800 kg), while bulls typically weigh 2,000 to 2,500 pounds (950 to 1,150 kg).They are not a very muscular breed, which is typical of Continental cattle breeds., The majority of Welsh Black cattle have horns.However, some Welsh Black cattle are naturally polled, meaning they are born without horns. This has been an increasing trait among both black and red Welsh Black cattle.The horns should be moderately long, with the tips fine and pointed.  Horns should start straight from the head and extend outward. There is no official direction in which horns should turn, though upward-turned horns are often preferred by breeders., The hooves of Welsh Black cattle are generally uniform. They tend to be tough and hard, and they're usually all black.Red Welsh Black cattle may have slightly lighter-colored hooves. Regardless of coloration, the hooves of Welsh Black cattle are not very prone to injury and are built for rugged terrain.  Welsh black cattle tend to grow much faster than other British breeds of cattle. Not only does their rate of growth exceed that of most other breeds, they also tend to have the highest average weight at any given age among their British counterparts. Because of this, Welsh black cattle could potentially be identified with a trained eye by their size and growth over time., Welsh black cattle are generally able to forage through fields, eating grass and other naturally-occurring plants. They do not typically require the costly feeds that many other breeds of cattle rely on, due in part to their hardiness and the landscape in which they've evolved over time., Welsh black cattle are native to Wales, of course. But breeders have managed to raise and transport them around the world, and they've successfully held populations in the rest of the U.K., as well as Canada, the United States, New Zealand, Australia, Spain, Germany, Saudi Arabia, Uganda, and Jamaica.Breeders who specialize in Welsh black cattle should offer a pedigree certificate upon sale of the cattle.You can purchase Welsh black cattle semen from specialty breeders, especially in the U.K.In the U.S., many breeders select for polled (hornless) cattle.However, horned Welsh black cattle are still bred in North America.

"The first step to waking up well in the morning is getting to bed the night before. Experts say adults should aim for between six to eight hours nightly, so organize your evening activities around getting a full night sleep. Additionally, experts also recommend finishing the use of electronic devices at least an hour before bedtime to give your brain time to shut down and prepare for sleep., Other than making it difficult to attain sleep, research indicates that when we sleep or dream in mild to moderate light, we rest less and wake up feeling more depressed than we ordinarily would. This includes sleeping in light generated by TVs, computers, nightlights and streetlights, which have all have been shown to negatively impact mood of sleepers.Try a sleeping mask or blackout curtains to block out light while you sleep.  Exposure to light interferes with our body's production of melatonin, which is a hormone that helps control your sleep and wake cycle.Dimming your lighting as you're preparing for bed and making your room as dark as possible can help keep your melatonin production on track., Meditation, deep breathing, or progressive muscle relaxation are ways to help calm anxiety, tension, or troublesome thoughts that might keep you awake. Try incorporating one or more of these practices into your nighttime routine.  Want to enjoy peaceful dreams and wake up in a good mood? Researchers have discovered that sleeping on your right side increases the chance that you will have positive dreams and also decreases the likelihood of mood dysfunction throughout the day. Having trouble keeping your sleep posture on the right side? Consider purchasing a body pillow. Having it on your left side will shape your sleep posture and prevent you from rolling to the left., Do you live near a busy intersection with lots of noise? Does your bedroom window face the sunrise or street lights? Purchasing light-blocking curtains and getting a white-noise device are only a few of the ways you can create a better environment for deep sleep.Install a ceiling fan. These can create white noise and also circulate air in a stuffy room.  Decorate with soothing colors. Repaint if necessary.  Use ambient lighting, as opposed to overhead lighting, when possible. Lamps are a good source for this, but recessed lighting inside wall molding is also an option. Dimmer switches can also create the right light level.  Choose the right alarm clock. To ensure waking without shock or grogginess, consider an alarm specially designed to wake you gradually.  Install an air purifier. For allergy sufferers, this is an essential and will result in vastly improved sleep quality.  Consider a foam mattress. Especially if you sleep with another person, foam mattresses are great at isolating movement so it doesn't wake the other person.  Research has shown that using your bed for activities like reading or watching movies can prevent sleep and create an association with stimulation rather than rest., If you find yourself having difficulty sleeping due to worries about your day, consider keeping a journal. Earlier in the day, ask yourself 'What keeps me awake at night?' and write down the things that are on your mind.Keep a notepad by your bed to record intrusive thoughts that wake you up during the night.  Take stock of accomplishments. One way of helping gain closure and foster reassurance is to write down what you've accomplished during the day.  Create a to-do list for the next day. Instead of lying awake, trying to remember what needs to happen tomorrow, create a list before going to bed. This helps you get closure on the current day while dialing back on the pressure to remember everything at once.  Try preparing for the next day before you go to bed. Lay out your clothes, pack a lunch, and assemble everything you'll need for work or school the next morning. This can help ease stress in the morning, and you'll feel better getting into bed know it's already been done.  When your body wakes up suddenly and goes back to sleep, only to wake up again a few minutes later, it creates a kind of dissonance called 'sleep inertia,' which makes you feel lazy, groggy, and can persist for up to two hours after waking.Select an alarm tone that will ensure that you wake up less grumpy.  To ensure that you aren't tempted to snag a few more minutes of sleep after the alarm goes off, put your alarm on a shelf or table across the room from your bed, forcing you to get up in order to turn it off.  Studies have shown that morning light between the hours of six and ten am triggers melatonin release in our brain and has an antidepressant effect, more so than later day or evening light. To ensure you get your daily dose, take a half hour to sit outside in the morning., Not only are flowers pretty to look at throughout the day, but Harvard psychologist Nancy Etcoff has discovered that women who wake up to the sight of flowers reported substantially improved mood, less anxiety, and more energy throughout the day. A nightstand arrangement of fresh or artificial flowers will brighten up your bedroom and, more importantly, serve as something positive and refreshing to wake up to., The thermogenic hypothesis argues that raising core body temperature relaxes muscles, which relieves tension, promoting an increased sense of well-being. Showering in warm water also increases circulation. Psychologists also argue that finishing your shower with a cool, five-minute rinse can duplicate some of the positive antidepressant effects of electroshock therapy, increasing brain function and the release of serotonin., Adding a few poses to your morning routine can help you feel energized and increase your ability to deal with stress throughout the day., While getting a few extra minutes of sleep is tempting, the rush required to make up for it can increase stress, lead to muscle tension, and cause us to be more forgetful than we ordinarily would. All these things have a negative impact on mood and create a negative association related to morning activities. So be sure to wake up early and tackle your morning in a well-paced, thoughtful way.  Everyone has a meaningful impact. What is yours?  Think deeply about your day—conversations with friends, favors you've done, actions taken. Think about the outcome of these actions. Do they have positive effects? If not, how could they? Change your behavior when needed so as to confidently bring a positive influence to the lives of others.  Are you good at a certain hobby or task? Do you have a good sense of humor and make other people laugh? Are you a fantastic problem-solver? Take the time to remind yourself of what you are good at and why that makes you a worthy person., Studies have shown that thinking on a 'big-picture' level about your job and its meaning leads to greater overall job satisfaction and increased ability to take pleasure from the work you do., It could be something as simple as a phone call with a loved one or lunch with your coworkers. Finding daily milestones of gratification is an important way to improve overall life satisfaction and put less enjoyable tasks in perspective.  PMA is life-coach shorthand for 'positive mental attitude,' and it is an essential part of creating personal happiness. Having a PMA means being able to believe in good times to come despite challenges in the present. It also means remaining confident that you will surmount challenges as they present themselves. Research has shown that this is not only a means of facilitating good mental and emotional health, but a PMA can actually have a positive influence on physical health as well. Below are seven steps to develop your PMA:Focus on the present. The past can remind us of episodes of fear or regret.  Use positive language. Don't gossip or put other people down. Use praise whenever possible for others and yourself.  Don't expect perfection. When we make the perfect the enemy of the good, we are never satisfied. Accept when things are not ideal and make them work anyway.  Interact with positive people. Find friends who share your desire for positivity. Support each other.  Do good deeds when and where you can. Something as small as paying for a stranger's coffee can make an impact.  Be a learner. Don't assume you know everything. Always keep an open mind and welcome new experiences and ideas.  Be thankful. Take stock of the things in your life that matter and bring you joy. Remind yourself of your good fortune.  It is understandably difficult to tackle life's challenges when we feel that we are unworthy and lack the ability to succeed. Therefore, the first step to happiness is learning to love yourself and being able to have a positive perception of your unique qualities.Stick to the '1:1 Ratio:' Self-criticism is an important part of self-improvement. That being said, it's easy to tear down yourself esteem if you get too focused on the negative. To combat this tendency, for every negative thought you have about yourself, try to balance it with a positive observation.  Give yourself the ability to succeed at something. Everyone looks for tasks that will validate their self-worth, and it is important to provide opportunities for regular success. For example, if you are having a hard week at work, find a hobby or project at home that will let you derive satisfaction from your skills and abilities.  ","go to bed at a reasonable time. don't sleep with the lights on. clear your mind with relaxation techniques. sleep on your right side. design your room to be conducive to sleep. remember that beds are for sleeping. let go of your worries. don't hit the snooze button. take in morning light. get flowers. take a warm shower and finish with a cooling rinse. start off with yoga or stretching. don't rush. find the positive. remind yourself of the aspects of your life where you feel the most fulfilled. view your work as meaningful. find things to look forward to every day. embrace pma. build a positive self-image.

"Use a tape measure to get the length and the width of the space where you will keep your stackable washer and dryer, to make sure you buy one that fits. Most models are from 24 to 27 inches (61 to 68.6 cm) wide, and from 70 to 75 inches (177.8 to 190.5 cm) high.;  ,, Any compact washer and dryer can be purchased separately and stacked on top of one another, but that may not be safe. Make sure you select a model that is labeled as stackable. Washers are typically on the bottom of the unit, with dryers on the top.  When buying a stackable washer and dryer, make sure you can reach the dryer. Practice opening and reaching into the dryer to make sure loading and unloading laundry will be easy. If you cannot find a stackable unit that you can reach, consider getting a small stool to help you reach into the dryer.  Stackable models come with washers that load in the front of the machine, or on top of the machine. Front loading washing machines spin faster, which takes more water out of the clothing and linens, cutting down on drying time.  The sensor detects the amount of moisture in the load, and will shut off automatically when the load is dry. The price will be higher than models with a thermostat sensor, which will measure air temperature in the drum of the dryer. However, the moisture sensor will save energy and help protect your laundry from extra wear and tear.  If conservation and green energy is important to you, choose a model that has an Energy Star rating. If you like to do a lot of small loads of laundry, make sure you select a model that has low settings as well as high or heavy-load settings. Other considerations that depend on your preference include the placement of the lint screen in the dryer, the buzzer or bell that alerts you that the drying is complete, the simplicity of adding detergent and bleach to the washer, and how noisy the machine is when it is running.  Stackable washers and dryers can be purchased in home appliance stores, major department stores, and at home improvement centers and warehouse chains. You can also find deals online, at major retailing sites. If you are on a budget, consider checking Craigslist in your area for a used model.  Most stackable washer and dryer units come with a standard 1 year warranty. Extended warranties are often available, but they can be expensive.  Before you buy a stackable washer and dryer, look for reviews provided by customers who currently own one. Best selling brands in stores and online include Kenmore, General Electric, and Whirlpool.  ","measure the space you have. note whether your dryer will need to be powered by electricity or gas. , look for units labeled as stackable. consider your own height. save water and electricity with a front loading washer. look for a unit that includes a moisture sensor in the dryer. consider the additional features that are important to you. shop around for the best prices and selections. inquire about warranties. research consumer reviews online.

"First thing's first. Can you tell that you're addicted? Here are four questions to determine if you are or are not addicted. (It may or may not be a strong addiction)  When you see your computer (closed or opened), do you feel an urge to go to MapleStory?  Does MapleStory distract you from anything? (Learning, classes, etc.)  Do you often go to Maple only? Maybe you talk (or desire to talk) to your friends about maple almost 24/7?  Is MapleStory affecting your grades? Look at your report card. If you're getting D- to C on any grade, this may be a good idea to quit;  , How so? There can be people that have an uncontrollable lust to play everyday. People always competing to be the top. That could ruin your life for good. You could be too distracted to the desire to play. Some people could have easily failed their classes because of that. (Happened to me) So think. Don't ruin your life. You get no second chance.  After admitting, you should set goals. You don't have to quit to get over your addiction. Maybe play lesser a week. For example on setting a goal: I will play three times a week in # hours.  Try following it. It might be hard at first but you'll get the hang with it. Try using other hobbies to occupy yourself. Don't feel discouraged if you didn't do exactly what you had intended. If you stopped a bit you've made progress!  , Replace those negative terms with positive terms.

"This form is simply a guide for when to play certain chords. Each bar (or count of '1,2,3,4, 1,2,3,4, 1...') is assigned a chord, and together they form the melodic backbone of 95% of blues songs. To make it, you simply take the first (I), fourth (IV), and fifth (V) chords of the major scale and make them into chords. Once you know the form in one key, like 'E,' you can then easily transpose the song into any key you want. For the key of E, your chords are E, A, and B.  While the following article uses easy to form power chords, you can also uses seventh chords, minor chords, or minor sevenths.  Before beginning, make sure you review the major and minor scales for guitar.  The blues are in simple 4/4 time, like almost all radio songs. If this is a struggle, review rhythm and time signatures.  ;  , Use a 'swung', chugging rhythm to give the song a blues feel — your strums should sound like 'dun da-dun da-dun da-dun...' It can help to listen to early blues recordings like Robert Johnson's 'I Believe I'll Dust My Broom' to get this rhythm down.br>  If you count out, like '1 and, 2 and, etc,' think of a big strum down on the number, then a quick upstroke for 'and.'  If this is difficult at first, start with a strumming pattern that works for you until you get the progression down.  The first chord you play is going to be the key of the song. So, if you start with an E, your songs will be a twelve bar blues in the key of E. You'll hold this E for four full bars.  It always helps to practice with a metronome to ensure you play each measure the correct number of times.  Next, in a 12-bar blues, you play the fourth of the starting chord for two measures before returning to the starting chord. Since A is three notes above an E in the major scale, it's the IV chord in the key of E.  The last four bars of a 12-bar blues are called 'the turnaround.' In the turnaround, you play the fifth, the fourth, the starting chord, and then repeat the fifth one more time. B is the fifth of E since it is one note above A, the fourth, so we play B, then A, then E, then B again.  That's all there is to a basic 12-bar blues — just play E-E-E-E-A-A-E-E-B-A-E-B until the song's over (note that, when they're performed live, most 12-bars have a special ending that will vary from song to song.) To get the full 12-bar experience, try getting a friend who's more experienced at guitar to solo over your chords — with a little practice, you should soon get the hang of this simple but important blues progression.  To play in a different key, simply pick a different starting chord and shift the fourth and fifth accordingly. For instance, if you want to play in the key of C, you'll use C as your starting chord, F for the fourth, and G for the fifth. You can find a good guide for playing the 12-bar in different keys here.  Looking to spice up your progression? Check out Wikihow's ways to spice up your riff.  Real blues musicians often use a special kind of chord called a '7' chord (or a 'dominant 7th chord') to make the song sound a little 'bluesier.' These chords are the same as major chords, but with one note different. For a quick rundown of how to finger the most common 7 chords, click here.  You have two options when you substitute 7 chords into a 12-bar blues: you can either change the fifth to a 7 chord (for instance, in the key of A, E would become E7), or you can change every chord to a 7 chord (in the key of A, A would become A7, D would become D7, and E would become E7.) Different options sound better for different songs, so try experimenting to find the chords you like.  ","use the 12-bar blues chord progression as the backing of any blues song. alternate a big downstroke and a quick upstroke when strumming for a 'shuffle' feel. play an open e, the i chord, for four measures. play open a (the iv chord) for two measures, return to then e for two measures. play b-a-e-b, each for one measure to end the progression. repeat ad nauseum. substitute 7 chords for a bluesy feel.

"Most of the information that a social worker incorporates into a social work assessment comes from direct reports from all parties involved with a case.  Begin by interviewing the person who is seeking services. If possible, interview family members, former case workers, physicians, teachers, and other people who you can inform you of your client’s situation.;  , You can add to your information by consulting important documents. These might include psychiatric, educational, vocational or medical tests as well as agency records.  Keep a record of all sources used for your assessment. In the assessment you will want to record who you interviewed, any incidents you were able to observe, and any documents you consulted. , The most important part of the assessment process is creating a rapport with your client and other interviewees that would encourage them to divulge information honestly. Focus on obtaining information about the client’s needs and the resources that would help fulfill those needs.Create a safe atmosphere when conducting interviews by explaining the rules of confidentiality to the interviewees. In general, all information obtained in the interview will remain a part of the report and that you will not share the information with people who are not involved with the case.  To elicit positive responses, focus on finding the strengths of the client. Do not apportion blame. Negotiate with the client over a mutually agreed assessment.When you encounter resistance, be optimistic so as not to discourage your client. Continue to be polite, punctual, and attentive. Refrain from using jargon., These require the person to respond with detailed answers. Questions requiring only a yes or no answer will not produce enough information for you to write an assessment that can be used to set goals and determine a treatment plan. For example, instead of asking if the client is angry with another individual, ask them to explain how they feel about them.  Have an assessment form on-hand during your interviews. Assessment forms include specific questions. Using an assessment form will help focus your interview and allow you to take thorough notes.

"Because defining your personal values require you to really tap into yourself, make sure that you have your own space to think about them.Try turning off your phone, listening to soothing music, or doing anything else that helps you relax and focus on the present moment.;  , Only include memories that had the most impact on your life and sense of well-being rather than those that earned you the most praise or recognition from others.  For example, a time of great happiness might be when you had a spectacular night of bonding with a close friend. It may not have been a crowning achievement, but you may have learned a lot about your personality and how to bond and share with another person.  Look for the themes that run through your most charged memories, good and bad. These may also be informed by your spirituality or political leanings. In all likelihood, you will find a few things that provoke extreme feelings of injustice, sadness, anger, or all of these. Notice what was missing and try to find this value in your happiest moments.  We all have relatively similar, very basic needs that come from our bodies' constitutions and the evolution of human culture.The things that we value ultimately stem from our needs--this is why we are so passionate about and committed to our values! Examining human needs will give you a powerful push to tap into your own personal values. More or less universal needs include:  Physical well-being (i.e. food, rest, safety touch)  Autonomy (i.e. choice, dignity, self-expression)  Peace (i.e. acceptance, hope, ease of mind)  Meaning (i.e. celebration, participation, understanding)  Connection (i.e. warmth, respect, consideration)  Play (i.e. adventure, humor, joy)  , Include the values that most deeply strike you as impossible to live without honoring. Here, you can bridge your personal experiences with your culture's values, as well as the universal human needs defined by our biological makeup.  Make sure your wording holds strong personal resonance for you. For instance, if you value being able to motivate yourself and complete tasks without help, you might want to write this as 'I value the strength of independence and individuality.' Similarly, if you value helping anyone who needs it, you may instead want to say 'I value being of service to my fellows unconditionally and without judgment.'  Try starting off with 7-10 values, knowing that it may eventually be more helpful to narrow these down to 3-4 primary decision making guides.  Values are different from the strategies you use to see them through. Oftentimes, these strategies come from your family of the faith you were raised with. By knowing how you are inclined to enact your values you will have greater insight into the values that lead you to do things you are most proud of.  For instance, you may have the value of being appreciated in your society. But, do you enact this value by wearing designer clothes to increase your status or by becoming a human rights activist? If you value a deep sense of peace and order, do you organize your home and diffuse essential oils? Or, maybe you resolve conflicts that arise in your family? Make these connections between your values and your daily life.  One way to confirm your sense of what your values are is to spend a day watching what makes you tick. If you have a high priority value and enter a situation in which that value is threatened, you will feel anxious, vulnerable, or even angry. Something that you hear about or see on the news may also make you tick.For example, you might be told by your boss that your new tank-top is inappropriate to wear at work. Instead of simply moving on after a brief moment of frustration, you might feel very angry or on edge. If this is the case, you may reason that two of your most cherished personal values are acceptance and autonomy.  This test will work in either real or imagined decision-making situations. Say you value independence, and you're considering moving in with your significant other. What sorts of options are available to you, given your value? If you value rest and spontaneity, but you work a job that requires 70-hour weeks, how will you avoid stress and internal conflict? In these types of situations, understanding your values can really help make creative decisions that reflect your own self-careBe aware that you will be able to see your value in action most powerfully while making a real decision. Sometimes we are so enamored with a particular value that we imagine it will always lead us to the best decisions when this is not necessarily the case.  If you are in certain situations make it difficult for you to uphold a personal value, think carefully about whether or not to speak out. Are you unable to live according to your value because of something that can be changed, or must you leave the situation altogether? What value is being threatened, and why?  Say you are in a relationship with someone who does not appreciate your hard work, and you strongly value being acknowledged for your efforts. Is this something you can resolve by talking? Can you enact your value of being acknowledged in other parts of your life? Is it possible to expand your sense of being acknowledged to include the unique way your partner expresses appreciation?  Another possibility is that you are moved to speak out against an issue or cause in your community. Perhaps you are disturbed by funding cuts to public schools--is this something you'd like to know more about or get involved with in some other way? It may be that your value of care for future generations is one that calls for action.  These values should be rooted in your initial inclinations about what's important to you. In addition, integrate what you have learned from journaling about and testing your values in various settings. Aim to list and clearly define 3-4 main values.  Remember, these values are powerful tools for getting you through this portion of your life. Personal values can change from one part of life to the next. This is because your values are powerful components of you, meaning that they should change and grow as you do!  , Unlike norms and attitudes, values form an ordered system of priorities. This means that you may find that you have values that compete for priority in your life. Not only is this not problematic, but it can even make life all the more interesting. By looking at your list of values and drawing lines connecting the ones that could potentially conflict, you are gaining insight into what creates fruitful tension in your life.  For instance, you might value having your own space and unconditionally supportive relationships. If this is the case, you'll know that ensuring your own space must be carefully managed alongside your other value to support friends or loved ones whenever the need arises. While balancing these potentially conflicting values can be tricky, knowing this in advance will help you make better decisions.  ","clear space for some 'you' time. write down times of your greatest happiness and sadness.recall the peaks and valleys within your experiences, making note of the details and feelings surrounding each memory. consider values found throughout humanity. outline an initial list of personal values. journal about how you typically enact these values. watch what makes you tick. test your values by looking at the decisions they produce. decide what you will speak out against. create a final list of personal values. make note of conflicting values.

"Open and closed ended leases operate in very much the same manner throughout the life of the contract. The difference between the two lies in what happens upon the end of the agreed upon timeframe. Closed end leases are more common for consumers, as you can simply return the car at the completion of the contract with no additional financial responsibilities unless the vehicle requires repairs.You are responsible for this balloon payment regardless of the actual value of the car at the end of the contract.;  , When signing an open ended lease, you are agreeing to pay a balloon payment of the remainder of the anticipated value of the car at the end of the lease, which means you run the risk of losing value. By agreeing to an open ended lease, you are promising to pay the sum of money at the end of the contract, regardless of the actual value of the car by then.If the value of the car is higher than predicted at the end of your lease agreement, you may gain value by buying out the lease.  If the car is worth less than anticipated, you are still responsible to pay the balloon payment dictated at the signing of the lease.  If you are concerned that you may end up having to pay more than the car is worth in the end, an open ended lease may not be right for you.  There are different leasing options available to you based on what you intend to use the car for and how long you hope to keep it. Open ended leasing is often used for businesses as opposed to consumers because of the balloon payment required at the end, but may offer advantages to you based on your situation.Think about how much mileage you intend to put on your car. Closed ended leases will give you mileage limits, with financial penalties for exceeding them. Open ended leases have no mileage limits.  Consider whether or not you hope to keep the car you lease. If you do not, a closed ended lease would make more sense for you.  You cannot usually lease used cars, so you will need to choose a new vehicle that you are interested in leasing and ultimately owning. Consider what you will be using your vehicle for and use that to help narrow down your choices.If you are going to be transporting people or goods, consider the storage available in cars, SUVs or trucks. Depending on what you will be carrying, you may need to choose one over the others.  If you are going to be driving a significant number of miles, you may want to consider gas mileage when choosing a new vehicle. Many cars, trucks and SUVs come with different engine options that offer different fuel economy so make sure to research the vehicle you choose.  Consider all of your options when determining what the right car is for you.  Once you have identified what you intend to you use your new vehicle for and how much you intend to drive it, you should determine a range of monthly prices that you are able to afford. You will likely end up paying more than the total cost of the car by leasing it, so also consider how much more you are willing to pay above retail price. Try creating a budget to determine how large a monthly payment you can afford.Add up your expenses and compare them to your monthly income to establish a basic budget.  Once you know how much you have in your budget to work with, use that to determine what you could afford as a monthly payment.  Use the decisions you’ve made in the previous steps to narrow down your choices to two or three cars. This will allow you compare their options, prices and benefits to determine the best choice for you. Once you have narrowed down your choices, do some research online about each make and model to see if there are issues with it.  Websites like KBB.com can give you reviews on the car and Recalls.gov can let you know if there have been any recalls on that specific make and model.  Take notes if you’d like. Bring any notes you take with you to the dealership to make sure you have a thorough understanding of the cars you look at.  Visit dealerships that offer leases on the cars that you are interested in and take each car for a test drive. Pay close attention to your comfort in the car as well as your level of comfort driving and handling the vehicle. It’s important that you choose a car that you feel comfortable in and that you know you can manage.Mention anything that you aren’t sure of during your test drive to the salesperson. There may be an issue with that specific car that they can fix, or you may want to test drive a different car.  Remember not to lease the first car you test drive, although you may be tempted to do so. Instead compare more than one vehicle to get a solid sense of what you want.  Do not mention that you intend to lease the car until after you have determined the total price with the salesperson. Car dealerships often focus on monthly cost over total price, because they know you will be more apt to accept a lower monthly payment, even if the total price of the vehicle goes up.By negotiating total price before you negotiate the terms of the lease, you know what the maximum cost of your lease will be and possibly limit the size of the final balloon payment you will be expected to pay.  Your monthly lease payments will be based on your overall agreed upon price, so negotiating a total price first will ensure you know what your monthly costs will be.  Visit more than one dealership and test drive each of the cars you may want to lease. Negotiate a total price and determine what the monthly expenses may be for each.  Keep any documentation you receive from each dealership so you can accurately compare your options at home.  Don’t allow salespeople to pressure you to make a decision right away. Signing a lease is a large financial commitment, and there’s nothing wrong with taking your time.  Once you have determined the total price, ask the salesperson about leasing options. They may offer different programs with different options available to you. Be sure to specify that you intend to sign an open ended lease agreement, as the paperwork will need to reflect that instead of a more traditional consumer lease.  Some common leasing options may be the option to pay additional sums toward the final payment each month, the ability to transfer the lease to others, or even to extend the time frame of the lease if you need to.  Some companies offer leasing options that include covering more of the maintenance costs of the vehicle. These options may be valuable to you as maintaining the car properly can help keep it’s overall value high.  There may be lease options that include different durations. Remember that you will be responsible for the remainder of the value of the car upon the completion of the lease, so shorter leases will result in a higher final payment.  In order to minimize your monthly expense as well as the final balloon payment you’ll be responsible for upon the completion of the lease, put down as much as you can up front. The larger your down payment, the less you will have to pay down the road.The more you pay toward the overall cost of the vehicle, the less you will be responsible for later on.  Large down payments don’t make as much sense on closed ended leases, as you will be returning the car regardless upon the end of the lease.  The fastest and easiest way to reduce the value of your vehicle, believe it or not, is to drive it. The higher the mileage on your vehicle, the less it is worth so limit any unnecessary driving to ensure you maintain the highest possible value for your car.Only use your leased vehicle to drive to places you absolutely have to, in order to avoid putting unnecessary miles on it.  Use GPS to find direct routes to places that you go in order to avoid adding additional miles to your trips.  Your vehicle will require regular maintenance to keep it running well. Preventative maintenance can keep things from breaking that would result in costly repairs and a well maintained vehicle will retain more value than a poorly maintained one.Get oil changes at the frequency recommended in your vehicle’s owner’s manual. A common rule of thumb is to have your oil changed every 3,000 miles.  Check your user’s manual for scheduled maintenance requirements like changing your air filter, transmission fluid or oil, and fuel filters.  You will be required to maintain full coverage car insurance on your vehicle throughout the life of your lease, but you may also want to invest in GAP (Guaranteed Auto Protection) coverage. In the event your car depreciates faster than you’d hoped and you get into an accident, your insurance will only cover the value of the car, not the remainder of what you owe. Gap insurance covers that remainder.If your open ended leased car is totaled before you've completed the lease and made the final balloon payment, you are still financially responsible for the full cost of the car. GAP coverage will protect you from having to pay thousands of dollars out of pocket toward the car after an accident if it has depreciated.  You may be able to add gap insurance to your lease at the dealership when you sign the contract.  Most car insurance providers offer gap insurance at an additional cost.

"If your friend is complaining about how they look, do not automatically compliment them and tell them how great they look. Although you are trying to help, your words will not help your friend feel better about their appearance.This approach may backfire and make your friend feel like you do not understand them.  Instead of trying to cheer your friend up, listen to them and acknowledge their feelings.For example, if your friend says, “My hair looks ugly today,” you could say, “Yeah. Bad hair days happen to all of us.” That response is better than telling your friend that their hair looks great.  Helping an insecure friend can be overwhelming and take a toll on you.If you are a minor, encourage your friend to speak to a counselor, trusted adult, or a parent. If you are an adult, suggest that your friend seek the help of a professional therapist.  It is never too soon to suggest that your friend seek some outside help.  You may say, “Hey, have you ever tried talking to someone about how you feel. I think it could really help you.”Your friend will need to see a counselor if they are engaging in self-harm, abusing drugs or alcohol, has an eating disorder, or seems to be depressed.  You probably think your friend is wonderful and has no reason to be insecure. However, that does not change how your friend feels. Always acknowledge your friend’s feelings.

"College brings along all kinds of new challenges, especially in your first year. You may suddenly be very busy with classes, social activities, and studying. But, you will need to prioritize your significant other and make sure you give them an appropriate amount of time and attention.  Even though it’s important to give your boyfriend or girlfriend your attention, it will need to be a balance. You are obviously in college because you want to succeed in school, so make sure you are giving the right amount of time to all of your academic responsibilities.Sometimes, combining the priorities of school and a significant other can work, too—try having study dates, or doing homework together.;  , Similarly to making your significant other a priority and making time for them, you need to make sure you make time for yourself.  Taking time for yourself might seem like an easy thing to do, but you might find out it can be difficult! If you are having trouble making time for yourself, put it in your planner or on your calendar, and make sure not to schedule anything else during that time.  If you go to the same school, or even take some of the same classes, the two of you might begin to feel a little overwhelmed from too much time together. Make sure to pencil some alone time into your schedule., Talk to each other honestly and openly. Do not harbor any secrets or grievances. These omissions can end up weakening your bond, especially when they finally come out.  Simply talking isn’t necessarily good communication. Make sure you are really listening to your significant other rather than just waiting for your turn to speak.An advantage of living near your boyfriend or girlfriend through college is that when you communicate with them, you can also read into their body language.

"It is almost inevitable that a small business will require the services of an attorney. One mistake that many people make is that they wait too long to find the right attorney. You should begin looking for an attorney before you have an immediate need for legal services. This allows you to conduct interviews and find the right fit without the pressure of a business or legal demand requiring an attorney’s attention., Just because someone is a family friend does not mean that you should hire the person to be your attorney, even if the person offers you a discounted rate for his or her services. It is important that you choose someone who is experienced in the kind of law that you need and has time to focus on your case. If your family friend meets all of these requirements and you feel comfortable working with that person, then it would fine to hire him or her.You also need to consider the issue of confidentiality and how much you want your friend to know.  It is a mistake to choose an attorney who guarantees you a victory in your case. No attorney can promise you a victory, since ultimately a judge or jury decides the outcome of the case, but many attorney advertisements come close to doing that. If an attorney guarantees you a victory, you should investigate very carefully., All attorneys are not the same. When you are looking for an attorney, try to find someone who specializes in the kind of work that you need. When seeking a divorce, look for an attorney who handles divorce cases. If you need to file bankruptcy, look for a specialist in bankruptcy law. Don’t assume that one attorney is going to be good at everything.  If you are involved in a tort case--medical malpractice, a car accident, an assault, negligence, etc.--most states require that you file your case within two or three years of the date of the injury or from when you discovered the injury. If you wait too long, you may lose your chance to file your case.Typically, medical malpractice claims need to be reviewed by an expert physician who certifies that the physician reviewed the medical records and that the plaintiff’s injury was more likely than not caused by the defendant doctor’s negligence.As medical malpractice cases have an additional burden before you can file your case, it is a mistake to wait too long before speaking with an attorney.  While many people know the names of medical malpractice attorneys based on television advertisements, this is often not the best way to find an attorney. Often the attorneys who advertise on television don’t handle cases themselves but instead refer them to someone else. If you want to know who you are working with, you need to do careful research of the attorneys in your area by reading reviews online, seeking recommendations from friends and family, and calling local bar associations to see if any complaints have been filed against the attorney., When hiring an attorney, you should plan to meet any prospective attorney in person, share the important details of your case, and discuss your strategy. You may be required to share intimate, awkward or embarrassing details about your life and therefore you must find a person with whom you feel comfortable working. If you choose an attorney with whom you feel uncomfortable talking about your injuries or other aspects of your life, your case will most likely suffer., Another mistake people make when hiring an attorney is failing to ask that attorney all or any of the questions that the person may have. It is important to understand your legal rights, the intricacies of your case, and your attorney’s strategy. By becoming informed, you may be able to better assist the attorney in your case. Additionally, you should find an attorney who respects you and makes time to discuss your concerns. If a prospective attorney seems too busy to discuss your questions, that may not be the best choice for you., Many legal issues can be incredibly stressful and emotional. Divorces, accidents, and malpractice cases, for example, can all be upsetting and very personal. During this emotional time it may be more difficult to choose an attorney who is the right fit for you. You can reduce the chance of hiring the wrong attorney by bringing a trusted friend or family member to your initial consultation. This allows you to rely not only on your own judgment but also that of a trusted person when evaluating whether the attorney meets your needs., Many people are often shocked by the cost of legal services, especially if they hire a large law firm. While it may be in your best interest to hire a big firm, particularly if you are looking for a corporate attorney to help you grow your business, you should have a very candid conversation about fees, charges, and your legal budget. There are ways to remain on budget if you inform the law firm of the amount of money they have to work with and require constant updates about the amount of money they are spending representing your business interests.Understand that a lawyer’s fees may be negotiable. If you are working on a limited budget, but you represent steady work, a lawyer may be willing to reduce his hourly rate to get your business. Don’t shy away from asking about this possibility.  Before hiring an attorney, research the attorney’s background very carefully. Don’t just trust an advertisement or even a recommendation from a family member. Beyond just interviewing the attorney, you should ask for references to other satisfied clients, and then reach out to them. In most states it is possible to check that the attorney is in good standing with the state bar association. If the attorney has had numerous complaints filed against him or her, or if any disciplinary action has been taken, this will be on record.  A mistake people make when hiring a criminal defense attorney is that they think they should choose the most aggressive attorney they can find. You do not want to hire an attorney who tells you that he or she takes every cases to trial. While you want someone to be a zealous advocate for you, sometimes negotiating a plea agreement is in the best interest of the client. You should look for someone who is willing to go to trial if that is in your best interest but who also fully explains all of your options and helps you make an informed decision., You need to trust your instincts when meeting an attorney for the first time. If you feel pressured to sign a retainer agreement, turn over your credit card information, or hire the attorney at the first meeting, you should consider hiring someone else. This kind of pressure in an initial meeting suggests that you may not have a good working relationship further on.At some point, your attorney may have to pressure you to address a time-sensitive plea deal so that you don’t lose the opportunity. But pressuring you to make a decision about a time-sensitive matter that is important to your case is different than pressuring you for something in the attorney’s self-interest, such as agreeing to be his or her client.  You pay a lot for the legal services that you need. It is important for you to choose an attorney who can take time for you when you need it. You should not choose an attorney who appears overburdened by work or takes on more clients than he or she can handle.During the initial meeting, ask your attorney who will answer your questions when you call and how long it takes to hear back from the attorney.  Ask whether there will be other attorneys working on the case or just the attorney you meet with. If there are other attorneys, you may have a better chance of speaking directly to someone rather than waiting for a return phone call.  No matter how emotionally charged the legal matter at hand may be, your relationship with your attorney is essentially a business deal. You need to make sure that you understand the billing expectations up front, and be sure that you can abide by them.It is common for an attorney to require a retainer to be paid up front, and then subtract the time actually spent from that retainer. When the retainer is used up, then the attorney will either proceed with monthly bills or ask for another retainer. Whichever system your attorney uses, make sure you know what is expected so there are no surprises.  Many personal injury lawyers accept cases on a contingent fee basis, which means that a client does not pay for any fees or services unless the lawyer wins the case. Once the lawyer wins, the lawyer is reimbursed for all of the costs incurred in the case and also takes a previously agreed upon percentage of the winnings as his or her fee., If you have to hire lawyers with different specialties from different firms, it is important the attorneys are informing each other of potential issues that are arising. As a business owner, you can manage open communication and cost by scheduling short meetings where all of the lawyers and you are on a brief conference call providing updates on the work that that they are performing. While you are spending money to have all of the lawyers communicate regularly, it could be more costly if one of your attorneys inadvertently creates a problem for another area of your business because they were unaware of work being done by someone else., A mistake that some new business owners make is that they stay with the attorneys who handled their business start up even after their business is up and running. You may need a different type of business lawyer who handles taxes and employment issues rather than business planning and venture capital. Make sure as your business grows that you are meeting the business’s demands with the right legal specialist.  ","look for an attorney before you need one. do not rely on a family friend. be wary of attorneys who guarantee victory. look for a specialist. find an attorney promptly when you need one. do not choose a lawyer based on television advertisements. meet your attorney in person. ask questions. bring a friend to your consultation. discuss fees and your budget. research the attorney’s background. evaluate an aggressive attorney. avoid attorneys who pressure you for a decision. choose an attorney who can make time for you. be clear about billing. make sure your lawyers are communicating with each other. adjust your legal needs as your business changes.

"It may sound a little obvious, but research is important. Understand what you are dealing with! It's okay. Gaining a slight understanding of the disorder can help you understand his needs, his mood and what is happening. Bipolar is poorly understood by a lot of people, and also presents itself at various levels of severity.  Moods can change drastically in a short space of time, from on top of the world to rock bottom, sometimes with no trigger. But the frequency and length of the different episodes depend on the severity of his disorder.  There is no cure for bipolar, but there are medications and other treatments designed to help control the disorder's effects. Some people have also learned to control the disorder without the use of any such treatments.;  , Space plays an imperative part while you're dating, and a man with bipolar is no exception.  A lot of women grow concerned when they don't get a reply to a text or a call the next day, but it's imperative to remember space. Being 'clingy' is unlikely to help, especially if he is having an episode. It's important to atone to his needs as well as yours, if he needs space, ensure he gets enough.  On the other hand, too much space can also cause problems. If he has a depressive episode, it's important to let him know you're there, showing you care could help more than you realize. Furthermore, too much space could give the impression that you don't care, causing the relationship to cease altogether.  Try to strike a balance in offering support but not forcing your opinions or advice upon him.  Most people fear judgement; it's in our nature. It's incredibly important not to judge him or his disorder; it is essential that you support him any way you can, should he desire it. It is likely you will see many different sides of him, and be intense, emotional or 'heat of the moment' situations; judging him based on any of this would be incredibly unfair. Everyone has both good and bad sides, but chances are during times such as these you will see a side of him he allows very few people to see. It can be incredibly difficult for him. Learn to either embrace it or take it with a pinch of salt; it's up to you.  'Let he who has sinned cast the first stone'. Nobody has the right to judge another if it would make them a hypocrite.  Be prepared for this one. Nobody with bipolar disorder is the same, well nobody on earth is the same, but spontaneity happens, so get ready for it. This step may never affect you; his spontaneous outbursts may never affect you, but it's wise to be prepared for the unexpected. If he does come up with a sudden idea that may seem a little out of the blue, be patient with it. Give it a few days before discussing it again; it may have been a fairly fleeting thought that crossed his mind or a goal he genuinely wishes to achieve.  This step is simple and more so a chance to reiterate the importance of the previous steps. If he hasn't called, send him a text in a little while. If he hasn't asked you on a date this week, maybe he's not feeling up to it. If he hasn't opened up about his disorder, he'll do so when he's ready. But remember, he's a guy; they're all different, but many have the same habits. They'll call when they remember, take you out if they're not with the lads and talk when they want to. Patience is required, sometimes a lot of it, but it'll be worth it.  Now, this too is a crucial step. Although the above is all about him, never forget yourself. Don't get walked all over. He may have bipolar, but that doesn't mean you come last; you're just as important as he is, and if your relationship is going to thrive, you both have to work on it. You have the right to space when you need it too, you have the right to propose outrageous ideas, or have a bad day/week. Relationships are all about equality, neither should be more important than the other, you deserve respect and support just as much as he does.  ","do some research. provide the right amount of space. don't judge. embrace spontaneity. be patient. don't forget yourself. "
"Winding down in the evening is equivalent to telling your body that it’s time to call it quits for the day. You can’t expect it to go from 100 to 0 simply by getting in bed and pulling up the covers. So spend about 30-45 minutes slowly shutting down your brain and body.  You might do this by taking a hot shower or bath. When you get out, your core body temperature drops, which is a signal to your brain to produce melatonin, your body’s natural sleep hormone.Other ways to prepare for sleep are by putting away the electronic gadgets and gaming systems and, instead, reading a book, listening to classical or relaxing music or by doing easy stretches., Caffeine is a stimulant, and while most people associate it with coffee, it’s also in tea, chocolate, soda and some pain relievers. Sleep experts recommend avoiding these things for 6 hours before going to sleep.  This may seem like a really long time, but that’s how long it takes for caffeine to leave your bloodstream., When you exercise vigorously, your body temperature goes up, and it takes several hours for it to drop to normal levels again. Because lower body temperature is needed for better sleep, don’t exercise for 3-4 hours before going to sleep.On the flip side, exercising regularly promotes good sleep. The precise mechanism between regular exercise and sleep is still uncertain, but numerous studies on various populations have shown that it works., Turn off the TV, and put away your cell phones, computers and tablets once you’re in bed. They not only prevent you from winding down because you’re so busy clicking, scrolling, typing, chatting and so forth, but they also trick your body into thinking it’s daytime and, therefore, not time to go to bed.  Here’s how it works. These devices emit a type of blue light that mimics natural light, thereby suppressing melatonin levels. When this occurs, your brain tells your body it’s not time to sleep; it disrupts your circadian rhythm.TVs also emit this light, but the problem is amplified with cell phones, laptops and tablets because they are closer to your face.  Turn off all lights while you sleep. Your circadian rhythm, or inner clock, is largely regulated by exposure to light and dark, with melatonin secreted in darkness and suppressed in light. Since melatonin induces sleep, the darker your room the better.You might also want to dim the lights during those 30-45 minutes that you are powering down before bedtime as a cue to your brain that it’s almost time to go to sleep.  If you live with a roommate or there are lights that you just can’t avoid, try wearing an eye mask to block out the light.  Make sure you stick to your bedtime each night of the week. While it will be tempting to stay up late on the weekends, doing so will really throw a wrench in your internal clock and make Monday mornings rather unpleasant.  ","power down before bedtime. stay away from caffeine before bed. avoid rigorous exercise before bed. break electronic insomnia. darken your room. go to sleep the same time each night. "
"In order to be more proactive about taking your medication, you need to understand what you're taking and why. Talk to your doctor when your meds are prescribed and make sure you understand the proper regimen for taking them.  Understand exactly what you're being treated for and how each medication affects your mind and body. Do not passively accept the prescription slip. Ask your doctor what the medication does.Talk to your doctor about side effects. You should always know what side effects to watch for and when and if you should discontinue use.Ask about how to take the medications. Some medications need to be taken with lots of water. Some need to be taken with food. Some must be taken every day, while others are taken multiple times a day. Make sure you know how to properly take your medication to get the best results.Use one pharmacy for all medications so the pharmacist can check for interactions with new prescriptions.;  , Despite your best efforts, you will likely miss a dose of your medication at some point. This happens to even to the most vigilant and there is different protocol for different types of meds. Sometimes, you should double the dose the next day. Other times, you should simply continue with regular doses and watch for side effects. Make sure you know what to do in the event you miss a dose of medication., Medications need to be stored in different ways. Oftentimes, the medication bottle will have instructions for storage. Talk to your doctor about storing your meds if you have any questions.  Some medication, such as birth control, needs to be taken every day and some meds need to be taken around the same time. You may be tempted to keep your medication on hand, in your purse or wallet, but make sure this is safe first. Sometimes, medication needs to be kept at room temperature and is less effective if exposed to intense heat or cold.Medication might need to be kept at a specific temperature, which might mean it needs to be refrigerated or kept in a cool room of the house. Make sure you know what temperatures are appropriate for storing your medication., A pillbox is a storage device sold at most drug and department stores. It can be a great tool to keep track of what medication you need and when.  Pillboxes have separate compartments for each day of the week. At the beginning of each week, separate your pills into the proper dosages. Put those dosages in the pillbox, on the correct day they need to be taken.A pillbox is particularly great if you need to manage multiple medications, each with its own schedule. Simply place different medications in different sections, corresponding to the day of the week they need to be taken.  Leave reminders throughout the house in places where you know you'll look often.  Get a calendar. Large calendars are sold at most drug and department stores. Calendars can be used to jot down when to take your meds. Some calendars are sold with magnets so they can be displayed on the fridge, meaning you'll see reminders every time you want something to eat.You can also jot down any side effects on the calendar so you can track them. If these interfere with your daily activities, you should call your physician as soon as possible.  Sticky notes are also a great investment. You can buy them at any department store or print shop. Write down when you need to take your meds. Leave them places where you'll notice them throughout the day, like near the coffee pot, in the bathroom mirror, or on your front door.Small notes, written on notepad paper or index cards, are also a great tool. These can be used in a similar way as sticky notes. If you work at a desk frequently, having an index card propped up by your computer each week advising you when to take your meds can be a great reminder., You're more likely to remember your medication if it's part of an established routine. Adding taking your meds into an existing daily ritual can serve as a great reminder.  Try to take your medicine the same time each day and do so while you're doing other daily events. For example, take your medication before you brush your teeth. (But don't store your meds by the sink or you could knock over the bottle and spill them down the drain!) If you have medication that needs to be taken with food, always take it with breakfast or lunch.Many people incorporate a self-care ritual into their daily lives. Self-care is a simple, daily activity in which you take time to relax and reflect. For example, you could have hot tea, walk around the block, take a relaxing bath. If you practice self-care each day, try taking your pills just before or after your ritual., Friends and family members care about your health as much as you do. Having a trusted friend or family member remind you each day to take your medication can be helpful.  Select someone who is non-judgmental and positive. You do not want someone who is going to be hard on you if you forget. Aim for someone who's known for having a good attitude.If you live with someone, it's easy for them to remind you each day. If you do not, however, you can ask for a simple text or phone call as a reminder., Technology can be used to your advantage in regards to remembering medication. Try setting reminders using your watch, clock, phone, or computer.  Most modern cell phones and computers have a system in place where you can set reminders. If you're not sure how to use your phone or computer to set reminders, simply google instructions. You can have a song or alarm play when the time comes to take your meds.  If you have an alarm clock, you can set it to go off each day at a certain time as a reminder to take your medication. Many digital watches are equipped with alarms that can buzz or ring at specific times throughout the day.  There are many electronic medicine schedules that can be set up using the internet. The internet in general can provide a lot of helpful tools in regards to medication.  Daily emails or other reminders can be sent through an online server. There are also many websites that make automated medication schedules for you that can be generated by entering your medications, how often you need to take them, and their dosage. Schedules can be accessed online or printed out for your reference.  You can also access forums or groups on Facebook, Twitter, and other social media sites that allow you to discuss medications and any issues you're having with other patients. Be aware that such sites should never replace medical advice; however, they can be a good place to go for emotional support and tips on how to remember to take meds. The primary conversation regarding medication should be with your doctor. If you hear about something online that you'd like to try (from herbal supplements to altering your dosage to anything else regarding your health) speak with your doctor before proceeding.  You can find many sites online that allow you to enter your phone number or email address alongside information about your medication schedule. They use this information to send texts, phone calls, or emails reminding you to take your pills. Some fees may apply, depending on the service. Check with your healthcare provider. Some hospitals provide reminders, free of charge, for their patients.  ","talk to your doctor about how to take your medication. understand what to do if you miss a dose. know how to safely store your medication. use a pillbox. place reminders in a visible place. incorporate your medication into daily activities. have family members or friends remind you. set electronic reminders. use electronic medicine schedules online. sign up for a text, call, or e-mail reminder service.

"Some painkillers are anti-inflammatory and can help reduce pain as well as swelling. However, avoid aspirin, as it may thin your blood and make the bruise worse.  Arnica is an herb that reduces inflammation and can help reduce the appearance of bruises quickly. It is available in cream or gel form at most drug stores. Apply a coating to the affected area twice daily until the bruise goes away.  If you have the stomach for it, and you can find a holistic medicine supply store that sells live leeches, you can place a live leech directly on the bruise. It will suck the blood off the top layer of the bruise immediately. Because the leech's saliva is somewhat numbing, you won't feel any discomfort during this process.  ","take acetaminophen or ibuprofen, but not aspirin. apply arnica ointment or gel daily. let a leech suck on the bruise. "
"Always use warm water, as hot water can dry out your scalp and also cause color to fade. You should only shampoo and condition your hair every few days.

It will be much easier to blow dry your bangs if they are already somewhat dry. You don't want water to be dripping off of your hair--try using your fingers and towel to get it about 75% dry.;  , You should only need a tiny bit, less than a dime-size drop. This little drop should be enough product to run through all your hair, and you should only use a tiny fraction of it on your bangs. Too much product in your bangs--whether it's a volumizing serum or styling spray--can weigh your bangs down and make your hair look greasy.  If you have curly hair, you may want to apply an anti-frizz serum so the heat from the blow dryer doesn't make your hair frizzy.  Your hair is at its most fragile when it's wet, and you risk damaging and breaking the strands if you're trying to yank through knots and tangles as you dry.  Use a clip to section your hair away from your bangs.

"Any type of rope, from cotton to nylon will work. However your choice depends on the strength needed, durability required, and the cost. Smaller rope that is 1/4' to 3/8' (6.35mm to 9.52mm) diameter is suitable for sheep and goats.;  , Note that the method you select depends on your wishes and the type of rope being used. Failure to finish the rope ends will result in fraying and un-laying.  Temporarily finish the other end of the rope with tape or string.  You will need to form a crown knot into this end after the halter is completed.  Refer to this length as the short end of the rope. The remaining length is the long end.  Grasp the rope at the 12' to 15' (30.5cm x 38cm) mark between your thumb and first two fingers (fore and middle) of both hands.  Separate your right and left hands by around 2' (5cm) apart.  Rotate the rope clockwise with your right hand and counterclockwise with your left. This will open the strands of the rope between your hands.  Use your right hand to insert the whipped end of the short end of the rope under the strand opening until the loop formed has an eye opening of around double the diameter of the rope.  Grasp the eye loop and the single strand running across the short end of the rope between your left thumb and forefinger.  With your right thumb and forefinger, grasp the short end of the rope at a point near the eye loop.  Twist the eye-loop and short end of the rope with your hands until you have isolated two strands between your right thumb and forefinger.  Pull it completely through until there's no slack. If you have done it properly up to now, one side of the loop will show three strands lying smoothly side-by-side. This is important because they will be positioned against the animal's face.  Two inches farther from the whipped end, grasp it in the same manner in your right hand (your hands should be 2 inches apart, the left closest to the short end than the right).  Open the strands by twisting clockwise with your right hand and counterclockwise with your left.  When the strands are opened wide, push your hands together. This will cause the strands to buckle and fold over, forming three loops.  Use your right hand to feed the long end of the rope into the loops, starting at the one closest to the eye loop. Remove the stick from one loop at a time as you run the long end of the rope through them.  This completes the halter!  , Consider making a crown knot at the end because a crown knot and back splice creates a convenient handle.  Do not use a hog ring to finish the end since it could catch and tear the skin of your hand.  ","select a 12' to 15' (feet) (3.6m to 4.5m) length of half-inch (1.27cm) three-stranded rope. finish one end of the rope by whipping it, clamping it with a ferrule, dipping, or heat-treating it. mark a point with your hand about 12 to 15 inches (30.5cm to 38cm) from the whipped end of the rope. place the short end on your right and the long end on your left. isolate any one of the open strands with your thumb and index finger of your left hand. position the rope so that the eye loop is on your left hand with the short end pointing towards 3 o'clock and the long end pointing towards 6 o'clock. use your left hand to insert the long end of the rope from the bottom up under and through these two strands. with the eye loop in your right, grasp the short end of the rope between your left thumb and forefinger about 2 inches (5cm) from the whipped end. line these three loops up in order and work a sharpened stick of the same diameter of the rope into the loops. run the long end of the rope into and through the eye of the loop. permanently finish the long end of the rope halter in the manner you choose.

"Whole grains provide greater fiber than refined carbohydrates such as white bread, and also are generally more healthy for you. Whole wheat, bran, barley, oats, and buckwheat have some of the highest fiber content.Simply switching your morning toast or bagel from white bread to a rich whole grain variety will enable you to get more fiber at breakfast.;  , If you normally start your day with a bowl of dry cereal, switching to a high-fiber brand is a good way to get more fiber at breakfast.

"Primer creates a base for the rest of your makeup to stick to, meaning you can apply less and achieve a more optimal effect. Foundation will help even out your skin tone, and concealer will hide blemishes and discoloration. The key is to apply each sparingly.  Put a small dollop of primer on your finger and apply a thin layer all over your face.Give it a moment to dry, and repeat the same process with your foundation.  Only use concealer where necessary, such as to cover dark spots under the eyes, on blemishes, and to cover spots, flaws, veins, or redness. Apply small dabs of concealer where necessary, then blend with your finger.To set everything in place, consider applying a thin layer of finishing powder, which will help your makeup last longer and prevent oiliness.;  , The tricks with blush are choosing the right color, applying it in the right spot, and not putting on too much. Take a blush brush and dab it into your blush once or twice only.  Use sweeping strokes to apply a thin layer to your cheekbones.  Blow the excess makeup off the brush and then blend the blush into your skin until the lines completely disappear., For a basic everyday look, stick with pink shades, a natural gloss, or a cream lipstick that’s similar to your natural lip color. The trick with lipstick is to blend it into your lips with your finger after applying it, because this will soften the look.  If you find you’ve put on too much lipstick and want to get some off without starting over, take a piece of paper and give it a kiss with your full lips. Don’t blot lipstick with facial or bathroom tissue, as these leave white fibers on your lips., With a liquid or pencil eyeliner, apply a thin line of liner to the lash line on your top lashes. Try to get as close as possible to the lash line to keep the look subtle. For some extra definition, gradually make the line a little thicker in the middle, but taper it off to a thin line at the inner and outer corners.  To extend the length of your eye, slightly extend the liner beyond the outer corner, following the direction of your lashes.  For definition on the bottom eye lid, choose a liner that’s lighter than the one you used on the top, otherwise you will create an overly dramatic look. Be sure to keep the line thin and right at the lower lash line.  Instead of eyeliner, you can also use a thin line of powder eyeshadow as eyeliner., After eyeliner comes mascara, and the trick to mascara is making sure that it’s not so thick that it’s clumpy and unnatural looking. Pull the wand out of the bottle and, starting at the base of your top lash line, zig zag the wand back and forth across your lashes as you work your way toward the lash tips.  For a subtle look, only apply one or two coats. If necessary, go back with a clean wand or brush to brush out any clumps.  If you like, you can also apply a coat to the bottom lashes in the same way, but make sure it’s a light coat.  You can wear a full face of makeup without overdoing it, and this even includes wearing eyeshadow. But to do this, you must use colors that complement your undertone and that are appropriate for your skin tone, and you must blend all the colors together.  Choose a color for your eyeshadow and select a base shade, a lighter shade, and a darker shade.  Apply the base shade all over your entire upper lid, then do a couple swipes with the lighter shade just below your brow. Use the darker shade in the crease to add definition. Blend all the colors with a clean brush.  If you are going to wear eyeshadow, eyeliner, and mascara, be sure to apply them in that order.  You don’t want to draw your eyebrows on, as that will look overly dramatic and noticeable. Instead, you want to give some extra depth, shape, and color to them. Use the natural shade and shape of your eyebrows to guide you.  With a brow pencil that’s similar to your natural eyebrow color, apply short strokes of color to your eyebrows, then work the color through with an eyebrow brush or comb., If you went with a natural look for your eyes, you can get away with a brighter and bolder choice for your lips without overdoing your makeup.  Steer clear of darker colors like brown and magenta, and instead go with brighter reds and pinks.If you're going for a bold color, apply the lipstick with a lip brush, as this will prevent streaks, which are much more noticeable with a bright color., Your undertone is the color of your skin beneath the surface layer, and this never changes. Some colors complement each other better than others, so choosing makeup that doesn’t match your undertone can make you look ill, and it can make your makeup look very apparent and unnatural. Plus, your makeup won’t flatter your features the way it should when it’s the wrong color.  When you have a cool undertone, you tend to burn quickly in the sun, look best in silver jewelry, and have blue veins at the wrist.When you have a warm undertone, you tend to bronze in the sun, look better in gold jewelry, and have green veins at the wrist.  Neutral is the third undertone, and this means you'll look good in gold and silver, and will have blue-green veins at the wrist., When choosing a foundation, you want it to match your skin and complement your undertone. Using a foundation that’s the wrong shade will make your makeup look obvious and fake. Similarly, with a concealer, opt for a shade that’s just one or two shades lighter than your foundation.  Choose a lightweight foundation as well, otherwise your makeup will look thick and pancake-like. Lightweight foundations come in the form of liquids and powders. To identify them, look for words like “light,” “bare,” and “nude,” which denote that the foundation will provide light coverage.  When testing foundations, test it on your jawline to make sure it will match the skin on your face and not stand out against your neck.  Look for foundation in shades of cocoa, porcelain, rose, or sable if your undertone is cool. Go for golden, tan, caramel, chestnut, or beige if you're warm. If you have a neutral undertone, opt for nude, buff, ivory, or praline., One of the best ways to avoid overdoing makeup is to choose eyeliner and eye shadow colors that are neutral or that only have a hint of non-neutral color.Moreover, if you go neutral and natural with your eyes, you can get away with a bolder color on your lips, and vice versa.For instance, brown eyeliner will be less dramatic than black, but you can use a red-brown if that color complements you and brings out your eyes. And if you stick with neutral browns for the eyes, consider a brighter and more vibrant shade for your lips.  To choose colors based on your undertone, stick with blues, purples, greens, beiges, pinks, and berry colors if you're cool. If you're warm, go for earth tones in reds, yellows, browns, greens, and peaches. People with neutral undertones can wear all these colors, but the most complementary will be raspberries, lemons, and lavender shades., Just as the colors in your clothing outfits should match or complement each other, so too should your cosmetics colors, especially when it comes to blush and lipstick.  To wear blush and lipstick without overdoing it, it’s important to choose makeup shades based on how fair or dark your skin is. The paler your skin, the lighter your makeup should be; similarly, the darker your skin, the darker your makeup can be.  For fair skin, try blush and a complementary lipstick (in the same color family) in plum or light pink. For dark skin, go for tangerine or raisin. For olive skin, try rose or bronze.  ","apply primer, foundation, and concealer. put on some blush. put on lipstick. put on a bit of eyeliner. apply some mascara. put on some eyeshadow. give your eyebrows definition. go bolder with your lips. determine your undertone to pick the right colors. pick an appropriate foundation and concealer. go for neutral and complementary colors for eye makeup. select complementary blushes and lipsticks.

"For jig fishing, purchase a heavy action or extra-heavy action rod. A stronger rod will handle large fish better and hold up if your line gets caught in the heavy cover (e.g. seaweed) that they often hide in. Shop for a fishing rod at your local sporting goods store to properly gauge the feel and sturdiness of different models. , Purchase a heavy braided fishing line of 50 pounds or more for jig fishing to avoid breaking. Heavier lines will not stretch, allowing you to pull in bigger fish more efficiently. A sturdier line will also stand up to thick cover like heavy vegetation and be easier to free if it gets stuck., If possible, try to use jigs that resemble the prey of the fish you are trying to catch (e.g. smaller fish local to the body of water). Jigs come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and colors. To start, buy an assortment of jigs to experiment with, and to use in different water temperatures and with different types of cover.  ","buy a heavy-duty fishing rod. use a sturdy fishing line. choose realistic-looking jigs. "
"In order to lengthen the life of your cut flowers, you need to make sure that the container you keep them in is as clean as possible and free from any bacteria that might kill off your flowers early. Usually, scrubbing the vase with warm water and mild detergent is adequate, but if you know that previous flowers in the vase had a disease or if the vase looks especially dirty, use bleach. Scrub the inside using a bottle brush and follow by soaking it.  If your vase is dishwasher safe, you can also run it on a normal dishwashing cycle. You should verify that the vase can withstand such hot water before attempting it, however.;  , Your garden shears will be the first surface to come into contact with the delicate interior of the freshly cut stems, making it essential that they are clean and free from harmful bacteria. Wipe the blades using a rag soaked in a little bleach or alcohol. Rinse the sterilized blades under hot water.  Roses last longest when they are cut immediately after the bud stage, when the petals are starting to open. Rose varieties with many petals, such as the Moonstone variety, should be cut at a more open stage, while rose varieties with fewer petals, like the Silverado, should be cut closer to the bud stage.  Then, that night, give the rose bush a thorough watering, drenching the soil completely so that the roses have plenty to drink. The more water your roses absorb by the following morning, the longer the roses will last after being cut.  Anytime from daybreak to 10:00 AM should work, but after that point, the weather begins heating up too much. Hot, sunny weather deprives your roses of substance, drying them out and making them weaker. On especially hot days, you should make it a point to cut your roses as early as possible.  Alternatively, you can also cut your roses in the evening. If the roses are watered in the morning or if they receive a great deal of morning dew, cutting them in the evening, after the weather has cooled and the roses have had a chance to recover, can also work sufficiently well.  Using your clean shears, cut the rose stems at roughly a 45 degree angle. Cutting the roses at an angle prevents the stems from resting flat in the vase, which could prevent them from drinking all the water they need, resulting in an early death. Cut the stems low to the ground, leaving plenty of stem to work with for you to resize appropriately later on.  This does not need to be your vase. Instead, you should use a bucket with a large enough opening for you to work inside. All further cutting should be done inside this bucket of water to prevent air bubbles or embolisms from emerging inside the stems.  Bacteria and rot can fester in leaves the sit in still water. You still need to leave the foliage above the water line, approximately the top half to the top third, intact. Otherwise, the roses will be unable to draw up water.  Make an angled cut underwater, similar the first. This cut will determine the final length of the stems and the final height of your roses. Temporarily remove the flowers from your bucket of water and measure them against the side of the vase to determine where to make the necessary cut. Once you have chosen the spot, return the flowers to the bucket and cut them beneath the water.  Use warm water. You can either use commercial rose food or make your own plant food by using 1 Tbsp (15 ml) vinegar, 1 tsp (5 ml) sugar, and 3 to 5 drops of household bleach per 1 liter (1 quart) of water.Bleach is especially useful in preventing harmful bacteria from attacking the freshly cut roses. Thoroughly dissolve the plant food before adding the roses.  Transfer the roses into your vase and sit the vase in a cool, dark room so that the water can thoroughly nourish the roses. Do not allow the blooms to get wet, however.  The roses must chill at approximately 38 degrees Fahrenheit (3 degrees Celsius) for at least two hours or until you are ready to gift them or display them.  If possible, change the water daily to rid the roses' environment of bacteria. Frequently changed fresh water will help make the roses last longer.  Avoid using softened water that contains salt since salt can hurt your roses.  ","clean the vase you plan to put the roses in. clean the shears. choose the right roses. water the roses.if possible, make sure you know which morning you will cut your roses on the night before. cut the roses in the early morning. cut the roses to remove them from the bush. move the cut roses to a bucket of warm water. cut off leaves below the water line. make a second cut. fill your vase with water and plant food. allow the roses to sit in the conditioned water for one hour. transfer the roses into the refrigerator. change the water frequently.

"It is best to do so on days when things are supposed to be slow. Taking a mental health day when things are going to be busy is probably not the best idea.;  , Whether it be school, work, whatever, get ahead. Work extra hard for a couple of days beforehand, and make sure you are ahead of schedule.  Don't take a mental health day when you know you have a lot of work piled up, or when you know you really should be there. Even on a day when nothing important is happening, arrange with a friend or coworker to pick up your missed work, and have them fill you in on anything that happened afterwards. It is crucial that this doesn't happen on the day of your mental health day, because it makes the whole point of taking the day off moot.  Sounds kind of like a contradiction, right? Wrong. The goal with a mental health day is to sleep enough and not leave the house for anything you don't want to do(on the most basic level) Plan what you intend to do, that way you know what you're expecting. You want to get that DIY chore done, or clean out the closet? Fine. You want to lay on the couch all day, watching bad sitcoms and eating ice cream? Fine. You want to wake up, and spend the entire day completely bored out of your mind? So not fine. Being bored does nothing for your mental health, it just annoys you and prevents you from getting anything accomplished, physically or mentally.  If the goal of your mental health day is to not leave the house all day, then you need to make sure you have everything you will need to keep yourself occupied, fed, and comfortable. If you want to go to the manicurist and the spa and the pool, then set up reservations, plan it out, make sure your car has enough gas, and try to pay in advance. Spending money is hardly ever relaxing, at least for most people.  It makes you feel good in general.  ","figure out when you want your mental health day to be. get ahead in your work. be responsible. plan your relaxing day. plan, plan, plan. try to eat healthy. "
"Jesus meant poor in terms of the inner self, and not the outer self. Outer poverty does not lead automatically to inner happiness. Those who let go of outer attachments, can simply exist and find a way to inner contentment in God.;  , Suffering in and of itself does not lead to happiness. However, those who can take suffering in their lives and raise themselves through spiritual exercises, can find solace in inner peace. Mourning can help to let go, but one should not allow the self to be overwhelmed by grief. Grief is not the center of life, rather inner peace.  Those who can greet their fellow beings with non-violence and placidity, can live in a relaxed and peaceful way and relinquish into a cosmic consciousness. Those who are at peace with all things, are at peace with themselves.  Righteousness means rightness (correctness) in the Bible.To long for a correct life, means to long for a life in the light. Those who long for happiness and search for it in the right places will receive it one day.  Those full of empathy, will feel with all other people. Those who love their enemies receive inner harmony. Those who love all other beings get a cosmic consciousness, enlightenment and holiness. They will experience the mercy of God.  To dissolve inner tension, exercises for the body using yoga, going, meditation and exercises for the spirit through reading, reflecting, positive thinking are required. Those who exercise spiritually enough will reach enlightenment one day. They will feel and see the light of God in the world, in all beings and in themselves.  Make peace in yourself and in the world. Inner peace is the first step to enlightenment. You will find God in inner silence. Work for a world of love and peace as a world saver. You will find God in the love of all beings. Peace and love are the two big steps to enlightenment. Those who are enlightened can be called holy, a son or daughter of God.  The ego can be interpreted as Satan or sin. He who sacrifices his ego will be in the light. Without a sacrifice, the breakthrough to enlightenment cannot be made. Those who live strictly according to the Sermon on the Mount, provide such a spiritual sacrifice, because it is causing difficulties in their everyday. Correct to sacrifice is a great art. Who sacrifices wrong, gets inner tensions. Who sacrifices properly, solves his internal tensions. By the time he becomes enlightened and lives in the light (God, positivity, paradise view of life). We should not sacrifice too little or too much. Those who go the right way will be rid of their inner conflict.  ","become a poor in spirit. take the suffering in your life. be meek. go the way of rightness. be merciful. purify yourself with spiritual exercises. be a peacemaker. let go of your ego. "
"From the beginning, there need to be clear boundaries in an open relationship. The term can mean different things for different people. You and your partner should be on the same page regarding expectations.Decide what kind of outside relationships are appropriate. For some people, casual sexual encounters are okay but not romantic entanglements. For others, it's okay to date other people.  Think about anything you wouldn't want your partner to do with someone else. Maybe mutual friends are off limits. Maybe you wouldn't want your partner to engage in a certain sex act with someone else.  Have a long, serious discussion to establish boundaries that work for both of you before practicing openness.  Do not jump from being strictly monogamous to an open relationship overnight. Being open is a big transition and you should take things slowly so you both have time to accept a new relationship.Even if you're allowed to see other people, do not do so before you're ready. You don't have to jump into anything simply because you can. Instead, wait until an opportunity that you feel comfortable with presents itself.  Jealousy may occur in an open relationship. It's important to address it as it arises so you and your partner can both feel safe and valued in the relationship.If you are jealous, talk about it. Talk about why you're jealous and try to figure out where it comes from. If you're serious about a non-monogamous relationship, you should address the roots of jealousy so you best know how to handle it.  Begin the conversation in a non-confrontational way. Say something like, 'Hey, I'm feeling a little jealous. Can we talk this over so our relationship stays strong?'  , It's important to stay honest throughout the relationship. An open relationship requires constant communication. You should let your partner know how you're feeling about how things are progressing and whether anything is making you feel uncomfortable or uneasy., Open relationships change over time. Periodically, have a talk with your partner about how you're feeling regarding the relationship and any changes you would like to make.Sometimes, you may think you are comfortable with something only to find you dislike it in practice. This is okay and should be discussed with your partner.  About once a month, try to have a sit down talk with your partner about your feelings on the open relationship.  Keep in mind that relationships change and grow. Your feelings may change over time, or as your relationship deepens.  ","establish clear boundaries. make the transition slowly. discuss jealousy as it arises. stay honest. revisit the situation often. "

"Use a table saw or a circular saw to cut your boards. Cutting plywood can be difficult and dangerous, so it's important to set yourself up for success.  Circular saw: choose a carbide tip blade made for plywood. Lay the plywood good side down.Table saw: invest in an 80 TPI plywood blade, designed for rip cuts.Lay the plywood good side up.  Start by cutting your long boards to the width you want. Remember that standard widths are 12' or 16'; for this project, our depth will be 12'. Push the wood through the saw at a consistent rate to ensure a cleaner cut.  Enlist the help of a friend. One of the challenges of working with plywood is that it comes in large 4' x 8' sheets,so it can be a bit difficult to handle on your own. Use saw horses or a roller table to also provide support.  Rip a piece of ¾' birch plywood into a 12½' wide strip. If you're using a circular saw, be sure to use a straight-edge guide.  Cut the strip into two 41¾' pieces to make the two bookcase sides. You can adjust this measurement up or down if you want your bookshelf to be taller or shorter.  Remember that the width of the saw blade is 1/8' and factor that into your measurements.  Rip a strip of 3/4' plywood 11⅞' wide to make the shelves.  Rip a second strip 12 1/8' to make the top and bottom shelves.  Cut the other two strips into 30½-' pieces to make the top, bottom and two shelves.  A rabbet is a groove cut into a piece of wood. In this case, creating rabbet joints will allow the top of the bookcase to sit squarely and securely on the two sides.  Set a saw to make a 3/8' cut. Cut a track into the end of the shelf by making cuts straight across the shelf in 1/8' increments until the track is as wide as the thickness of the plywood sides.  Alternately, use a router fitted with a ball-bearing-piloted rabbeting bit to make your cuts.  Since book sizes differ and your needs may change, it's best to make your shelves adjustable so that you can arrange and rearrange them as best suits you.  Clamp a pegboard (this will be your template for the holes)in place so that the first holes will be 4' above and 4' below the center shelf.  If you don't have a pegboard, you make a hole-drilling template out of ¾-inch pine cut to the same length as the bookcase sides. Use a drill/driver fitted with a ⅝-inch spade bit to bore a series of equally spaced holes in the template board. Use a drill bit that's the same diameter as the shelf-support pegs and drill holes 2' from the edge in 2' increments.  Drill approximately 1/8' deeper than the length of the pegs. Put a piece of tape or a drill stop on the bit to guide you in drilling to the correct depth and take into account the thickness of the pegboard.  ","choose the right saw. cut your sides. cut your bookshelf bottom and shelves. cut the rabbet joints. drill the holes for adjustable shelving along the bookshelf sides. "

"The hole should be placed so that it is 12' - 18' in from the rock face that you are trying to break. Use a hammer drill with a masonry bit to do this.;  , You can get it mostly cleaned out with the drill. For better results, attach a 24' long, 1/4' diameter aluminum tube to a bicycle pump. Stick the tube in the hole and blow it out by pumping the bicycle pump.  A graduated cooking shot glass works well to measure the powder.  Be sure to know the burn rate of the fuse, and use more than you think you'll need to get out of the area! Also, be sure that you have good fuse / powder connection by corkscrewing the fuse into the powder by an inch or so.  Tamp down the clay every 5 to 10 balls.  ,, A good blast will just crack the rock. Too much charge or placing the hole too near a rock face will result in 'air burst', where rock flies into the air. This is dangerous and wasteful. Too little charge, or placing the hole too far away from a rock face will result in almost no rock breakage. This method works well when you can drill a hole straight down, or close to straight down. It will not work for placing a charge in overhead rock.  ","drill a 1/2' diameter hole in the rock about 18' deep. clean out the hole. pour about 3/4 of a fluid ounce of gunpowder into the hole using a small funnel. place an appropriate length of cannon fuse in the hole. backfill the remaining hole by balling up modeling clay into 1/8' balls, dropping them into the hole, and tamping them down with a 1/4' wooden dowel. place sandbags tightly around the hole. , make sure that nobody is in the area, light the fuse, and then evacuate. , notes: you can adjust the hole depth, powder charge, and hole distance from the rock face to meet your requirements.

"If you have tried exercise and dietary changes to no avail, or if you have a medical issue that is causing your gynecomastia, you may consider breast reduction surgery. You should set up a consultation with a plastic surgeon about male breast reduction surgery to ensure it is right for your condition.You can ask your GP for a referral to a plastic surgeon who specializes in breast reduction surgery for men. You may want to set up consultations with several surgeons to find one that is right for you.  Though breast reduction surgery is an effective way to reduce your breasts, you will need to also maintain a healthy weight, balance your hormonal levels, and avoid certain drugs to reduce the chances of developing gynecomastia again.  Before you commit to breast reduction surgery, you should sit down with the surgeon and have her outline the procedure from start to finish.You will be put under general anaesthetic during the procedure, which should take around 90 minutes. Fatty tissue will be removed through an incision around your nipple. The surgeon may also make cuts down your chest to move excess tissue and then reposition your nipples.  You will need to recover overnight in the hospital and allow yourself a few days off to rest. You will also need to avoid any strenuous activity up to six weeks after the operation. You will have to wear an elastic garment after the operation to assist with healing and recovery.  Though breast reduction surgery is often very effective, the surgery can leave red and lumpy scars in the area. They may appear for several months and then fade gradually over time.You are also at risk of losing sensation in your nipples and having uneven nipples as a result of the surgery.  ","talk to your doctor about your surgical options. discuss the procedure with the surgeon. be aware of the risks associated with the procedure. "

"He will only ever be your friend: The key here is to be oblivious. When he starts dropping hints about how good you two would be together, just shrug it off with a laugh. If he tells you about how much he likes a 'girl,' but she does not seem to notice, just nod sympathetically and say 'that sucks' or 'that's too bad, you really deserve better.' Then, quickly change the subject.;  , He will start to realise that you value him as a confidante and he will be even more reluctant to wreck things by needlessly confessing his feelings.  When guys fall in love or 'like' they put the girl on a pedestal. To him, everything about you is perfect. You must destroy this pedestal and quickly. This could mean really embarrassing things like letting him see you without makeup (if you always wear it) or tell an inconvenient truth like 'I can't wait to move away after school/college/this job finishes and travel. I'd hate to get tied down!' Pretty much do the opposite of what you would do or say to a guy you have a crush on.  Just say you're too busy or you might be feeling really sick or you've already made plans. If he's really persistent, you might have to be cruel to be kind. Tell him you're going on a date.  Regular outings like shopping or team sports is great; that's the sort of thing you do with your regular friends.  If he is upset or angry or hurt, you are welcome to comfort him. Avoid hugging or anything too emotionally attached.  Tell him the dreaded 'I'm sorry, but I only like you as a friend.' Let him lick his wounds then practice steps 2-6 consistently. If he is still persistent, then its time to stop seeing him for a while.  ","remember that he is your friend. make him see the value of your friendship: talk about your boyfriend, commiserate with him over your life dramas, make it clear that you are absolutely comfortable with him because, to you, he is sexless. let him see the negative side of you: you might be prone to gossiping, hate children, really messy or you swear way too much. decline invitations to go out to dinner or anything resembling a date with just the two of you. meeting for coffee after class or work is fine, but don't do it too often. lead by example: be a good friend to him, but don't go too far. if he started this whole mess by declaring his feelings, be kind, but firm. "
"If you’ve been together for a while, it’s common for the two of you to start taking each other for granted. This is one of the most common challenges in relationships, but it doesn’t have to wreck yours.Try reflecting a few times a week on things you love about your boyfriend. Maybe it’s how he knows exactly when you’ve had a terrible day and brings you pizza and a movie. Maybe it’s how great he is at volleyball. Whatever it is that makes you love him, make an effort to think about these. Occasionally telling your boyfriend what’s so great about him is a good idea, too.  Don’t take this to the other extreme and become over-clingy, though. Constantly examining everything he does to see if he “really” loves you will only make you both anxious and stressed out. If he says he loves you, and his actions generally bear that out (remembering that everyone slips up occasionally), take him at his word.;  , It can be easy to “tune out” of conversations, especially if you aren’t really into them or you’re distracted with your own stuff. It happens to everyone. Learn to note when you zone out and practice “active listening” instead. Your boyfriend will feel more valued and acknowledged, and you might just learn some things you didn’t know.Restate and clarify what you heard. This step can save you a lot of grief, especially if you’re in an emotional conversation. Rather than assuming you heard correctly, paraphrase what you heard and ask for clarification: “Okay, let’s see if I heard you correctly. I heard you say ____. Is that right?” Then, let your boyfriend explain if you didn’t get something the first time.  Encourage. This shows that you’re into what your boyfriend’s saying. Ask little questions like “And then what happened?” or “What did you do?” You can also nod and use minimal encouragers, like “Uh-huh” or “Oh.”  Summarize. When you’ve had a conversation with a lot of info, summarize the main threads. This shows you were paying attention and offers space for any tweaks or feedback. “Okay, so you’re worried you’re going to have a really stressful day tomorrow at work, so you’d like me to pick you up after and we’ll go to the arcade tomorrow night. Right?”  These techniques are for more than just romantic relationships! They can improve your communication with anyone.  This isn’t just “What did you do today?” or “What do you want to eat?” Asking probing, meaningful questions can enrich the conversations the two of you have. It helps encourage each other to share your feelings and thoughts. Studies have even shown that asking deep questions leads to improved intimacy and feeling like you’re in love.For example, if your boyfriend is talking about a problem with one of his classes, try asking a probing question, such as “What do you think would happen if you tried ____?”  , Questions and statements that focus on “you” messages and “whys” can cause problems.These sound blaming and make the other person shut down or respond defensively.For example, it’s not a good idea to ask a question like “Why do you always forget to pick me up from school'.this just makes you sound blaming and angry and not at all attractive  Instead, use “I”-statements. You can ask questions that request legitimate information, too. For example: “I noticed you weren't there to pick me up as we had decided earlier ' This doesn’t sound accusatory (as long as you keep away from sarcasm!), but it does communicate your feelings and gives your boyfriend a space to share his.  Preaching is best left to professionals in pulpits. It’s tempting to give others advice, especially when you’re in a relationship. If someone has asked for your advice, then offer it. Otherwise, it can come across as patronizing, preachy, or like you don’t trust the other person enough to make his own decisions.Sometimes, when people ask for advice, what they’re really looking for is someone who will listen to them vent with a sympathetic ear. If you think this is happening with your boyfriend, ask: “Do you just need someone to listen, or do you want me to Try to find a fix for this?”Stay away from the “shoulds.” Nobody likes to be told “You should do this” or “You ought to do this.” It can make them feel stupid or like you’re being condescending. Instead, try something like “What about ___?” or “Have you tried ___?”  , This one is really hard. We’re all motivated by the desire to be “right” at least sometimes. In most situations, though, there really isn’t a clear “right” or “wrong.” Don’t approach a conversation with your boyfriend like it’s a battle.This doesn’t mean you don’t have a right to your emotions and thoughts. You do. How you feel is how you feel. Just remember that your boyfriend also has a right to his emotions and thoughts. There is no “right” or “wrong” with feelings. They just are. What you both control is your own responses to feelings.For example, imagine that your boyfriend comes to you and says you embarrassed him in front of his friends earlier. You may feel like that’s totally unfair, but take the time to acknowledge his feelings: “I’m sorry I embarrassed you.” Then you can explain your side: “I didn’t realize that would embarrass you. I’ll try not to do that again.”  If you start off from a place of defensiveness, the other person probably won’t hear anything past that. If you start off by acknowledging the other person’s feelings first, and then explaining when it’s appropriate, the other person will feel validated and s/he’s more likely to accept that you didn’t mean to offend.  Not insisting on being “right” doesn’t mean you have to be a pushover. If you feel strongly that something is important, talk about it. Just remember to also listen to the other person’s perspective. It may be that a compromise is the best solution.  If you don’t share the intimate, sometimes embarrassing thoughts, needs, and feelings you have with each other, your relationship can suffer.Studies show that people who don’t openly communicate their feelings and needs with others don’t feel as emotionally secure or generally happy as those who do.Studies have also shown that couples who don’t communicate openly and directly with each other are more likely to feel uncertain about their relationships.Try not to dismiss your needs, or your boyfriend’s, as “stupid” or “immature.” Dismissal kills trust. Both of you need to feel like the other person is a safe person to share even the scariest stuff with.  Don’t hide or conceal your feelings in an effort to “be strong.” Suppressing or concealing your feelings can lead to resentment and cause serious damage to your relationship.When your boyfriend is sharing with you, demonstrate that you’re listening and empathizing by saying things like “I appreciate your willingness to share this with me” or “I hear you saying that you feel afraid because ___”. These open and accepting types of remarks will encourage him to see you as someone he can trust., Passive-aggressive behavior is the opposite of clear, open communication, and it can kill a relationship in no time. It’s usually motivated by anger or hurt. It may be tempting to “punish” your boyfriend if he’s upset or hurt you, but it’s much healthier (and more effective) to just talk it out. There are many ways to be passive-aggressive in a relationship, but here are a few to watch out for:“Forgetting” to do something. One common way people show passive-aggression in relationships is to “forget” to do something they don’t want to do. You might “forget” to buy tickets to that movie you really don’t want to go see. He might “forget” your anniversary if you upset him. This kind of behavior hurts both of you.  Saying things you don’t mean. Sarcasm is a quick way to hurt other people. Sometimes, people engage in passive-aggressive language to indirectly communicate that they are displeased or upset. For example, if your boyfriend forgot that you had a date together Friday night and bought tickets to a hockey game instead, a passive-aggressive response might look like this: “No, why would I be upset? I love it when you forget things that are important to me. You should definitely go that hockey game.” Instead of communicating your feelings with respect and clarity, this type of language provokes defensiveness and even confusion (some people are just not great at picking up on sarcasm).  Giving the “silent treatment.” If you feel upset or hurt, you may ignore or pretend not to hear your boyfriend. This type of behavior is damaging because it can kill genuine efforts to open a conversation, and may eventually discourage conversation altogether. If you need time to cool off -- which is totally healthy and natural -- be open about it: “I am too upset to talk about this right now. Please give me an hour, and then we’ll talk.”  , We communicate more with our non-verbal communication -- our body language and gestures -- than we do with what we say. Keep an eye on your body language. It may be sending messages you didn’t mean.Keep your arms uncrossed and loose. Folding your arms across your chest makes you look defensive or closed off.  Make eye contact. Not making eye contact can tell the other person that you’re not interested or listening to what he’s saying. Try to make eye contact at least 50% of the time while speaking, and 70% of the time while listening.Avoid pointing. This can feel accusatory or intimidating. Try gesturing with an open palm instead.  Keep your body turned toward the other person when you’re interacted. Facing away or to the side of the other person indicates that you’re not engaged with what’s going on.  We live in a super-connected world, but ironically, this can actually cause you and your boyfriend to feel more distant from each other. You aren’t really communicating if you’re both on your phones or computers all the time. Commit to having some time for just the two of you: no phones, no computers, no video games.It’s really easy to pick up your phone without even realizing you’ve done it. If this is a problem for you, try putting your phone somewhere else, like a box by the door, when it’s your “no-tech time together.”  If you don’t live together, try talking on the phone or over Skype in addition to texting. A lot of communication involves non-verbal cues, like tone of voice, gestures, and facial expression. All of this is lost in texts.Try to chat for a least a few minutes as close to “in-person” as you can each day. This will help build a connection and make him want to continue that intimacy that you showed with him in the beginning.  Remember when you first started dating, how every date was something new? And you were so excited to see each other that you could barely wait until date night? If you’ve fallen into a “rut” in your relationship, varying up your routines together can make both of you feel more excited to spend time together.Try something new. Trying new things together, whether it’s a new restaurant or a new hobby, will help you bond over the experience. It will also expand your “toolbox” of fun stuff to enjoy together.  Switch up your current routines. For example, if you love movie nights, see what you can do to make them more fun. See if an old theater is playing your favorite movie on the big screen. Check out “screenings under the stars” in the summer. Go to a dinner theater or a sing-a-long movie. Make a themed dinner for your next movie night (“Goodfellas” and spaghetti, anyone?).  These don’t have to be huge. Even if it’s just working on homework at a coffee shop together, spending quality time together can help you feel more connected.  Relationships work best when both people maintain some separate interests and spend time on their own or with their own friends.Both of you need to have an identity that doesn’t revolve around the other person. No one likes to be constantly watched or hovered over.  This shows him that you trust him. If you let him know he's earned your trust, he's actually less likely to throw that trust away. If you don't trust him to be responsible on his own, he could be more likely to betray that trust just because he resents not being trusted.No matter how much you love each other, no one person can meet every single need the other person has. Spending time with other friends and having outside interests helps both of you stay happy, healthy, well-rounded people. It also makes the time you spend together extra-special.  Especially if your boyfriend enjoys getting gifts or surprises, making them really personal shows that you know him better than anyone else and you really pay attention to his needs and preferences. Think about the things your boyfriend would love to do/get, and use that as a guide.  Does your boyfriend like sports? Is he an adrenaline junky? Get the two of you a pair of tickets to a local football, basketball, or soccer game. Take him to an amusement park and ride as many roller coasters as you can in three hours.  Is your boyfriend the hopeless romantic type? In touch with his sensitive side? Get him an old Philip Larkin or John Keats book of poetry and inscribe something on the cover: 'With all my heart — the love that flows through these words is meant just for you.'  Is your boyfriend the outdoorsy type? Take him on a camping trip and snuggle up with him in his sleeping bag. Or maybe take him whale watching or bird-calling in your local Audubon Society.  If your boyfriend enjoys words of affirmation (remember those love languages?), try leaving him a little note. Whether it’s straightforward, humorous, or even outright wacky, these little reminders can show you care.Gauge your note to what makes your boyfriend feel most comfortable. If he’s a little squeamish about gushy feelings, write him a playfully funny note. If he loves sincere expressions of feeling, tell him how much he means to you.  Humans quickly get used to even positive things in their lives. This is called “hedonic adaptation.” Make sure you don’t leave so many notes that they stop being meaningful. Too much of a good thing really is still too much., Displays of affection are especially important if your boyfriend values “Physical Touch” as a love language. Don’t do anything that embarrasses him, but let him know you think he’s adorable.  Check out what your boyfriend likes. He may love it when you nibble on his neck, or he may hate it. Knowing what makes him feel loved and what turns him on will help you display your affection in healthy ways.  Dressing in “sexy” clothes for your boyfriend can add a little spice to your relationship. Find out if he has a fantasy or something he finds hot and do something special every now and then. He will be more than happy to return the favor.  Remember that there are other ways to show physical affection than sex. Try holding hands, hugging, kissing, and cuddling, too. It’s good to have a variety of ways to show your affection for each other.  Don’t take it personally if your boyfriend isn’t into the same physical displays of affection that you are. People are different., It’s important for the two of you to have separate interests and your own friends, but it can also strengthen your relationship to spend time with each other’s friends, too.A common problem in new relationships is that you start spending more time with your new boyfriend and less time with your friends. This can cause your friends to feel neglected, and it can also put strain on your relationship. Integrate your boyfriend into your social circle by inviting him out once in a while. Go out with his friends once in a while, too.  Have a quiet dinner, for example, and let your boyfriend know how much he means to you. Let him share some of his opinions and his feelings. Really listen to what he has to say, but offer comments to make the conversation flow. Clear some things up if you need to.  Go on dates that you think he would appreciate. Think of activities where you both can be close together such as: a boat ride, a nature hike, a trip to the zoo, a train trip, a day trip to a nearby town, etc.  Take a day off. Do something totally unexpected, like making music together and recording it. Take advantage of your new found freedom, even if it's just a day, and live like you've got one day to love.Making memories together will give you something to reminisce about later. Research shows that remembering fun experiences you had together later will help you feel more bonded to each other., According to psychologist Gary Chapman, people have “love languages” that they use to show love themselves and interpret demonstrations of love from other people. Knowing each other’s love languages allows you to show your love in the way that the other person will most strongly connect with. If you and your boyfriend have different love languages and don’t know it, it can cause a lot of stress. The five love languages, according to Chapman, are “Words of Affirmation,” “Acts of Service,” “Receiving Gifts,” “Quality Time,” and “Physical Touch.”“Words of Affirmation” are things like compliments, encouragement, or “check-ins” about your feelings.  “Acts of Service” are things like doing chores or everyday stuff that the other person may not enjoy doing.  “Receiving Gifts” are things like gifts or visible symbols of love, like flowers.  “Quality Time” is time with your partner without interruptions or distractions.  “Physical Touch” can be any demonstration of physical affection, including hugging, kissing, or sex.  The key to these languages is sharing them with each other. That way, if your boyfriend prefers “Physical Touch” to “Receiving Gifts,” you’ll know how to show him you love him in a way he connects with. Similarly, if your boyfriend knows “Receiving Gifts” is your top language, he won’t be confused when you don’t naturally see his taking out the trash regularly as a sign of love.  It’s also important to keep these in mind so that you can be on the lookout for love signals that you might not otherwise pick up on.  These three components make up Robert Sternberg's theory of love. Although psychologists have varying opinions, in general, romantic “love” is the drive you feel toward feeling intimacy and commitment with a particular person. Passion, or lust, is sexual desire, which may or may not be limited to one person. In relationships, lust is often the instigating feeling: when you find someone hot, you become interested in pursuing him/her. Love requires time to develop and thrive.In relationships, it’s natural for both of these feelings to have ups and downs. In the beginning of a relationship -- often called the “honeymoon phase” -- it’s very common for lust to be at a peak: both of you can’t keep your hands off each other and you’re obsessed with how sexy the other person is.This is great, but it’s also natural for this phase to fade as you spend more time together and get to know each other more deeply.After the initial burst of lust fades, you may find that you’ve been idealizing your boyfriend thanks to chemicals in your brain going a little crazy.When that pedestal comes crashing down, you’ll start noticing things that annoy you, like how he flosses in front of you or checks out his groceries at the store differently than you do. This is normal. It’s where the “love” comes in. Love gives you the patience to ignore the little annoyances because you really dig this guy.  This doesn’t mean lust has to disappear once you’ve been dating a few months. Take some time to explore what turns both of you on. Communicate your sexual needs to each other. Spice up your routines. Have fun with each other!  , “Men are from Mars, women are from Venus” is a common truism, but the truth is actually more complicated. Even people of the same gender can have very different communication styles. Whether you’re gay or straight, if it feels like you and your boyfriend are sometimes speaking different languages, it could be because your communication styles aren’t the same. There’s nothing inherently “better” about one way or the other, but it’s helpful to understand how both of you communicate.Some people are affiliative communicators. Affiliative communicators enjoy asking others for feedback. They tend to prefer collaboration, and may see challenges or disagreement as signs of aggression or hostility. If you prefer to listen to all sides, avoid conflict, approach issues collaboratively, and speak up less rarely, you may be an affiliative communicator.  Some people are competitive communicators. Competitive communicators tend to be direct, assertive, and okay with presenting challenges. They like to gather information and make their own decisions. They often prefer to be in charge. If you speak your mind readily, feel comfortable with conflict, and prefer to make decisions on your own, you may be a competitive communicator.  People can also vary in terms of their directness. Some people are comfortable with direct communication, such as “I want to spend more time together.” Others are more comfortable with indirect communication, such as “It’s fun when we spend time together. It’s too bad we don’t do it more.” Either form can be appropriate, depending on the situation. The important thing is to listen to each other and clarify when you don’t understand.  Having different communication styles doesn’t mean your relationship is doomed. It just means you need to know what differences can cause tension between you, and both of you need to commit to flexibility and compromise.

"More creative children may want to draw pictures, others may want stickers or to write in colourful pens. This is their journal, so let them pick what they want and let creativity reign. Materials you may need are: Pens, pencils, a notebook/paper, glue stick (for pictures, menus etc), coloured pencils, stickers/other design products.  Children don't need leather bound books for their journals. A simple notebook or pages you design should work perfectly. If you choose to go the paper route, make sure to bring a folder for the pages so you can keep them all together and they don't get bent.  For on the go without a big bag, get a small notebook for bullet points of things you want to remember and a pen. This way you'll never forget anything and be able to fill it in all later without the hassle of pulling out a big notebook and taking time to write it out.;  , Later they can decide if they want to write about it all or only certain points. It's also important to remind your child about the journal as they may get excited and forget, even if they regret it later. Have a scheduled time for your child to do the journal each night. It will become a routine and you will not get it piled up. It will also be fresh in the mind so they'll remember more details.  The entries don't have to be long if your child doesn't want them to be. Recording feelings/weather etc is also fun to add for later on. It doesn't have to be anything fancy.

"Let's say you're working with the equation 2/x = 10/13. Now, multiply 2 * 13. 2 * 13 = 26.;  , Now multiply x by 10. x * 10 = 10x. You can cross multiply in this direction first; it really doesn't matter as long as you multiply both numerators by the denominators diagonal from them.  Just set 26 equal to 10x. 26 = 10x. It doesn't matter which number you list first; since they're equal, you can swap them from one side of the equation to the other with impunity, as long as you treat each term as a whole.  So, if you're trying to solve 2/x = 10/13 for x, you'd have 2 * 13 = x * 10, or 26 = 10x.  Now that you're working with 26 = 10x, you can start by finding a common denominator and dividing both 26 and 10 by a number that divides evenly into both numbers. Since they are both even, you can divide them by 2; 26/2 = 13 and 10/2 = 5. You're left with 13 = 5x. Now, to isolate x, divide both sides of the equation by 5. So, 13/5 = 5/5, or 13/5 = x. If you'd like the answer in decimal form, you can start by dividing both sides of the equation by 10 to get 26/10 = 10/10, or 2.6 = x.

"Once you have received permission from the school and school board, you will need to finalize the reservation with the site. You will also need to be in touch with them again once you have final numbers after receiving all student permission forms.  Schools usually have different systems for organizing buses and transportation for field trips. You will either use an outside contractor or the regular school board buses. If you are using buses through the school board you will need to make sure that the field trip does not interfere with the bus driver’s regular scheduled route.Regardless of the type of bus you use, you will need to clearly communicate to the driver the proper addresses and times for pickup and drop off.  You should also introduce yourself as the class leader on the day of the trip and thank the bus driver for their work.  Most field trip venues will allow teachers to visit the site in advance free of charge. This will allow you to familiarize yourself with the site and scheduled activities, meet the staff, and learn where the washrooms are located. You may also want to take pictures of some of the exhibits to show to your students prior the field trip.Explore some of the exhibits and activities that your class will be visiting in order to come up with ideas for pre-trip class room activities.  Depending on the size of your class and the requirements of the venue you may need to ask for volunteer chaperones. Parents or family members of your students make great chaperones. You may also be able to ask a colleague or administrator at the school to help out with chaperoning duties.Once you have acquired enough adult chaperones, you should provide them with any behavioural guidelines and a detailed schedule for the trip.  Do not assume that adults will intuitively know what is expected of them.  Throughout the planning process you have likely accumulated a large amount of paperwork that you may need to access on the day of the trip. Compile the following forms and information into a single binder or store it electronically on your tablet or cellphone:Signed permission forms.  Student medical and insurance information.  Parent/guardian emergency contact information for that day.  Extra money in case of an emergency.  Checklist of all students and chaperones in attendance.  List of students who must take medication during the trip.  You will need to have a clear idea of exactly who is attending the field trip and you will also need to communicate this information to the following people:  The school office: Provide a list all of the children attending the trip, the children absent that day, the children who will remain at the school and their location, and a cell phone number where you can be reached.  Chaperones: Provide a comprehensive class list, a list of each subgroup, and the name of the supervisor for each group.  Teachers: Provide a master list of all the groups, all the buddy partnerships, the parent contact information, the student health and insurance information, and the school phone number.

Make sure that you provide these students with fun activities to engage in while they remain at school. If possible try and provide them with a similar experience.  For example, you could have them complete an online scavenger hunt by researching a similar topic to that being covered on the class trip.

"Windshield wipers are made with three basic parts: the lower wiper arm that extends from the base of the windshield, the metal or plastic blade attached to the lower arm, and the rubber blade that actually wipes the windshield. When your windshield wiper blades are changed, you're really only changing the rubber blades that get worn down by water and inclement weather.;  , To find out what size replacement blades you need, measure the old rubber blades using a ruler or measuring tape. Write down the exact measurements, then go to an auto parts store and buy rubber blades in those exact sizes.  Don't assume that the left and right wiper take the same size blade. One side is often an inch or two shorter than the other.  Wiper blades usually run about $15.00 a piece. You'll save the cost of labor by installing them yourself.  It should be able to hold steady in a position perpendicular to the windshield. Be careful with the positioning; the metal wiper arm is spring-loaded, and it could snap back and crack your windshield.  Look at the joint where the rubber wiper blade meets the metal arm. There should be a small plastic stopper holding the blade in place. Press the stopper and unhook the old wiper blade to separate it from the metal arm.  Some wiper blades have pins to hold the rubber wiper blade in place, rather than a hook.  Make sure one hand is holding the wiper away from the windshield during this entire process.  You may want to protect your windshield with a folded towel, just in case you the arm snaps back while you're trying to change the wiper.  Slide the refill wiper into the same end of the arm where you pulled the old wiper out. Gently pivot the new wiper until the hook snaps into place to secure it. Lay the wiper back against the windshield.  The procedure is exactly the same for replacing the second wiper. Just make sure you use the correct size for each side.  Old windshield wipers become hard and cracked over time, especially in hot, dry climates. If your wiper seems to have lost it's rubbery spring, it's probably time to replace it.  If your wipers leave streaks of water across your windshield that aren't much easier to see through than pounding rain, their rubber has probably lost its grip.  ","know what part of the blade to change. measure the size blade you need and buy replacement blades. raise the metal wiper arm away from the windshield. unhook the old wiper blade. insert the new wiper. repeat with the second wiper. examine the wipers for cracks. pay attention next time it rains.

Now you will see a list of options from where you need to select your objective. Select 'Send people to your website'. Enter the URL, which will be the landing page of your website. In case your goal is to achieve an email lead, enter the page where it asks the prospective customer to enter an email.  Now you will come to a section asking you 'Who do you want your adverts to reach?' Here you can define the filters and qualification criteria of the audience you wish to target:  Custom audiences - If you have a custom list of emails or phone numbers for people whom you want to target through Facebook advertising, add them here. You can upload this list through a simple Excel file. Note that this will work only if the target audience has used these emails/phone numbers to create their Facebook account.  Location - Select your country, state or town.  Age - Select the age range.  Gender - Select any of all, men, women.  Languages - You can use language targeting as well. In case the prospective customer has entered that language in his or her Facebook profile settings, the potential customer can see your ad. Note that not all languages are available. In most cases, it is recommended that you select English (All).  More Demographics - This is where you can select relationship status, educational level, work status, whether a parent or not, etc. Multiple choices are possible here.  Interests - Select as required or leave blank.  Behaviors - Select as required or leave blank.

Thus, you will not waste your advertising on those who have already liked your page.  This should give you an idea about the approximate possible audience of your Facebook ad and you can adjust the filters and targeting mentioned above to arrive at an optimal reach.  For example, 250 per day, and enter a schedule with a start and end date. Make sure you select the correct month as well. If you want your ads to begin immediately, you can also select 'Run my ad continuously starting today'. Once approved, the ad will start and be live. You may pause it later or schedule an end date later if you want.  This is what is recommended for general use. Or, you can look at the other options of paying for impressions or setting a maximum bid per click.  Use Advert set name, by which you can name your set as something that represents the ads. For example, Company_Location_Clicks.  The recommended size is 1200 X 628 pixels. You can upload up to six images and these will create six Facebook ads. These ads will come under the same advert set. Thus, the budget of 250 per day will be spent over all of these ads. If you selected 'Optimize for Clicks', the ad that initially generates more clicks is likely to take precedence.  Now you come to the section - 'What text and links do you want to use?' Firstly, connect your Facebook page if you have it. Clicking on your ad will take the user to your website but it will show as coming from your Facebook page.  Put in the headline and text of your ad. Select the call to action button. For example, you can use 'Learn more'.

Now in the 'Advert preview and placements' section on the right, select where you would like the ad to show. For a clicks to website campaign, the news feed placement will be more productive. Therefore, it is recommended that you generally use only that. If this was an 'Increase likes to your page' campaign, you could Select All, since the like page option appears on the Facebook ad itself and it's easy to like the page on mobiles as well.

"Studies on people have shown that beans and other legumes can prevent heart disease, diabetes, and cancer, so eat legumes such as:  Black beans  Lentils-- red and yellow  Chickpeas  Mung beans;  , Complex carbohydrates found in whole grains, starchy vegetables and legumes are the best sources of complex carbohydrates. Top healthy choices include:  Steel-cut oats  Wheat-- whole or cracked  Bulgar  Barley  Quinoa  Rice-- brown and wild  Popcorn  Squash and pumpkin  Sweet potatoes  Potato wedges-- grilled or baked  Soybeans  Split peas  Beans-- white, kidney and chili  , Yes, fats. The healthy fats are typically found in plants and are classified chemically as monounsaturated or polyunsaturated fats. Bad fats are made by chemical reactions that create products with long shelf lives. The food industry benefits when their products last a long time. The problem is that if bacteria, oxygen and micro-organisms can't break the so-called foods down, our enzymes cannot either. These fats become a poison to our bodies, work our bodies excessively and clog up our internal systems. These fats, which have no analogs in nature, are classified as saturated or trans-fats.  Good fats are found in:  Avocados  Nuts-- almonds, macadamia nuts, hazelnuts, pecans, cashews  Natural monounsaturated oils-- olive, canola, sunflower, peanut, sesame  Natural polyunsaturated oils-- soybean, corn, safflower  Olives  Almond butter  Seeds-- sunflower, sesame, pumpkin, flax  Fatty fish-- wild salmon, tuna, mackerel, herring, trout, sardines  Soy milk  Tofu  The sources of bad fats are:  Tropical plants and oils  Synthetic saturated or trans-fats  Fats found in animals  Limit intake of fats from the bad sources.  Milk, often thought to be a good source of calcium, is actually a very bad source of calcium. The 'hype' that milk is good for you is a product of lobbying by the dairy producers. The reality is that people who drink milk often don't get enough calcium. So, as it turns out, it is good to stay away from dairy.  Protein is necessary for proper metabolism and optimal health. The thing is, protein is good for you, if you don't consume to much of it. Also, people often eat lots of animal protein, which is the worst source of protein. Protein from beans and nuts are a much, much better. The verdict is still out on how much protein is enough, so, for now, just eat some beans four or more times a week, and include nuts as well.  You know this already. It's not so bad, though, once you've learned how to eat them. And you don't have to be a gourmet chef to prepare them, either. Search online for quick and easy ways to prepare vegetables.  If you love your desserts, you're not alone. But, your body cannot handle sugary cakes, pies and cookies every day, so opt for the healthy fruit alternative when it is available and in season.  Fruit is important because it is packed with vitamins and minerals. Again, search online to find quick and easy ideas for turning fresh fruit into a favorite dessert!  , If you're working a lot, you probably don't have time for exercise. If you're constantly on your feet at work, your muscles might not need much additional exercise. But, for a healthy heart, make time for a walk in the morning before you go to work or in the evening after dinner. If you get breaks in your work schedule use that time to benefit your body.

"The main appeal of peanut butter powder is its low calorie count. A tablespoon of powdered peanut butter has about 25 calories compared to the 96 calories in the same amount of regular peanut butter. It is a good option for those looking to lose some weight but still enjoy peanut flavor., Another appealing feature of powdered peanut butter is its low fat content. 1 tablespoon contains less than 1 gram (0.035 oz) of fat, while the same amount of regular peanut butter has about 8 grams (0.3 oz) of fat. Note that the fat content of peanuts is mostly heart-healthy monounsaturated fats.A single serving of peanut butter powder is 2 tablespoons. One serving contains about 1.5 grams of fat.  Powdered peanut butter is great for adding protein and fiber nutrients without adding the extra fat — 1 tablespoon offers 3 to 4 grams (0.11 to 0.14 oz) of protein and 1 gram (0.035 oz) of fiber. This is particularly important for things like baking where the extra fat can alter the finished product.  ","reduce your caloric intake. limit your fat intake. add a little protein or fiber. "
"As your skin cells die (a very normal, fairly fast process) you should be able to easily scrub and wash off any remaining ink. This should not take more than a few days. In other words, the ink should come off more or less on its own.  If any remaining ink needs to be covered up (for example, your frat buddies wrote racist slurs all over your face and you have an internship interview the next day), try makeup. You’ll need foundation and powder in your skin tone. You can also use Dermablend Cover Crème, which is well known for being able to cover just about anything and is frequently used to cover tattoos.  You may need someone a little more experienced to help you apply it if you don’t know how because it is harder than it sounds, but you should be able to cover up any remaining ink with makeup.  The idea that you can get ink poisoning from getting ink on your skin is false.Ink poisoning can only result from orally ingesting ink, and then only a great deal of it. Again, don’t panic. If you are very concerned, you can call your local poison hotline.  ","don’t panic if you cannot remove all of it. try makeup. know that you will not get ink poisoning. "
"Reading a long book can be a challenge if you have no interest in the book’s subject. To make reading a long book more fun, try to relate it to something that is familiar to you or at least try to understand the context of the book to make it more familiar.  For example, if the book is about a love triangle between three fictional characters, try to relate their situation to something that happened to a friend of yours or to the plot of a movie you like.  Or, if you are reading a book that was written over 100 years ago, do a little research about the author, the year the book was written, and the place where the author lived. This may help to make the book seem more approachable.;  , Pretend that you will have to teach someone what you are about to read and then read with that in mind. Consider how you would describe a character, event, or concept to someone who has not read the book. This will prompt your brain to remember the material and make it easier for you write or answer questions about the material later on., If you are reading the book for a class, then you might have a paper or test that will require you to draw on what you have read. Identify the questions that you might have to answer before you start reading. This will make it easier to stay focused and avoid getting overwhelmed by other information., Using visualization can also make reading more fun and help you to remember important information. As you read, pause now and then to imagine what the characters in the book look like, what the setting looks like, or how an important scene might have looked.  You can also use this strategy to help you remember important dates, names, and other facts as you read. For example, if the book you are reading describes an important battle, take a moment to imagine the scene. Imagine that the date of the battle and other important information about it are stamped onto the image.  ","relate what you read to what you know. get into a teacher’s mindset. identify questions that you want to answer. visualize what you read. "

"This usually consists of 2 x 4-foot (5.1 x 10.2 cm) framework attached to the basement concrete wall with screws.  Install insulation board onto the concrete or cinder block wall prior to installing the framework using construction adhesive applied with a caulk gun. This will form a vapor barrier between the walls and the sheetrock.  The studs, or furring, will have a top and bottom plate with the studs on 16-inch (40.6 cm) centers. Plumb the framework by using shims, or wedges, between the face of the basement wall and your framework.  Begin framing from one corner and work around the basement back to your starting point.;  , This would also include any cable TV, internet or phone lines.  It is best to start at one corner with the sheets lying horizontally along the bottom.  Use wedges, or shims, to raise the sheetrock off the floor and keep the bottom row of sheetrock level to the top edge.  Most likely your basement will not be a standard height, and you will need to custom cut the sheet. Make sure it fits above the first row by measuring from the top of the first row to the top plate.  Score it with a utility knife along the marks you make. Begin breaking the sheetrock from one edge and move toward the other edge.  The rock should break evenly if you scored deep enough. If it didn't, next time try to cut or score the sheetrock deeper.  It is best to tape the walls using 3-inch (7.6 cm) fiberglass tape rather than a paper tape in a basement location. Fiberglass tape resists cracking and moisture better in areas where you might have a lot of movement or moisture. The fiberglass attaches directly over the joints and embedment applied over them.  This gives the walls a nice smooth appearance and makes it ready to finish with texture and paint.

"Start flirting with the person by teasing, playfully touching, or just paying attention to him or her. Let the person know you're interested and give him or her a few not-so-subtle compliments. You're not trying to be coy here -- you're looking for a hook-up buddy.  Once the person is interested, you can start kissing or doing something more. Tell the person how attracted you are to him or her but do not compliment that person's personality or say anything that makes it sound like you want to date.  Every non-couple is different. Some friends with benefits know each other well enough to set some ground rules before they start hooking up. But that can feel a little awkward and unnatural, so you may want to wait until after that first kiss or hook-up session. Ideally, you should have the talk before sex, so you know that both people are on the same page and that no one gets really hurt. Here are the things you should talk about:  Make it clear that you are not dating -- you're just having fun. Both of you should be free to hook up with other people.  Make sure that you won't see each other too often. You should see each other just two or three times a week, preferably at night. If you see each other almost every day, then guess what? That's dating.  Decide that you'll end the relationship when one person gets too attached. Unless you both start falling for each other, make it clear that if someone gets attached, it's over.  That's what having friends with benefits is for, isn't it? Have fun hooking up with your 'friend,' letting loose, and trying the things you were too afraid to try with your old boyfriend or girlfriend. This is your time to let loose and experiment, picking up the tricks you can use to wow future partners. Have fun trying new poses, having sex in kinky locations, and just throwing caution to the wind.  As you ease in to your friends with benefits relationship, don't forget to check in with the person you're hooking up with. Make sure you're both into each other, but not too much. If you'll both be at a party, talk about how you'll act. If you're also hooking up with another person, don't be shady about it. You don't have to spill your heart out, but you should keep talking so you know what's working and what isn't.

"If the person is telling you what to wear, what to eat, where you can go, and who you can see, this is a controlling behavior and a sign of emotional abuse.The abuser makes you feel dependent on him and that you are unable to make your own decisions.

"When speaking in class, it can help to have an idea of what to say going into a discussion. You may feel less nervous participating in a discussion if you have a thorough knowledge of your subject matter.Do your homework. If you know there's a debate or discussion coming up in class, preparing ahead of time can help. You'll be more at ease participating in class if you know what you're talking about, so do the reading and homework before coming to class.  Plan what to say before raising your hand. Think of a short sentence, or at least a couple of key points, before you volunteer to speak. It may help to jot down some of your ideas on a piece of paper before raising your hand to give an answer.;  , It can help to relax before speaking. This can make you feel more at ease, allowing yourself to speak with more confidence. Relaxing can also loosen your vocal cords, allowing you to talk in a loud, cohesive manner.Take a few deep breaths before speaking. Try to breathe in a way that draws breath down into your stomach. Inhale and exhale deeply before raising your hand, as this will allow you to speak louder.  Make an effort to relax your body before speaking. Relax your shoulders and neck, as tense muscles in these places will make it difficult to project your voice.  Stand up with a straight back. Hold your head so your ears are in line with your shoulders. Keep your chin relaxed and avoid the temptation to jut it forward when you speak. Much like relaxing your body, maintaining proper posture boosts confidence. It also promotes air flow, allowing you to speak clearly., If you're not used to being vocal in class, you may be tempted to yell to make sure you are heard. Yelling strains the voice and makes you sound aggressive. It can cause tension in your neck and throat. Do not yell out the answer. Speak loudly, without raising your voice to the point you can feel stress in your body., Make a conscious effort to speak slow during class discussions. Talking too fast makes you come off as a nervous. Try to speak slowly, pronouncing your words one at a time. This will allow you to get your words out in an understandable manner.It may feel awkward at first. Many people, when nervous, speak fast.  If you're giving a longer answer, pause between paragraphs. This will help listeners absorb your words., If you want to be the loud kid, avoid using an affected or false voice when speaking in class. Speaking in a voice that is not your own can strain the vocal cords. If you're working to be the loud kid in class each day, you do not want to put stress on your voice. This will get tiring fast. Speak in your own voice clearly and distinctly., Oftentimes, people are hesitant to be wrong as they fear their own faults. Keep in mind everyone gives a wrong answer on occasion. If you want to be loud in class, and abandon any fears of public speaking, you have to risk being wrong. Remind yourself all your classmates have given wrong answers on occasion, and that the teacher will appreciate you trying even if you're not right every time., Another step to becoming the loud kid in class is working on being more outgoing. In addition to speaking in class, you'll want to branch out and talk to other classmates during downtime. If you're shy by nature, or otherwise nervous, becoming outgoing can be a challenge. Go slowly. It can take awhile to get used to putting yourself out there and socializing.Take small steps forward. Smile at a classmate in the hallway. Say 'Hi' to a classmate at lunch.  As you progress, try not to back down. You may be tempted, for example, to turn away at the last minute when approaching a new table during lunch. Resist this urge. Succumbing to shyness will only reinforce it, so try to follow through.  As with any behavior, being outgoing takes practice. If you practice engaging in social behaviors, like small talk during class, they'll get easier.Try practicing with your existing friends. You guys can role play scenarios in which you make small talk with kids from your school. You can also work on talking before the mirror. It may feel silly, but you may gain confidence by having mock conversations with yourself.  Practice in real life. Outside of school, chat with the cashier at a local coffee shop. If your parents have friends over, say 'Hi' and ask them how their day is. The more you practice social behaviors outside of school, the more comfortable you'll feel being loud in the classroom.  If you want to be more outgoing in class, it may help to join some extracurriculars. Pick activities that interest you and attend meetings. You may feel like you can be yourself when socializing with those with shared interests. If you meet people in after school clubs, you'll have a social network in your classroom. This can allow you to feel comfortable talking to others, allowing you to be loud in class.It may take some practice before you feel comfortable talking during extracurricular activities. However, it's important to give yourself a chance. Think of conversation starters before a meeting. For example, write down questions like, 'What's your favorite subject in school?'  Once you've formed a group from extracurriculars, you'll have someone to talk to during class. You can talk, joke, and be loud together during downtime at school.  Self criticism often prevents people from putting themselves out there and becoming outgoing. Try to remind yourself it's okay to feel nervous or awkward at times. Everyone is insecure, and it's inevitable you'll sometimes feel nervous when trying to become louder and more assertive in school.A good way to curb self criticism is to imagine a friend or loved one criticizing themselves the way you criticize yourself. Try to imagine how you would talk a friend out of nervousness or shyness. Then take your own advice.  If you're less insecure, and more accepting of the fact you'll sometimes feel awkward or out of place, you're far more likely to relax and socialize more. This can result in you feeling more comfortable being a loud student in class.  While you may want to be seen as the loud one, you don't want to talk out of turn. Talking without raising your hand can get you in trouble with your teacher. Also, other students may get irritated if you're constantly interrupting. Wait until other students finish their sentences. Only talk when your teacher calls on you, and always raise your hand first.  It's not always a good idea to talk during class. Avoid talking during moments where you may get in trouble for being loud. Do not talk during class lectures or during student presentations. Avoid the temptation to whisper to your friends. While it can be fun to be the loud one in class, you do not want the role to land you in detention.  If you're a louder person by nature, people may not always want to listen. Make sure to stay in tune to social cues so you can catch when you're talking too much.Watch body language. People may break eye contact. They may fiddle with something or seem otherwise distracted.  Also, pay attention to what the listener is saying. If they're responding with only 'Okays' and 'uh-huhs,' you're probably talking to much. You should allow the other person to speak.  You want to make sure you listen as much as you talk. Being loud can get annoying if you dominate the conversation. When other people speak, genuinely listen to what they say. Do not simply plan your own response ahead of time. Also, encourage conversation. Ask people open ended questions, like, 'What's your opinion on this subject?' and 'What do you think about this topic?' If you provoke conversation and discussion, this can help solidify your reputation as a loud student without people thinking of you as dominating or difficult.  ","think of what to say ahead of time. relax. maintain proper posture. avoid yelling. speak slowly. use your natural voice. do not worry about being wrong. start small. practice social behaviors. join an extracurricular activity. accept you'll sometimes feel awkward. take your turn. talk only when appropriate. pay attention to social cues. listen as much as you talk.

"Serrated knives need different sharpeners than straight-edged blades. Most serrated knife sharpeners are rod-shaped, usually with a taper to accommodate different sized serrations.;  , Serrated knives generally do not look the same from both sides. On one side, the face of the blade will continue at the same angle until the blade's edge. On the other, the face of the blade will angle down slightly just before the serrated edge; this is called the bevel. Only apply a sharpening tool to the beveled edge.  Choosing an angle is easier for serrated blades, because you can use the angle of the bevel as a guide. This is typically between 13 and 17 degrees compared to the edge of the blade, which is shallower than you may be used to sharpening knives.If the knife also has a straight edge portion, the bevels are usually ground to the same angle — about 20 to 25 degrees.If you want a better guide, draw on the gullets with permanent marker. You'll know you're hitting them at the right angle if the marker is removed., If your sharpening rod is tapered, locate the rod in the gullet at the point where the rod's diameter is the same size as the gullet's, or slightly smaller.  Run the sharpening rod along the first groove in several short strokes. Push in one direction away from the edge of the blade, toward the spine. Rotate the rod as you push it for a more even grind.Push only to the point of the rod with the same diameter as the gullet, to avoid enlarging the gullet.  Run your fingers along the backside of the groove to check for a 'burr,' or metal shavings. As soon as you can feel a burr, you have sharpened the groove sufficiently. This often only takes a few strokes.  Try running your fingernail along the back edge. If you feel it catch, there's a burr., If the knife's serrations are different sizes, adjust the position of the tapered sharpening rod so that the rod just fills the groove.  The burrs are the metal shavings that you filed off when sharpening the blade. To remove them, rub the back of the knife against a sheet of fine-grit sandpaper. As an alternative, you could lightly run the sharpening rod against the backside of each groove, being careful not to apply more pressure than necessary to remove the shavings.  If your knife is only serrated along a part of the blade's length, sharpen the remaining length with a whetstone or other sharpening tool. Don't attempt to use the serrated knife sharpener on the straight portion of the blade.  ","purchase a serrated knife sharpening tool. locate the side of your knife with a beveled edge. place the sharpening rod in one of the serrated scallops ('gullets'). move the rod to match the gullet's diameter. sharpen the first gullet. check for a burr. continue sharpening each groove on the blade. file away all the burrs. sharpen any straight-edged portion of the blade.

"This will help you to know what is needed and the direction you want the room to take.;  , Having accents in your room will create the needed contrast and focal points. Black is a nice, stark contrast, which would make an even more elegant room, but you can use any colour you like the most.  If you have a dark room, you will need to layer many coats. Use long, even strokes in all one direction, and don't touch the paint while it's drying.  An antique or canopy bed in white would suit the theme nicely.  Get suitable bedspreads as well. You could use white or your chosen accent colour.  Again, an antique wood side table in white would suit the theme quite nicely.  All furniture should be white or whitish, preferably antiques. You can paint wood white if needed.  This should be white.  You can put your books, DVDs, and CDs on them.  This does not have to be antique, but crystal or 'fristal' (fake crystal) would work very well.  Choose a deep pile one that you can sink your feet into it when you get up in the morning. Try a rug in your accent colour.  Have it in white. Place it beside your bed.  They should be simple black velvet curtains held up by an accent colour ribbon.  You could add a wall mirror, a wastebasket, etc.  Put them in black or silver frames.  Again, hang these in black and silver frames.

"Add 1 cup (230 g) of unsalted butter that’s been softened to room temperature to the bowl of a stand mixer with the paddle attachment in place. Turn the mixer on medium, and beat the butter until it is smooth, which should take approximately 30 seconds to 1 minute.If you don’t have a stand mixer, you can mix the cookie dough with a handheld electric mixer. You can also mix the dough by hand, but it will be a little more time and labor intensive.;  , Once the butter is smooth, mix in ⅔ cup (83 g) of confectioners’ sugar that’s been sifted. Beat the mixture again until it has a silky, smooth texture, which should take approximately 30 seconds.Using confectioners’ sugar instead of granulated sugar helps give the dough a smoother texture.  When the sugar is blended with the butter, add 2 large egg yolks that are at room temperature, a pinch of salt, and 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of vanilla extract. Beat the mixture until all of the ingredients are thoroughly combined.You can substitute almond extract for the vanilla if you prefer.  If you want to add dried fruits, such as raisins or cranberries, or whole nuts, such as walnuts or pecans, to the cookies, mix them in with the eggs, vanilla, and salt.  When the eggs, vanilla, and salt are incorporated, turn the mixer’s speed down to low and slowly add the flour. Blend the mixture until the flour is just incorporated.Be careful not to overmix the flour into the dough. You’re better off under mixing with the stand mixer and using a spatula to fold in any flour that hasn’t been incorporated.  To make chocolate slice-and-bake cookies, substitute ¼ cup (30 g) of unsweetened cocoa for ¼ cup (35 g) of flour in the base dough recipe. Mix the dough as normal.For even more chocolatey flavor, mix in ½ cup (90 g) of mini chocolate chips after the dough has come together.  If you prefer a nutty flavor, replace ½ to 1 cup (70 to 140 g) of the flour with the same amount of ground nuts and mix the dough as normal. Walnuts, pecans, almonds, and hazelnuts are all delicious options.You can bump up the flavor of the cookies by mixing chopped nuts into the dough. Add them with the egg yolks, vanilla, and salt.  Give your cookies a tart flavor by adding ½ cup (60 g) of finely chopped dried cranberries and the zest from 2 oranges to to the dough with the egg yolks, vanilla, and salt. Add the flour as directed above.You can substitute lime or lemon zest for the orange if you prefer.  Add a spicy flavor to the cookies by mixing in 2 teaspoons (5 g) of cinnamon with the flour. Blend the flour and cinnamon into the dough as normal.After you’ve formed the dough into logs and are getting ready to slice them, roll it through a plate of cinnamon sugar to coat the outside of the cookies.  For a simple twist on basic slice-and-bake cookies, add ½ cup (90 g) of mini peanut butter or chocolate chips after you’ve mixed in the flour. Fold the chips in with a spatula until they’re fully incorporated.You can try other types of chips as well. Toffee, butterscotch, pumpkin spice, and other flavored chips can make the cookies even tastier.  When all of the ingredients are mixed, dump the dough out on a counter or cutting board. Use your hands to form a ball, and divide it into two equal parts.If you find that the dough is sticking to the counter or work surface, lightly dust the area with flour.  Once the dough is divided into two balls, wrap each one in plastic wrap. Place them in the refrigerator, and allow them to chill for 30 minutes., After the dough has chilled, remove it from the fridge. Place it on a flat work surface and carefully roll each piece into a log that is approximately 1 to 1 ¼ inches (2.5 to 3.2 cm) thick.You don’t need to pay much attention to the length of the logs. As long as they’re the right width, you’ll wind up with proper cookies.  When you’ve shaped the dough into logs, wrap each one in plastic wrap. Return them to the refrigerator, and allow them to chill for 2 hours.If the dough is wrapped up airtight, you can keep it in the refrigerator for up to 3 days or 3 months in the freezer.  After the dough has chilled for a couple of hours, remove it from the refrigerator. Unwrap the dough, and roll the logs through a coating of your choice if desired. Granulated sugar, cinnamon sugar, and chopped nuts are all tasty options.For holidays and special occasions, try rolling the dough in colored sugar or sprinkles to give the cookies a more festive look.  When you’re ready to bake the cookies, set the oven temperature to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degrees Celsius) and allow it to fully preheat. Next, line two cookie sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats to keep the cookies from sticking to them.If you don’t have parchment paper or silicone mats, you can grease the cookie sheets with nonstick cooking spray or butter.  To create the cookies, use a sharp knife to slice the dough into ¼-inch (6.3-mm) thick discs. Turn the logs a quarter turn after each slice to help keep the cookies round.If the dough gets soft as you’re slicing, place it back in the refrigerator to firm up. It will cut more easily if it’s cold.  Once you’ve sliced all of the dough, place the cookies on the lined cookie sheets. Make sure to space them ½ inch (1.5 cm) apart because they will spread during baking.If you would like to add granulated sugar, chopped nuts, sprinkles, or other toppings to cookies, sprinkle them over the dough before the cookies bake.  Place the cookies in the oven, and allow them to bake until they are set without browning. It should take approximately 12 to 14 minutes.For softer cookies, bake them for 12 minutes.  For crisper cookies, bake them for 14 minutes.  Once the cookies have finished baking, remove the trays from the oven. Use a spatula to transfer the cookies to a wire rack and allow them to cool completely, which should take 15 to 20 minutes.Cookies that are stored in an airtight container stay fresh for up to 5 days.  ","beat the butter. add the sugar. mix in the egg yolks, vanilla, and salt. stir in the flour. add cocoa for chocolate cookies. mix in ground nuts for nutty cookies. stir in dried cranberries and orange zest for cranberry citrus cookies. incorporate cinnamon for cinnamon sugar cookies. toss in some mini chips. form the dough into a ball and divide. refrigerate the dough. roll the dough into logs. wrap the dough in plastic and refrigerate again. roll the chilled dough in the coating of your choice. preheat the oven and line the cookie sheets. slice the dough logs into cookies. arrange the cookies on the cookie sheets. bake the cookies until they set. cool the cookies on a wire rack. finished.

"Focus on similarities rather than differences between you and your relatives. Even if you don’t have similar lifestyles or upbringing, there may be ways to connect them in a loving and accepting way. Give other people the benefit of the doubt, rather than assuming the worst.  For example, let’s say that your relatives watch certain TV shows or love certain video games. Maybe you have a different taste in things. Be willing to try these new things that they enjoy.  Let them be “the teacher” about certain things they like. Consider asking them things like, 'I see you like playing this video game. Tell me about some of the characters you like. What kinds of powers do they have?'  Avoid being negative about certain activities just because they are kid-oriented. Let’s say you’re in high school and you are hanging out with your eight year old cousin who wants to play with dolls. Avoid making them feel bad about what they like even if you think that playing with dolls isn’t fun or cool.  If you’ve got some one-on-one time with your younger relatives, or maybe you’re baby-sitting them, consider taking them to different places other than just shops or play places. If you’re active in your own community through small business, local government, or the creative arts, show them what you do.For example, let’s say that you’re an artist, and they are planning to show your art class’s works at a local community center. Consider taking them to see the community center and the art work.  Explore local history with your younger relatives. Maybe there are old factories, stores, parks, or museums in your town that highlight what life was like many years ago. Help them to appreciate their community through history.  Teach them to appreciate and respect others in their community.  Being a role model may also mean giving your support and undivided attention when you’re available and able to do so. Some young kids may have difficulty coping with stressors at school or at work. Focus on what they need and talk about what’s bothering them.Use active listening skills. Keep good eye contact. Provide validation if they’re talking about something difficult for them. Consider saying, “It sounds like that’s difficult” or “That’s a tough situation.”  Provide reassurance that they have support through you and others. Open up about what you can do to help or what support you can offer. Consider saying, 'I know you're going through a difficult time. Just know that I'm here for you. You can come to me if you need to talk about anything.'  Give hugs when they’re hurting. Give high-fives when they do something well. This helps to build their confidence.  Give young children a “secure base” where they can feel safe. If you’re visiting your younger relatives, and their home life is chaotic, then find other places such as your home or safe public places that make them feel secure. And vice versa, if they are anxious when in public, find out ways to make them feel protected in those public spaces.With young children under 10, keep a watchful eye on where they are and what they’re doing particularly in public spaces. Don’t let them wander too far without supervision.  Avoid taking them to places that may involve vulgar behavior or make them feel uncomfortable.  Don’t have them watch movies or TV that is mature in its content, particularly if it is scary or violent.  ","accept others. show commitment to your community. be an emotional support. make them feel safe. "

"Cystic acne affects tissue that is deeper down than its more superficial counterpart, common acne. Cystic acne is a type of abscess that occurs when oil ducts get infected, usually under the skin.For this reason, cystic pimples usually appear further underneath the surface than common pimples.;  , Scarring is more common in cystic acne, doctors say, because of the collagen-damaging infection of deep tissue.Cystic acne scars come in three basic forms:  Atrophic scars, sunken but mostly shallow, which can be effectively treated.Boxcar-shaped scars, which are harder to treat.  Ice pick-shaped scars, which are narrow and deep.  Although dermatologists and doctors alike warn against popping common pimples, many whiteheads and blackheads can be effectively popped, even if increases the chance of infection and worsens the inflammation. Cystic acne, on the other hand, cannot be effectively popped because it's further underneath the skin.  Lancing or draining the cyst with a sharp needle is a common medical procedure, but it should never be done at home or without the supervision of a licensed professional. Improper lancing may result in scarring or infection, and should not be attempted at home.  Cystic acne is not the debilitating and disfiguring condition it was before. More and more cystic acne patients are getting help with treatments and drugs, although the drugs have gotten more powerful and their side effects have increased. If you do have cystic acne, know that it can be effectively treated in the right circumstances.  Cystic acne is much worse than common acne; common home remedies often prove ineffective and even counterproductive. There are measures that you can take at home to help treat cystic acne, but they should be coupled with medical intervention from your doctor.  Doctors can prescribe very strong drugs that will help you treat your cystic acne. Because they are so powerful, they are not dispensed over the counter and can't be bought in your local drugstore. Setting an appointment with a doctor will allow him or her to look at your acne, devise a treatment tailored to your case, and start guiding you to a pimple-free existence sooner rather than later.  ","understand that cystic acne affects deeper skin tissue than common acne. understand that cystic acne, particularly, brings with it higher chances of scarring. understand that most cystic acne abscesses should not be popped. understand that drugs and anti-scarring treatment make cystic acne much more manageable than before. make an appointment with your dermatologist today to discuss cystic acne.

"As with all precious metals, platinum must be alloyed with other metals in order to achieve the hardness required for jewelry. A ring that is alloyed with 80% Platinum and 20% other metals is worth a lot less than a ring that is 95% pure platinum.;  , Federal regulations require all platinum bands to bear a stamp or 'hallmark' on the inside of the band. If it says 'IridPlat', or '.90Plat/Ir' then the ring is only 90% pure platinum, and you should pay less for it than a ring that is 95% pure platinum. If the hallmark says 'Plat' or '.95 Plat', then the ring is considered pure platinum and commands a premium price.  If you are buying a pure platinum ring (95% platinum), then it should be alloyed with either Cobalt or Ruthenium. These alloys produce a harder platinum that can hold a mirror bright polish and resist years of daily wear. Many .95 pure platinum rings are alloyed with the less expensive metal Iridium, but these rings are softer and will become scratched and dull within a year of daily wear.  Find an ultra-specialist focused on designing and handcrafting jewelry in platinum. Working in platinum is very difficult. The metal doesn’t melt until it reaches 3223º, unlike gold that melts at a mere 1700º. The tools needed to work in platinum are completely different as well. Given these challenges, there are but a few talented master platinum-smiths who have the expertise to make high-quality platinum rings. While some mass producers choose to outsource their platinum “artistry” to China to cut costs, the handful of masters trained in the finer art of platinum-smithing are in the US and Europe.  Platinum rings today come in thousands of designs with differing details to suit personal tastes. These details may include engraving, or deep cuts in the platinum that form a design. Some jewelry manufacturers choose to imitate hand engraving by embedding a design into the ring’s casting. This prefabricated engraving will eventually wear off and lose its luster. Therefore, look for deep and intricate hand engraving, which typically lasts for generations. Filigree is another design element reminiscent of the Art Deco period. Again, to save costs, many jewelers prefabricate filigree in the casting process. The result is chunky filigree that lacks elegance and finesse. True artistry from the Art Deco period calls for filigree that is created from hand-drawn wires and sculpted then soldered into a piece. For the best quality, ensure that any filigree in the platinum ring is handcrafted. Bezel set with pavé is another extremely popular platinum ring option. Bezel set refers to a border of metal, often set with small diamonds that accent the center stone – and can make it appear larger. Bezel setting with pavé in platinum requires very specific expertise. Proper setting ensures that the focus is on the sparkle of the diamonds, not the platinum prongs holding in the stones. Noticing these fine points today will ensure the right choice for years to come.  For those who wish to express their individualism and own a statement ring that will become a family heirloom, custom is the only way to go. Many big jewelry houses scorn custom work. If you don’t like one of their limited design choices, then you have too much imagination. Custom-made rings allow you to work with the designer to create the ultimate reflection of your tastes. The “build your own ring” online tools are a fun gimmick, but far from the true custom craftsmanship associated with a quality ring. Work with a knowledgeable, personal jeweler who can guide you in the process.  If high style and glamour are priorities in your life, go for a showstopper that’s loaded with exquisite hand artistry and a large center stone. If mountain climbing on Mount Kilimanjaro is your priority, forgo the delicate pavé work and opt for a platinum design with a low silhouette, that is, one that doesn’t elevate the center stone so that it won’t get banged around on rocks. Or, look at substantial platinum bands with unique engraving that look fashionable, yet are very practical. While most women fall somewhere in the middle, the point is that your ring needs to fit into your life. Some may feel more comfortable in a beautiful platinum band with an intricate floral design while others will gravitate toward a classic piece with a single center stone and filigree or the popular three-stone look with engraving. Nevertheless, since this purchase will likely be worn for ages to come, avoid the trendy, ultra-modern designs that promise to look dated in a few years.  Now that you’ve eliminated certain designs based on your lifestyle, figure out what looks best on your hand. a) Match the size of your ring to the size of your hand. If you are large-framed with large, angular hands, don’t choose a dainty piece that fades away. Rather look at bolder designs with a thicker platinum band or consider stacking several rings. If you are petite, choose more delicate pieces and plenty of details. b) Don’t be obsessed with the size of the center stone. It’s irrelevant that your best friend has a three carat. If it was set in white gold or poor-grade platinum, lacks style and its diamond has visible flaws, this is not a ring to covet. Think quality and substance in the design, the workmanship, the platinum alloy and the precious gems you select. c) Try on many ring styles to be sure. Some women are sure that they want a certain style of ring until it’s on their finger. What’s right for a cousin is not likely what’s perfect for you. This is similar to clothing shopping. Trying on a piece is essential to know that it suits your fingers and hand size, that the ring doesn’t twist or become off-centered easily or that it doesn’t look good when stacked with a wedding band.  If you have chosen a custom ring, you can ask your jeweler for a wax mold of your ring to ensure that the design meets your expectations before it is cast into platinum. Today, the best shops use computer-aided design (CAD) to create a three-dimensional image of your ring. Then, the jeweler creates a wax mold of the piece and the artisans refine its dimensions with extreme precision. Find out if your jeweler offers this service, which can eliminate any disappointment that your custom ring is not what you dreamed of. A few jewelers create a sterling silver and cubic zirconia version of a client’s custom ring before casting it in platinum to ensure that the ring is exactly what the client wants.  ","know the purity content of your platinum ring. check the hallmark on the inside of the ring. ask your jeweler about the alloy used in your platinum ring. seek a master platinum-smith. look for quality handcrafting in the engraving, filigree, pave or other fine details. consider custom rings for a one-of-a-kind heirloom piece. match your ring to your lifestyle. choose a style that looks best on your hand. ask your jeweler for a wax mold or silver replica of your ring.

"There are the obvious spots, like near fishermen or fishing boats, where bait, injured fish, and blood and guts are plentiful and may attract sharks.Other potentially dangerous areas include:  River mouths and channels. This is where food, dead animals, and fish that are flowing down-stream enter the ocean, making them great spots for sharks to hang out.Areas where sewage enters the water. The sewage attracts fish, which will attract sharks.Deep channels, near sandbars, or where the reef or sand drops off steeply. Sharks lurk in these areas to catch fish that wander out of the shallows.Where large groups of shark prey hang out. If there are seals pupping nearby or a population of other marine animals in the area, sharks may be hunting nearby and could easily confuse you with prey.;  , If sharks have recently been sighted, there should be warnings posted on the beach - heed them. If the beach is closed, come back another day., Sharks generally feed at dawn, dusk, and night, so stick to late morning or afternoon sessions., Most shark attacks occur because the shark confused a surfer with prey. Visibility is low in cloudy water, making it more likely a shark will confuse you with a seal and attack.Water can be especially murky following storms or heavy rainfall. Rain can also stir up baitfish and attract sharks., Some sharks, especially adult great whites, tend to avoid kelp forests., Again, it's highly unlikely you will ever see a shark, but some experts believe that some sharks migrate closer to land during October, possibly to give birth.So, if you're really anxious about having a run-in with a shark, maybe wait until November to break out the wetsuit.  ","avoid areas where sharks are likely to feed. look for warning signs. stay out of the water during prime hunting times. avoid murky water. consider surfing in areas dense with kelp. take a break during the month of october.

"Turn the oven on to 375 degrees F (190 C). Select a large baking sheet with rimmed sides. The rimmed sides will keep the kale from sliding off as you transfer the sheet from the oven.  If you don't have a rimmed baking sheet, you could use a large roasting pan. Just take care not to overfill the pan or the kale with steam instead of roast.  Wash the kale thoroughly to remove all dirt and grit. Pat the kale dry and tear or cut away the thick stems. Chop the kale into large pieces and dry them again with a clean kitchen towel or paper towel.To quickly dry the kale, try spinning it in a salad spinner until all the water is removed from the kale.  Place the chopped kale pieces in a large mixing bowl. Drizzle the kale with one tablespoon of olive oil, one clove of garlic, and salt and pepper. Toss the seasonings together with the kale so the kale is completely covered. Spread the kale on the baking sheet and bake it for 15 to 20 minutes. You should stir it every five minutes, until the kale is crispy and a bit dark in color.The kale doesn't need to be arranged in a single layer on the baking sheet. As the kale roasts, it will shrink down in size.  For the crispiest roasted kale, serve the kale right after you've removed it from the oven. Roasted kale works well as part of a cheese spread or crudité platter. For example, you could serve the roasted kale alongside pita chips and hummus or a veggie tray.  Roasted kale does not stay crispy for more than a day or two so try to eat the pieces quickly. If you must store them, place them in an airtight container for a few days.  ","heat the oven and prepare your baking sheet. wash and chop the kale. season and bake the kale. serve the roasted kale. "
";  , You'll find free lesson plans in the Sustainable Happiness and Health Education Teachers Guide.,  Ask them to interview the happiness person they know (provide some guiding questions for them). The idea with this activity is for them to figure out for themselves who strikes them as a happy person. Is it someone who is generous? Or thoughtful? Always supportive? Bubbly? Kind? One of the things you may instruct them ask is 'how have challenges in your life helped you to understand happiness?' Also, 'what advice would you give for living a happy life?'  ,  Young students will likely say that their parents and friends (including pets) have helped them to learn about happiness.  Older students are more likely to see their friends and the media as the current influences on their views of happiness.  If students don't readily suggest that they have learned about happiness from Nature, guide them toward this awareness. For example, you could ask them to write in their journal about one of their happiest or most enjoyable experiences in a natural environment.  Introduce students to highlights from research about happiness. There are excellent articles and books on positive psychology.(The Teachers Guide mentioned above also includes these highlights)  ,  This could include bringing in magazine advertisements, finding products that use the word 'happy' in the product name, finding internet advertisements that market products using happiness (e.g. Coca Cola's happiness truck). Encourage students to identify how the ads are associating happiness with material consumption. Are they effective? i.e. persuasive?  ,  Sustainable happiness reinforces the notion that we are all choice makers and that we can make choices on a daily basis that contribute to, or detract from, happiness and well-being. Therefore, when you are creating lessons, it's ideal to provide choices withing the assignment. Some gratitude activities include:  keeping a gratitude journal for a week (or two); the student lists 3-5 things each day that she/he is grateful for  writing a gratitude letter, and delivering it  creating an appreciation wall (in the classroom or the school)  , The sample above will help you to design a chart.  (See the video below to learn how to do this)  , This could be someone they know personally, or someone they have read about.  Discuss with the class what the character traits or attributes of a sustainable happiness hero might be. Offer various options for the students to 'present' their sustainable happiness hero: a conventional presentation, a poem, a song, through drawing or painting, writing a story, etc.  ,  They could try having a Buy Nothing Day - they try not to purchase anything for a day  They could try to reduce their consumption of a non-renewable resource  They could try to reduce their waste (e.g. reducing fast food consumption can reduce waste generation)  They could have a 'techno fast' - reduce their screen time, particularly cell phone use and see how this makes them feel and what other things they do with their time.  , Work with them to develop projects (individual or group projects) that bring the ideas into action.  ","familiarize yourself with the concept of sustainable happiness through reading articles on the topic and completing various activities that help you to understand its relevance to your life, both personally and professionally. use existing lesson plans or create your own lessons to help your students explore sustainable happiness for themselves. encourage students to discover what happiness means to them. help students to explore who, or what, has taught them about happiness. develop activities that assist students to develop happiness media literacy, looking at how happiness has become associated with material consumption. provide opportunities for students to express gratitude and appreciation. have students complete a sustainable happiness footprint chart for a week. guide students in the process of creating an interdependence map. have students identify a sustainable happiness hero. incorporate activities that help students to develop and appreciate compassion. , assign a 'shifting consumption' activity that helps students to explore choices for living more sustainably. have students identify how sustainable happiness could help to resolve a local or global 'problem'. , brainstorm with students about ideas for sharing sustainable happiness with others. share your sustainable happiness lessons with other teachers.

"To start, find a firm surface. Lay the infant on the firm surface with their face down. Make sure the infant's head is turned so they can breathe. Kneel near the infant's feet.You can also place the infant on your lap face down.  Use the heel of your hand. Deliver five quick blows to the area between the infant's shoulder blades. Hopefully, an object will pop out quickly.With an infant, be firm in the blows but do not use harsh force. You do not want to press too hard, as this could hurt an infant.

"Cats most commonly get tapeworms by ingesting a flea that has tapeworm larvae. Because of this, you can prevent tapeworms by using a flea preventative on your cat. If your cat already has fleas, you need to use a product to get rid of them. To control the fleas, and therefore the exposure to tapeworms, around your cat, you need to treat the cat and the environment.There are many topical products that work to control fleas on your cat. Flea medications include Revolution, Frontline, Advantage, Seresto flea and tick collar, and Capstar tablets.;  , If you find fleas on your cat, after treating the cat you will need to clean and treat your home to get rid of any fleas and eggs that have contaminated the home. If your cat got tapeworms from the infested environment, there is a high risk of other fleas carrying tapeworm larvae and reinfecting your cat. You should treat areas both indoors and outdoors, along with the area where your cat lives, plays, and sleeps. Otherwise, the fleas will continue to be a threat to your cat for up to eight months. You need to vacuum all floors, rugs, and furniture.The contents of the vacuum will need to be thrown away in the garbage and brought out of the house to prevent reinfestation.  Floorboards, tile, hardwood floors, rugs, carpets, and furniture should all be vacuumed to remove as many fleas and eggs as possible.  Pet bedding or any washable items, like sheets or towels, should be washed in hot water and dried in a dryer. Bed mattresses should also be vacuumed on the top, sides, and bottom.  After a through vacuuming, washing, and drying, the home will need to be treated with an insecticide.  For the best results consult veterinary staff or an exterminator for help in choosing the best product to eliminate fleas. An important component is to use a product which has residual effect on killing any new infestations and eggs in the future.  You may want to use a monthly medication to help control worms in your cat. Many heartworm medications will help prevent tapeworms. Talk to your veterinarian about putting your cat on a monthly worm medication. Don’t put your cat on any medication without talking to your vet first.Outdoor cats that hunt a lot may need to be frequently dewormed against tapeworms in order to keep tapeworms from becoming a problem.  You may want to consider keeping all your cats indoors. Cats get tapeworms from coming in contact with fleas or contaminated feces or rodents. By keeping your cat indoors, you eliminate his exposure to contaminants.Keeping your cat indoors doesn’t eliminate fleas completely, but it helps significantly reduce the risk of your cat contracting fleas.

"The first step is to think about what exactly you want to do with your medical certification. You should consider whether you would want the traveling lifestyle or not, and if you would need to decide if you'd be comfortable moving around a lot. Traveling for medical purposes allows you to have a more direct impact on a person's life. If traveling is something you are interested in doing, the next step is to branch out and find opportunities that would allow you to do so.;  , You should do some research on different reasons to travel in your specialization like research on the Internet or talking to your superiors. When looking for opportunities, consider how far and how frequent you would need to travel. Missionary trips like Doctors without Borders are popular for physicians. The physicians go to developing areas of the world to treat patients that don't have much or any access to health care.If you sign up to be a part of a frequent medical-travelling agency, begin accepting assignments to travel and begin giving medical care to other people. These assignments are often four-to-six month contracts. Domestic placements can be as short as a weekend and international placements can be up to two years long, so make sure to plan accordingly and look at the requirements for the organization you decide to work through. Once you find a group that does missionary trips, you sign up for it and start planning!  , If you are a physician going on a medically related trip, make sure you have an appropriate work visa if you are planning on traveling outside of your country. There is a booklet to refer to, as indicated in the picture.  Be aware of all of the risks, health-associated, that could occur. Certain Urgent Care centers administer respective vaccinations to the place of travel. It is important to give yourself this time because vaccines require time to take effect within the body. Especially if you are flying out of country, this is even more important.  If you are heading outside of the country, check to see if you are up-to-date with your vaccinations. Initial consultation at a travel medicine clinic should occur at least four to six weeks before you departure to give yourself time to get your immunizations and, if need be, any assessments in case an adverse reaction occurs.  The physician or future physician should know the local patient’s language to understand them effectively and be able to provide the needed care. He or she should also be aware of the local religious believes, which sometimes affect the patient treatments. Looking for the 'WORLDBOOK' encyclopedias in your library is a good place to start.  Once you know your date of travel, it is important to notify your boss and your colleagues that you will be out of town on a medical trip. This is necessary to ensure that people who might be trying to get a hold of you while you are gone know that it is highly unlikely for them to receive a prompt response to whatever it is that they needed for you, whether it be a consult or help on a case. It is considered appropriate to let your workplace know a month prior to the day you leave. Block the days you will be absent in your calendar so no future appointment are made for those dates that you will be gone.  When it is time to travel for your missionary or your volunteer medical trip, it is important to buy a plane ticket or other mode of transportation as soon as possible. Look to see if you know others within the trip who are going with you and book a flight together.  Sometimes it may be good to get to the location a couple of days before in order to get accustomed to the new environment, the new people, and local grocery stores that you will need to buy food from. Make sure that, along with booking transportation, you do not forget to book a place to stay as well. If going overseas, you should probably set up a means for people to contact you in an emergency.  For the patients, explain to them that you will be going out for medical relief trip for however long you are going for. Make sure that your patient is offered a chance to re-schedule their appointment with you for a later time or, if the appointment was to occur on a timely manner, refer him or her to another colleague with the similar certification and specialization as you for this one appointment.  If you will be gone for a significant period of time, you should probably find someone to take care of your house if you have houseplants and/or pets. Having some body look after your house is also good for security purposes in case anything goes wrong while you are away. Also, coming back to a clean house gives you a good feeling after being away from it after a while.  For a domestic flight: As the day of your flight approaches, you should pack your bags in advance to assure that you do not forget any of the essentials like your toothpaste, toothbrush, hair comb, etc. Keep in mind restrictions on carrying things on flights like toothpaste tube sizes, gel bottle sizes etc. Planning packing methods helps to save money on luggage fees. Make sure that you have a ride to the airport so you can save on parking fees.  If traveling abroad, make a checklist of important documentations and other things.  Double-check to make sure you have not left any loose ends before you leave on your medical trip. Print your boarding pass ahead of time. Check-in over the computer within 24 hours of your flight! Now you are ready to go! Safe travels!  ","think about where you want to take your career. look up work-related opportunities to travel. have the right credentials and certification. familiarize yourself with the diseases prevalent in the country of travel. make sure your physical examination records are up to date. familiarize yourself with the culture of your place of travel. take an absence for the time you will be gone. plan an itinerary. think about leaving a couple earlier than the required date. inform your current patients. find someone you trust to look after your home. pack. do not forget the essentials on international travels. get going!

"The process for enabling macros is the same for Excel 2010, 2013, and 2016. There is a slight difference for Excel for Mac, which will be detailed below.;  ,  In Excel for Mac, click the 'Excel' menu.  In Excel for Mac, click the 'Preferences' menu option.  In Excel for Mac, click 'Ribbon & Toolbar' in the 'Authoring' section.  In Excel for Mac, you'll see 'Developer' in the 'Tab or Group Title' list.  , When you record a macro, anything you click or do will be recorded, so a single slip-up can ruin the whole thing. Run through the commands you'll be recording a couple times so that you can do them without hesitation and without misclicks.  , You'll find this in the Code section of the ribbon. You can also press Alt+T+M+R to start a new macro (Windows only).  Make sure that you'll be able to easily identify it, especially if you're going to be creating multiple macros.  You can also add a description to explain what the macro will accomplish.  You can assign a keyboard shortcut to the macro to easily run it. This is optional.  This will create a Ctrl+⇧ Shift+letter keyboard combination to start the macro.  On Mac, this will be a ⌥ Opt+⌘ Command+letter combination.  , If you're only using the macro for your current spreadsheet, just leave it on 'This Workbook.' If you want the macro available for any spreadsheet you work on, select 'Personal Macro Workbook.'  , Your macro will begin recording.  Pretty much anything you do will now be recorded and added to the macro. For example, if you run a sum formula of A2 and B2 in cell C7, running the macro in the future will always sum A2 and B2 and display the results in C7.  Macros can get very complex, and you can even use them to open other Office programs. When the macro is recording, virtually everything you do in Excel is added to the macro.  This will end the macro recording and save it.  In order to preserve your macros, you'll need to save your workbook as a special macro-enabled Excel format:  Click the File menu and select Save.  Click the File Type menu underneath the file name field.  Click Excel Macro-Enabled Workbook.  If you have closed your file before running your macro, you'll be prompted to enable the content.

"If you are a medical professional who will be performing an anorectal exam, then your first step should be to explain to your patient what the exam entails. Then, have the patient sign a consent form if they agree to undergo the procedure.  You could explain the procedure by saying something like, “For this exam, I will be inserting a gloved finger into your rectum to check for abnormalities. You may experience some pressure and/or discomfort, but the exam only take a minute or two.”;  , Before performing any type of physical exam on a patient / person it's important to wash and sanitize your hands because you don't want to transfer any bacteria, viruses or parasites to them.Using warm water with soap is usually adequate, but you may want to use an alcohol-based sanitizing gel also. Dry your hands thoroughly and then put on a new pair of nitrile or latex-free examination gloves.  In the medical field, digital rectal exams (DRE) are typically done by your family doctor, gynecologist, proctologist, or nurse practitioner.  Proctology is the branch of medicine that deals with problems of the anus, rectum and colon.  Giving and receiving a digital rectal exam can be awkward or embarrassing for people, so acting professional and reassuring the patient / person is important.After explaining the procedure in general, ask the patient / person to remove their bottoms, lay of their side (typically left side down), bend their knees and place their hands near their chest — this is essentially the fetal position or on their left side with their knees flexed. Keep them covered with a gown or blanket for privacy and warmth. Place a protective pad under their buttocks as well.  DRE can be done with the patient / person standing. Women may be examined as part of the pelvic exam therefore they may be laying back with their feet in stirrups. Men are often examined while they are standing up, unless they are feeling nervous and then laying down may be more comfortable. Laying on their side is often more relaxing and provides better access to the anal canal.  To feel more comfortable, it may be best to have a DRE carried out by someone of the same gender. Man on man or woman on woman, a request for a nurse to be present is also an option.  It may also help ease anxiety and vulnerability to have a friend or family member present during the exam.  Position and drape the patient for warmth as well as privacy.  As a courtesy and to prevent the patient / person from being too shocked and uncomfortable, make sure the lubricant is warmed up a little before applying some to your index finger. Even room-temperature gel can feel cool and cause the anal canal to contract, which makes the digital exam more challenging. The goal is to have the anal tissue as relaxed as possible, so inserting a finger doesn't become uncomfortable or painful.  Sometimes a rectal examination is carried out using a local anesthetic in order to numb the anal area and reduce discomfort. This is particularly true if the examiner has large fingers and the examinee has an especially tight anal sphincter.Electric gel warmers are inexpensive and can be purchased at medical supply stores. Alternatively, most gels and lubricants can be warmed in a microwave for 20-30 seconds.  Once your finger and the anus is lubricated with warm gel, part the patient's / person's buttocks and slowly insert your index finger. It's best to ask the patient / person to take a deep breath during the insertion of the finger in order to relax them and prevent them from contracting their anal sphincter.To facilitate the insertion of the finger, slowly rotate or twist your hand at your wrist in a back and forth motion.  Right before inserting your finger, quickly assess the anus for any abnormalities, such as hemorrhoids (swollen blood vessels), warts, rashes or fissures (tissue tears).After your finger is fully the rectum, assess the anal tone (strength) by asking the patient / person to bear down and try to squeeze your finger.  Once inside the rectum, use your index finger to feel for any abnormalities, such as unusual bumps, hard spots, soft spots or fissures.Rotate your finger clockwise then counterclockwise to feel the entire internal circumference of the rectum. You can also palpate the prostate gland (in males) through the wall of the rectum. Feel anteriorly (towards the front) for the prostate, which has two lobes with a cleft between them.  A healthy prostate gland is smooth to the touch and not painful upon probing.If pressing on the prostate gland hurts, it may be a sign of benign growth, infection or cancer.  It's normal to feel like urinating when the prostate gland is pressed / probed from the anal canal.  Once you're finished with your assessment, slowly remove your index finger and examine the glove for the presence of any blood and/or mucus.Then clean off any lubricant around the anus and remove and dispose of your gloves, and wash your hands. Allow the patient to wipe themselves off in privacy with some soft tissue paper and let them know they can get dressed.  To remove your soiled glove, take your index finger of your other hand (which should be clean), place it under the cuff of the soiled glove, then pull down towards your fingers and peel it off.  The exam itself shouldn't cause bleeding, so if you see blood on your glove that could be a signs of hemorrhoids or another internal problems.  After the procedure, check to see how the patient is feeling, especially if he was nervous before the procedure began. Also, keep in mind that going from a laying to standing position can make some people feel faint, so encourage the patient to do this slowly and observe them for a few minutes.  If you notice blood in the toilet when you defecate (poop) or while you're wiping yourself afterwards, then schedule an appointment with your doctor. If your doctor suspects you are bleeding from somewhere in your digestive tract (large intestine or colon, particularly), then they may want to perform a colonoscopy.Common reasons to see blood include hemorrhoids, small anal fissures and broken blood vessels from straining or wiping too hard.  More serious, but unusual causes for blood include: anorectal cancer or some form of irritable bowel syndrome, such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease.  A normal finding means your doctor didn't find anything obvious, but an anorectal exam does not rule out all problems. Other tests, including a colonoscopy or x-ray, might be needed.  A DRE is typically performed without using any drugs or anesthesia because it's seldom painful.The exam only takes a few minutes to complete.  Another common reason to get an anorectal exam is to check the male prostate gland for abnormal growth or tenderness.The prostate is a walnut-sized gland that secretes fluid during ejaculation that protects and nourishes sperm cells. The prostate is located near the bladder and in front of the rectum, which makes it easy to check during a DRE. An enlarged or inflamed prostate causes internal pelvic pain and problems with urination, such as dribbling and trouble initiating.  In men, a DRE is done to check the size of the prostate gland and to look for abnormal bumps or tenderness. Slow benign prostate growth is very common (but not serious) in America men older than 50 years. However, a malignancy is serious and further tests and early detection increase the chances of recovery. Go for yearly checkups or more often if you think there might be a problem.  If your doctor thinks your prostate feels abnormal, they will likely order a blood test and look for your prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels. High PSA levels sometimes indicate prostate cancer.  Another test to help diagnose a prostate problem is a prostate ultrasound (transrectal ultrasound), which is often done in conjunction with a glandular biopsy (tissue sample).  Instead of waiting for a problem or noticeable symptoms to occur in your lower gastrointestinal (GI) tract, get regular anorectal exams. Most doctors recommend adding a DRE to your routine yearly physical exam, regardless if you're male or female.Men should consider a DRE with a proctologist as part of an annual prostate screening exam, particularly if they are older than 40 years. An annual digital exam and fecal occult blood testing (a sample of your stool) is recommended if you are over 40 years old. Women should get these tests done in conjunction with their annual gynecological exams.  For men, a DRE is often done standing and bent over at the waist as it's easier to access the prostate gland.  Uterine and ovarian cancer can also be tested for in women when a DRE is done along with a vaginal exam.In addition to rectal bleeding and urinary issues, other reasons for getting a DRE include: a change in bowel habits, pelvic and/or abdominal pain, and discharge or bleeding from your urethra.  ","explain the procedure and make sure consent is provided. sanitize your hands and wear gloves. reassure the patient / person and tell them to lay on their side. apply warm lubricant to your index finger. insert your finger into the anal canal gently. feel for any abnormalities. remove your finger and clean the area when finished. get an anorectal exam if you have blood in your stool. get an exam if you're a man and have trouble urinating. incorporate an anorectal exam into your yearly physical.

"You should only ever bathe an animal if they need to be bathed. Constant cleaning is unhealthy and dangerous for any kind of pet. Their immunity levels can lower and certain chemicals in shampoos and soaps can irritate and dry their skin.  If your quail desperately needs to be washed, or if advised by an avian vet, you can decide that it is necessary to bathe your bird.;  , It's good to be knowledgeable on what can go wrong when you decide to clean your quail. Your bird's immunity levels lower when soaked with water, making them more prone to illnesses such as a cold, and they could also accidentally inhale the water. Soaps and shampoos can also irritate and dry out your quail's skin and get rid of the important oils on their feathers.  This is why you shouldn't randomly decide your quail needs a bath when they actually don't. If your quail seems smelly to you, there's usually nothing to be concerned about and it's a poor reason to bathe your bird.  Is it dirt or gum? If it is a tougher substance that won't easily come off, you will need to seek a vet for help. Coarse scrubbing in an attempt to get it off will harm your quail's feathers.  You should never attempt to bathe a quail that is weak or ill. If you attempt to bathe an already unhealthy quail, you will put them in a life-threatening position. You need to seek veterinary care to help your quail get better.  ","decide whether you need to bathe your quail. understand the risks associated with bathing your quail. determine what the substance is that you need to clean off. examine your quail's physical state.

"No matter how tired you are, make two or three days a week mandatory in the gym. When you go doesn't matter - just do it before you get home in the evening. You need to start with a commitment. And a first step.;  , Five to ten minutes on the elliptical if you can.  Forget about three sets (unless you really are a professional athlete). One set of ten to twenty or so is enough. There does need to be enough weight to tire the muscle without straining. For most of us less really is more. If a workout is not as tedious, it'll be easier to do on a regular basis. The concept in fitness circles is called supersets - and they really are. If you want to progress faster, rotate among a few exercises for that extra super set.  DON'T rest between machines. Use machines rather than free weights, especially when getting started. They're designed to keep you in proper form.  , Curls are not needed. Arms are worked indirectly by chest, back or shoulder exercises. The more slowly that you move the weight, the better. If you rush, inertia takes over and you're not working the muscle over its full range. Even slower on the negative.  Go fast enough to sweat. No reading is allowed (it slows you down). Once you've settled into a routine, intersperse with 1 or 2 minute intense segments (interval training), where you push your heart rate an extra 10 or 20 BPM. Cool down for a few minutes. Stretch at the end of your workout. If you're up for more cardio, go for it but build up slowly.  , Eat more veggies and fruit and fewer dense foods, especially those that are high in fat. Skip the protein bars or drinks. Protein deficiency is rare in the US. Only professional athletes and some senior citizens regularly need supplemental protein.

"Children and teenagers with existing mental or psychological conditions seem more prone to drinking, as do children and teenagers who experience significant problems at home or who lack parental supervision and involvement. If your child falls into any of these categories, pay extra attention.  There is also some evidence of alcoholism “running in families.” If your child has a close family member with a drinking problem, he or she may have an increased risk.;  , Children and teenagers who have been drinking exhibit the same symptoms of intoxication that adults do: they slur their speech, become less coordinated, walk unsteadily, and show signs of impaired attention and memory. They may feel dizzy, vomit, or pass out.  Intoxication does not necessarily indicate alcoholism. Many teenagers get drunk once or twice – or even more often than that – without ever becoming dependent on alcohol. Nevertheless, it’s vital to take underage drinking seriously. Let your child know that you do not want it to happen again, and pay attention to his or her behavior in the future.  Children and teenagers who abuse alcohol have significant problematic behaviors and psychological changes associated with drinking: mood instability, impaired judgment, poor social or occupational functioning, aggressive behavior, and inappropriate sexual behavior. If you notice these signs of alcohol abuse, take them seriously. Your child needs help.  Alcohol abuse may entail physically dangerous behaviors like driving under the influence, which can also lead to legal problems. Be aware that someone who abuses alcohol is likely to put himself or herself (and others) at risk.  As someone becomes dependent on alcohol, he or she will need to drink more and more to get the same effects. In addition, he or she will experience withdrawal symptoms when alcohol is not available. These symptoms include aches, pains, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, restlessness, nightmares, and mood swings. Alcohol dependence (or alcoholism) is extremely serious, especially for children and teenagers. Get your child help if you notice these symptoms.  Sometimes children and teenagers manage to develop problems with alcohol without clearly exhibiting the signs of intoxication, abuse, or dependence to their parents. In these cases, many parents don’t realize there’s a problem until a child’s grades start slipping. A rapid decline in academic performance should be taken seriously. Talk to your child, and follow up with his or her teachers to get more information about your child’s trouble at school.  Make a particular effort to talk to your child’s teachers about attendance. Alcoholic teenagers often skip classes.  Alcoholism makes children and teenagers much more likely to get into trouble. If your usually obedient child suddenly becomes rebellious at home, or if you start receiving complaints about your child’s behavior from teachers, coaches, classmates, other parents, or law enforcement officers, view that as a warning sign.  As they begin to drink more and more, teenagers will need money to pay for alcohol. If your child asks you repeatedly for money, seems unable to account for his or her spending, or steals from you or from siblings, this is cause for concern.  Teenagers often begin using and abusing alcohol when they start spending time with new friends – especially if these new friends are older and lack parental supervision. If your child seems to have dropped his or her old friends in favor of new ones, pay attention – especially if this happens alongside other warning signs.  Alcoholics tell lies, even compulsively. Your child may be dishonest with you about where he or she is spending time and who he or she is spending it with. You may find that your child stays out later than permitted or sneaks out of the house at night, then lies and makes excuses to cover this behavior.  If your child begins careening from happiness to anger to depression to irritability, this may be a cause for concern.  Keep in mind that many perfectly normal teenagers have mood swings. Don’t jump to conclusions, but do pay attention and look for other symptoms.  If your child seems much less interested in or enthusiastic about his or her studies, hobbies, and extra-curricular activities, this may also be a warning sign. You may notice that your child still does these things, but with less focus and dedication, or you may realize that your child is not doing these things at all anymore.  Most of our memory formation happens during our sleep, but alcohol disrupts sleep and, as a result, causes problems with memory retention. Watch your child’s sleep patterns, and note any difficulty with memory.  When someone is under the influence of alcohol, the brain’s ability to send warning signs is inhibited, and the person will not modify his or her behavior (as would be the case if the person were sober). If your child is consuming and abusing alcohol, you will likely see signs of diminished rational thinking and impaired judgment.  Note that alcoholics often fail to step back and make amends for mistakes they commit under the influence. They may not seem to care. This is why alcohol consumption becomes responsible for so many accidents, homicides, suicides, and acts of sexual violence – alcohol is that potent.  Alcohol is a depressant. It may reduce tension and anxiety temporarily, but it also works as a “downer” on the nervous system. If your child is abusing alcohol, he or she may appear very depressed – tired, sad, and withdrawn.  Alcohol has no nutritional value and, furthermore, it prevents the body from absorbing vital nutrients like thiamin, vitamin B12, and folic acid. As a result, teenagers who use alcohol often experience a decline in their general health.  If your child is using alcohol, you may notice that he or she complains of frequent headaches, stomachaches, nausea, and sleep disturbances.  Alcoholism also negatively affects eyesight, coordination, and hearing.  Because alcohol prevents the body from getting energy by filling it with empty calories, you may notice sudden changes in your child’s weight. If these changes do not seem to have another cause, this may be a warning sign.  If you suspect your child has been drinking, look for dilated pupils and trouble focusing. You may also notice red eyes and a reddish tinge in the face.  If your child is abusing alcohol, he or she may stop paying attention to hygiene and appearance. You may notice that your child smells offensive, looks dirty, or appears sloppy and disheveled.  ","understand the risk factors for alcohol abuse and dependence. watch for signs of intoxication. be alert for signs of alcohol abuse. know the signs of alcohol dependence. watch for declining academic performance. look for new behavioral issues. note any increased need for money. pay attention to changes in your child’s social life. look for signs of lying and other deceitful behavior. be aware that volatile moods can be a sign of alcoholism. watch for diminishing motivation. pay attention to memory problems. look for impaired thinking and judgment. be alert for signs of depression. watch for declining health. note any weight changes. check your child’s eyes. look for decreased attention to physical appearance and grooming.

"Curing salmon brings out the best in its fishy flavor, and little subtleties like the salmon's fat content and freshness will stand out after the curing process. The fresher and fattier the salmon, the better your gravlax will taste, so choose the highest quality salmon possible.  Check the salmon's labeling. Look for sustainably-sourced salmon that was not previously frozen. It's easier to find this while salmon is in season during the summer months. Salmon that has been frozen and thawed will not taste as good after curing.  To make enough for eight servings, get a two-pound salmon filet with the skin still attached. The flesh should be bright orangish-pink and firm. The skin should look bright and shiny, not spotted or damage.  Buy the salmon the same day you're planning to start the curing process, if possible. Store it in the refrigerator until you're ready to use it.;  , It's increasingly popular to rub alcohol over the fish before coating it in a cure. Using vodka, bourbon, rye or another alcohol is not traditional when it comes to the lox you'd get in a deli for your bagel, but it can add a lot of depth during the curing process. If you wish to use alcohol, you'll only need a few tablespoons, enough to rub over the entire filet before you coat it in the cure., The most basic ingredient of a salmon cure is salt. Salt draws the moisture from the fish's flesh, changing the taste and texture and acting as a natural preservative. Sugar, spices and citrus zest may be added to provide extra flavor. Start with a basic cure the first time you cure salmon, then consider getting creative and adding your favorite spices and alcohol for a different flair the next time around. Use the following ratio of ingredients for one two-pound piece of salmon:  1/2 cup kosher salt (not table salt, which can negatively affect the flavor)  3 tablespoons white sugar  3 tablespoons of the fresh chopped herbs of your choice, like oregano, dill, basil, fennel or a combination  1/2 tablespoon white pepper  Optional: 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) lemon zest  , When you're ready to star the curing process, remove the salmon from the refrigerator and rinse it in cool water, then dry it thoroughly with paper towels., The salmon will need to be tightly wrapped in plastic as it cures. Tear off a few large sheets of plastic wrap and place them on a baking sheet. Lay the salmon fillet skin-side down in the center of the plastic.  Gently press into the flesh of the filet with your fingertips to feel for tiny pin bones. They're usually located near the center of the filet. It's important to remove these before curing the salmon, since they'll interfere when it comes time to slice it up. When you come upon a bone, use a needle-nosed plier to pry it from the flesh, taking care not to damage the filet too much as you do so. Discard the bones when you're finished.  Time to apply the alcohol and cure mixture to the salmon to begin the curing process. Use enough to cover the filet on both sides. Err on the side of using too much instead of too little, since you can always rinse off the excess flavoring later.  Rub the salmon with alcohol. Use a tablespoon or two of the alcohol you chose to cover the salmon on both sides. No need to rub it in with pressure; instead, just smooth it over the surface.  Apply the cure. Use a spoon to sprinkle a good coating of the cure mix over the entire filet. Flip it over and put more on the other side.  Lift the sides of the plastic wrap and wrap up the salmon so that it's tightly covered with no air holes. You may want to get another piece of plastic wrap to make sure the wrapping is secure.  Place a second baking sheet over the first one. Nest it in so it's sitting directly on top of the salmon. If you don't have a sheet that fits perfectly, find another flat-surfaced pan or dish to do the job. Put a heavy bowl, a brick, or heavy canned goods on top of the entire contraption. This will compress the cure ingredients into the salmon, creating the right conditions for it to cure.  During this time, do nothing to the salmon except wait patiently while it cures. Most chefs recommend three days of refrigeration, though some recipes specify curing for two. It's a matter of taste, so if you prefer salmon that's less salty, go for two instead of three., Remove it from the refrigerator and take off the plastic wrap. Rinse the fish under cool running water, washing away the salt and other cure ingredients. If you skip this step, the fish will taste too salty.  Use a very sharp knife to cut thin horizontal slices from along the top of the salmon (rather than slicing it vertically as you would a steak). Gravlax has a strong flavor, so thinner slices are more palatable. The salmon is now ready to enjoy.  Taste the salmon for flavor. If you find it too salty, give in an extra rinse before continuing to slice it.  The classic way to serve gravlax is with a fresh bagel, cream cheese, sliced red onion and capers. It also makes a great topping for salads, pizzas, crostini, pasta and more.  ","choose a fat, fresh filet. choose your alcohol. mix up a cure. rinse and dry the salmon. lay the salmon on several sheets of plastic wrap. check the salmon for pin bones. dress the salmon filet. wrap the salmon tightly. weight the salmon. refrigerate the salmon for 72 hours. unwrap and rinse the fish. slice the salmon.

"Ensure you wear sunscreen with strength of at least 30 SPF. Look for a sunscreen that has both UVA and UVB protection. Cover your face, nose, neck, arms, and shoulders. These are the areas most exposed to the sun and the areas that tend to burn most easily. If your chest or back are exposed, cover them with an even coat of sunscreen, too.Avoid scented sunscreens, as they attract bugs.Additionally, wear sunglasses. Protecting your eyes is extremely important no matter the weather. Choose sunglasses that offer 99% or greater UV protection., Do not push yourself beyond what you can manage. If you’re new at exercising, or if you exercise only irregularly, keep your hot weather walk brief. For instance, you might have a ten-minute hot weather walk to gauge your fitness level. If you feel fine throughout the walk, you could increase your hot weather walk to 15 minutes the next time around.Keep in mind that your hydration level will greatly affect how you feel before and after your walk.  Continue to add time to your hot weather walk in five-minute increments up to a time limit you feel is adequate and safe.  Factor your own health and medical history into your decision to head out for a hot weather walk. For instance, if you have a medical condition that is exacerbated by hot weather (such as heart failure), or are taking medication (like diuretics) that could put you at greater risk for a heat-related illness, avoid hot weather walks.Talk to your doctor if you are unsure about the relationship between hot weather walks and your medication or medical history.  If you believe you have any reason to be concerned about taking a hot weather walk, stay indoors.  Take a rest under some shady trees or head home if you feel you cannot complete the full circuit you’d planned on walking.  Despite your best attempts to stay hydrated and dress properly, you may still succumb to the heat. Learn the signs and symptoms of too much heat exposure to know when your body needs respite. There are several heat-related illnesses that may afflict you if you fail to stay cool on hot weather walks. Common heat-related illnesses include:Heat exhaustion. If you suffer from heat exhaustion, you might experience nausea, vomiting, headache, fainting, thirst, or feelings of general weakness. Your skin may become cold, pale, and clammy.Heatstroke. Heatstroke occurs when heat exhaustion is left untreated. You’ll experience all the symptoms of heat exhaustion, plus a few additional symptoms. Your skin will be hot and your heart might be racing. You may or may not sweat. Seek medical attention immediately if you have heatstroke.  Heat cramps - Heat cramps cause the muscle to contract painfully. Your body temperature might remain normal and your muscles might feel tense or firm.  Heat syncope and exercise-associated collapse – Heat syncope causes feelings of lightheadedness or fainting in high temperatures. This is unlikely to affect you during hot weather walks, since it tends to occur after standing for a long period of time. A related condition, exercise-associated collapse, also causes feelings of lightheadedness or fainting, but you are more likely to experience it because it tends to strike after exercising (such as after vigorous walking).  ","use sunscreen. know your own fitness level. stay on the lookout for heat-related illness. "
"The longer the hair of your Maltese, the more time you will spend on grooming. A puppy cut is the shortest cut and requires the least amount of maintenance. Long and medium length hair is more prone to knots and tangles.  Puppy cuts are also best if your dog has a more cottony texture as opposed to a silky texture.  Use dog clippers or scissors to cut the hair.  If you do not want to cut your dog's hair yourself, take it to a professional groomer for a cut.  The frequency of hair cutting will depend on how fast your dog's hair grows.  Tear stain removers are specially formulated cleansers that will remove the stains from white fur. Always read the instructions on the bottle before using. Typically, you will wet the area, apply the stain remover using a wet cloth, and then rinse the area with clean water.  The most popular brands of tear stain removers include Angle Eyes, Eye Envy, Betta Bridges, and Tropiclean.The frequency of use may vary depending on if you are treating existing stains or preventing stains.  You can always ask your veterinarian to recommend a product for you to use.  Some Maltese will stain more than others. If you are concerned about your dog's tear staining, see a veterinarian to make sure that everything is fine.There may be other reasons that your dog is having a big problem with tear staining. Once you know the cause of the tear staining, you can use the right solution.  Excessive tear production, blocked tear ducts, other eye diseases, diet, and ear infections can cause your dog to have more tear stains.If your Maltese is a teething puppy, you may also notice more tear stains.  Maltese have a lot of hair around their ears. Excessive amounts of hair can cause ear problems for your dog. Sprinkle some ear powder on the ear canal and all of the ear hair. Hold the ear flap up with one hand, and use your fingers to pluck hair out of the ear canal.The ear powder will keep your dog from feeling pain when you pluck.  If you are not comfortable doing this, take your dog to a professional groomer.  Ear powder can be purchased from your local pet store.  Your dog may not be to fond of grooming at first. However, you need to get your dog used to the grooming process. Get all of your supplies together before you start a grooming session. This will make the session as short and efficient as possible.If your dog does not like being touched in a certain spot, touch the spot for a few seconds to help your dog get used to it.  Reward your dog when it is well behaved during grooming.  You can also start with short grooming sessions and build your way up to longer sessions.

"For the first 3 weeks of life, feed them a starter diet that is 18-20% protein and consists of small pellets (about 1/8').  Duck food can be bought at your local pet store. Some reputable manufacturers of duck food are Purina, Mazuri, or Gunter.  Though chicken feed can be substituted for duck food, chicken feed should not be fed to ducklings.Once the ducklings reach 20 weeks of age, you can substitute duck food for chicken feed with the same amount of protein.;  , Male and female ducks will both need the same amount of protein. Check the back of your duck food bag for nutritional information.  You can begin to feed the female ducks this higher protein diet in the spring time, when they are likely to begin laying eggs.  These treats should compromise no more than 15-20% of a duck’s diet. Cut all treats into small pieces. You can also let your duck graze outside, provided the area they are grazing has no pesticides or other toxic materials.  Don’t season or cook these treats. Feed them raw.  Bread, chocolate, onion, garlic, popcorn, avocados, and citrus fruits should not be fed to ducks.  Remove the food at night so it does not begin to rot or attract ants and rats. Each duck will consume about 6-7 ounces of food per day, but bigger ducks may eat a bit more.  Buying duck food in bulk will work for feeding large flocks, but for smaller flocks, buy small amounts of food frequently so they will have fresh food all the time. Moldy food can make ducks very sick.Store leftover duck food where it can keep dry.  This water can be provided in a trough, an outdoor pond, or a shallow bucket. Any large, open container the ducks can fit their bill in will suffice. If you decide to use a watering system, such as those designed for chickens or turkeys, just make sure the ducks can reach the water.  The water should always be clean, as ducks are especially prone to botulism.  Change the water daily.  Newborn ducks need to be kept at 86°F (30°C) for the first week and at 81°F (27°C) after that.  After 4-6 weeks, ducks can regulate their temperature and no longer need to be kept in a brooder.  Brooders can easily be bought online or at a pet store.  If your ducklings seem to be panting, turn the brooder temperature down a couple of degrees.  Ducks that are 35 days old or older and ducks who are laying eggs need to be kept at 55°F (13°C). Ducks that are clustering together are likely cold, and if they are panting, they are too warm. Watch for this, and adjust the temperature accordingly.Provide cool water for ducks to swim in if the weather is extremely hot.  Keep the ducks somewhere you can maintain the temperature.  Newborn ducklings only require 289 square centimeters (.31 sq ft) each to roam, and this amount increases as they age. Ducks 3 days of age need 1024 sq cm (1.10 sq ft), ducks 1 week old need 2304 sq cm (2.48), and ducks laying eggs need 2500-2809 sq cm (3 sq ft)., If the pen has wire floors, floors for ducklings under 3 weeks should be constructed of 1.9 cm (3/4 inch) mesh and 12-gauge welded wire. This should be attached to a frame designed to keep the wire flat and minimize manure accumulation. For ducks over 3 weeks, use 2.5 cm (1 inch) mesh. Vinyl coated wire or smooth galvanized wire is preferred.  The pen should be secure enough so the ducks do not escape.  The shelter should protect from raccoons or bobcats, especially if the shelter is outside.  Non-wire floors are fine, as long as there aren’t lots of places the ducks can scrap their fragile feet.  Ducks are messy birds with liquid excrement, which is why you must sanitize the housing with a non-toxic disinfectant at least 3 times a week.Their housing also needs ventilation, such as an open window. If your ducks are being kept indoors, be sure they are getting air.  At many points during the year, the sun is not out this long. Turn on artificial lights once the sun sets to provide 14-17 hours of light for the ducks.  During the spring time, female ducks will begin to lay eggs, so you should provide them with plenty of peace and quiet, food, and a nearby water source. If you do not want more ducklings, simply remove the eggs from the laying duck soon after she lays them. Ducks like to hide their eggs, so you may find them unexpectedly.  It is normal for a duck to abandon her eggs. She may hatch them next time.  Ducks can lay one egg at a time or 14, depending on the duck.  Once she has laid about 1 dozen eggs, they will hatch in about one month, though some may not survive.Place newborns in the brooder.  Talking to your ducks will help you bond with them. You can name them, too.  Ducks have been known to do tricks and be somewhat affectionate. You can buy some bird toys to play with them, or simply take the ducks in the bathtub for a swim. Every duck has a different personality. They may even play with string or try to dig holes.  If they seem lethargic, are losing feathers, or don’t have an appetite, you should take them to a vet. The vet will provide care and necessary medication.  ","feed ducklings and adolescent ducks a diet that is 18-20% protein.young ducks grow quickly, and as a result, they need food that has a lot of protein and is high in calories. feed ducks over the age of 3 weeks a diet that is 14% protein. feed laying ducks a 16-17% protein diet that has 3-4% calcium.this amount of calcium is needed for laying ducks to make quality eggs. offer occasional treats like corn, carrots, and greens like cucumber or broccoli. provide food at all times during the day.ducks should be allowed to graze freely on their food. buy small amounts of fresh food more frequently. provide cool 50-70°f (10-21°c) and clean drinking water. keep newborn ducks in a brooder for 4-6 weeks.ducklings cannot yet regulate their body temperature, so a brooder (a heated poultry box) is necessary. keep adult ducks at their optimum temperature. provide a pen large enough for the ducks to walk around. house the ducks in a pen with adequate protection and flooring. keep the housing clean and well-ventilated. provide the ducks with 14-17 hours of light every day. allow nesting mothers to hatch their eggs. talk to your ducks.just like humans, ducks can hear and respond to sound. play gently with the ducks. take your ducks to the vet if they look ill. during feeding time, observe your ducks for any health problems.

"Anything you can do to increase your feeling of control will usually help you and your teen drive calmly together. As the parent of a new driver one of the most important things you can do is increase your teens feeling of safety and control. Let them know you're there for them, and want to help them, even if it sounds like you're upset. Their sanity is your sanity. If the kids feel like you're micromanaging them, they don't feel in control, which stresses them out, which makes them drive worse, which stresses you out... and then the vicious cycle repeats itself.  Many people hold their breath when they're nervous, which depletes the oxygen in your blood and is sure to leave you feeling stressed out. Whenever you feel stressed, take a few deep breaths. 2 seconds in, 2 second pause, 2 seconds out. Do that a couple of times and you'll feel your blood pressure start to drop. It almost seems too simple, but it can be incredibly effective.  We all know drinking water is important to our health but in times of stress it also helps calm us down. Think about it, if you were being chased by a hungry animal and feeling stressed out, you wouldn't stop to take a drink of water until you're out of harm's way. Water helps send signals to our bodies that the danger has passed.  If you're not helping your teen, you're distracting them. Only speak when they're doing something wrong or to give them simple praise. One more thing, don't speak in turns/intersections unless it's absolutely necessary. If kids are going to have trouble anywhere it's usually in a turn so if you don't have something driving related to say, don't say anything at all.  You've probably heard 'it's not what you said, it's how you said it.' In the car your voice needs to be the security blanket that lets them know you've got their backs. Often, the words you're saying aren't helpful, but how you say them is helpful. If you speak in a calm and relaxing tone, your teen feels reassured and supported, which helps them stay calm and drive better. If they sound annoyed I know they need to be reassured, calmed, and receive supportive language. If they sound mad, they're probably feeling embarrassed, insecure, or maybe they felt like I was being critical.  Parents often find it hard to drive calm with their kids because when they try to say something their child misinterprets the words and it seems like they're not listening. The parent might say something like, 'you didn't listen to me, I told you to slow down, why didn't you slow down!!?'  , When you're driving, decide well in advance what they should do when they reach upcoming situations. When they reach the situation, if their foot is over the brake then they are thinking about stopping. If their foot is over the gas, they're thinking about going. If they're looking at the lane they need to turn into but not at the car that's coming towards the intersections, don't yell at them. Just say something like 'do you see that white car?' and usually that's enough to imply there's a problem (remember when you talk, they usually assume there's a problem).  When you drive, having options is critical to your sanity. You need to be thinking about problems before they happen. All it takes is a little foresight, and you can be ready for almost anything your teen or traffic can throw at you.  ","the biggest source of stress for parents is: loss of control. breathe. drink water. know when to open your mouth. tone is critical. be specific. read your teen's mind. find your out. "
"Preventative gastropexy is a non-invasive surgical procedure that can be performed on dogs that are prone to bloating and torsion. There are a few different procedures when performing gastropexy, but most result in adhering part of the dog’s stomach to their torso to prevent torsion.Consult your vet to see which gastropexy options are available and which might be most effective for your dog., Feeding your dog only one large meal a day can cause bloating and torsion as your dog will likely be eating too quickly. Separate your dog’s daily food allotment into 2 to 3 smaller meals throughout the day in order to promote healthy eating and digestion. Align your dog’s eating schedule with your own, give them food before you begin your day in the morning and food again in the evening.Try using automatic dog feeders if you find that your schedule will not allow you to feed your dog multiple regular meals.  Many dry foods can be too rich in carbohydrates and be over processed for dog’s digestive systems. Dogs who eat highly processed grain diets will often have weaker stomach muscles, which can increase the risk of bloat and torsion. Add high protein wet food to your dog’s meal to increase your dog’s nutrition and digestive activity so that they can naturally decrease their risk of bloat or torsion.Start by supplementing half of your dog’s dry food for wet food.  Consult your vet or local pet store about high protein wet foods. Ask questions like, “Which wet foods do you recommend for my dog?” or “Is there a particular food or brand that helps combat bloating and torsion?”  , Exercising your dog after they have just eaten increases their risk of bloating or torsion as their stomach will be full, heavy, and easier to twist. Give your dog at least 2 hours of digestion time before you take them on a walk or have high energy play. Try feeding your dog an hour after they have exercised to create a simple and healthy feeding routine.  ","ask your vet about preventative gastropexy. feed your dog smaller meals throughout the day. add high protein wet food to your dog’s meals. avoid exercise after meals. "
"Open the window and/or run a fan. Wear non-porous gloves, a mask, and safety glasses.  Chlorine bleach is an eye and skin irritant. The fumes can affect the respiratory tract. Adequate protection and ventilation are essential., Mix three parts water to one part chlorine bleach. Alternately, you can purchase a cleaning solution that contains some bleach.If your grout is colored, using bleach may cause it to fade, especially if used regularly.  You can repeat this method with a slightly higher concentration of bleach (for example, half bleach, half water) if the 3-to-1 ratio doesn’t work.  Never attempt to mix other chemicals with diluted bleach. For example, ammonia – found in many cleaning agents – emits toxic fumes when mixed with bleach.  Thoroughly wet any tiles in the area with warm water before using any bleach solution. Even if you’re just cleaning the grout, spatter will land on tiling. Pre-wetting tiles with water saturates them to limit their absorption of chemicals., Use a narrow brush such as an old, stiff toothbrush or any natural bristle or nylon brush. Scrub the grout with the solution in small sections.Bleach can lighten mold so that it isn’t visible. Scrubbing is needed to reach into grout’s pores and remove organic growth., Let the solution remain on each section of grout for about three minutes. Then rinse it clean with clear water.Letting bleach sit for more than a few minutes can cause staining, streaking, or even breakage to tile.  Buff away any remaining moisture with clean cloths. Leave the window open or fan running until the grout feels totally dry.  ","ensure proper safety and ventilation. make a diluted bleach solution. wet tiles with water. apply the bleach solution. soak and rinse the grout. dry the grout. "
"Spread out your ingredients in newspaper-covered large pans such as a cookie sheet or table.Put the ingredients in place in a place that is dry and under direct sunlight such as in front of a window.  You will not need to dry the asafoetida.  If you are using fresh red chilli peppers or fresh coriander seeds, you will need to dry these ingredients in advance for about a week.  Add a dash of cooking oil in your pan. Then fry the asafoetida for 2 to 3 minutes until it changes to a light yellowy colour. Remove the asafoetida from the pan.  It's important that you are using a whole piece of asafoetida when frying in oil and not the powder. If you are using an asafoetida powder, you can add it directly into the sun dried ingredients during grinding.  Cooling down the ingredients prevents wet lumps from forming during grinding. A good wait time would be about 15 to 20 minutes for everything to completely cool down.  Grind everything in a food processor. If you are making a large batch, you may need to grind everything in batches.  Alternatively, you can bring your ingredients to a grinder mill or grinding store where they will have large machines to grind the ingredients for you.

"you could always say you were doing a different type of move. Call it the 'Northern Side Swing Grip' or 'The Left-Right Winged Pass'. These names can make you seem that you know the sport.;  , Avoid being a goalie. Stay on the outsides.  For example even a mediocre shooter could focus on Free Throws and become a high percentage free throw shooter just by focusing on shooting free throws and learning a few techniques. Pick a skill that can be repeated in much the same way each time.  Admit to the coach that you are not that skilled (they already know this, remember!) but explain to them that it is important to you to get better.  Develop the basic and easy to achieve attributes such as strength, speed, agility and flexibility.  Maintain these attributes in the off-season, and during the season, as they will vanish if you do not. Although technique and experience are longer lasting qualities, a good athlete must have an edge and be totally developed. Decrease your reaction time in your sport by increasing your strength and speed.  Do not be misled by labels. Improving these simple qualities involve technique. For example, when lifting a heavy weight notice how important it is to use your leg and back muscles. Apply this insight to a more complex, athletic movement and use your legs and back to throw, swing or hit. In another example, when practicing for speed, if you truly love your sport that you are practicing for, you will be thinking how to apply this speed work to your sport. Develop in your speed work time sprints and speed drills for your sport.  Maintain your priority. If your priority is your sport, develop these helpful attributes so they will not interfere with your regular sports session. Start a modest supplemental program, strive to keep learning and progressively improve on these attributes. If doing extra work after your sport, do them after. Do not lift weights and run sprints before your sport.  Learn in a few day what might take you a few months to learn thru experience. The learning process is great, however do not try to reinvent the wheel.. it has already be invented.  If you mess up, just laugh and move on. You'll be making something bigger of it then it really is, if you act embarrassed.  It's very mean for someone to make fun of you, but if you just ignore it, they'll know it doesn't bother you, and stop.  If you just can't seem to enjoy yourself, maybe this sport isn't right for you.  ","keep in mind that, if you make a bad move (swing the wrong way, drop the ball, etc.), remember, if you're playing a game with many players (soccer, football, hockey), try to stay where the ball isn't going to be. pick one specific skill that you can be good at to add value to your team. get to know the coach of your team to get the inside scoop on the best way to blend. compensate for your lack of athleticism with qualities such as strength, speed, agility and flexibility. learn from others thru observation, coaching, watching games and reading books. laugh at your mistakes!, ignore someone, if they make fun of you. have fun!

"The main symptoms of giardiasis are abdominal cramps and bloating, flatulence (gas) and watery foul-smelling diarrhea that may alternate with soft, greasy stools.As such, you shouldn't get too far from a bathroom because you'll need one frequently throughout the day for at least 2 weeks and maybe as long as 6 weeks while your body combats the infection.  The bloating and cramps may make it difficult to walk, so don't plan on any hikes or being too active until you're back to full health.  Consider postponing any holidays if you get giardiasis because you'll likely be too uncomfortable to enjoy the trip.  If you're out of your house shopping or doing errands, always carry some wet wipes in case you have to use a toilet that doesn't have any toilet paper.;  , The Giardia parasite survives outside the body within feces (poop) as spores. These hard spores can live almost anywhere for long periods of time until they get ingested via contaminated water, food or from someone's unwashed hands. The spores then hatch in your stomach or small intestine and cause infection. Washing your hands after going to the bathroom will prevent you from getting re-infected and infecting your friends and family.Be especially careful washing your hands after changing diapers or picking up pet feces.  Always make a habit of washing your hands with soap and water before eating or preparing food.  While sick with the symptoms of giardiasis, resting is important because it'll allow your immune system more energy to fight off the infection.You'll likely be very tired due to the nausea, diarrhea and lack of appetite (which severely limits your eating), so taking some naps during the day shouldn't be difficult to do. Your immune system tends to kick it into 'high gear' when you sleep.  Some walking and light housework is fine, but take a break from the gym and other vigorous physical activities until you feel much better and stronger.  Since a primary symptom of giardiasis is moderate-to-severe diarrhea, dehydration from fluid loss is always a concern. As such, replenishing your fluids throughout the day is important, so aim for at least 64 ounces of purified water (eight 8-ounce glasses). If you're very nauseous and having trouble keeping liquids down, try taking small sips of water or sucking on ice chips.In addition to water, drinking some fresh fruit / veggie juice is important to replenish your electrolytes (mineral salts), which are lost with diarrhea and vomiting. You can add a pinch of salt and half a teaspoon of honey or one teaspoon of sugar to an eight ounce glass of fruit juice. This will make your fluid replacement even easier to tolerate.  Avoid fizzy drinks and anything with alcohol or caffeine until you're feeling healthy.  Symptoms of dehydration include: dry mouth, thirst, tiredness, headache, dizziness, reduced urination and increased heartbeat.Children with diarrhea are more susceptible to dehydration than adults are.  Hydration is a really important part of managing mild diarrhea. If you can't intake all the hydration you need orally, you may need an IV to help replenish your fluids. If you think that you may need an IV, talk to your doctor as soon as possible.  You need energy to fight off the parasitic infection and to be able to go about your day, but the nausea and abdominal cramps from giardiasis can greatly diminish your appetite. As such, ease back into eating with small meals (or snacks) spaced throughout the day. Eat bland, low-fat and easy to digest foods, such as crackers, toast, soup broth, bananas and rice.Don't eat during waves of nausea.  Until you're feeling better, avoid fried foods, fatty and overly spicy foods. Avoid dairy products because you may have some degree of lactose intolerance that aggravates intestinal symptoms caused by giardiasis.  Don't eat too much fresh fruit or veggies (especially cauliflower, onions and cabbage), because it can lead to even more gas, bloating and abdominal cramping.  Snack on foods that can help your body get rid of parasites, such as pumpkin seeds, pomegranates, papaya, beets and carrots., There are a number of herbs that have anti-parasitic properties, which means they can inhibit the spread of parasites in your body or actually kill them outright. Effective examples include barberry, goldenseal, Oregon grape, anise seed, wormwood, curled mint and black walnuts.These anti-parasitic herbs are usually taken as tinctures under the tongue or diluted in some water. Taking them in capsules or using them to make herbal teas can work too.  Other herbs sometimes used to kill parasites include grapefruit seed extract, fresh cloves, olive leaf extract and garlic.  Some herbs used to treat intestinal parasites can interfere with certain medications, so use them only under the supervision of a qualified practitioner.  If the above-mentioned symptoms linger for more than a few weeks or get worse, then call your doctor or head to a walk-in clinic. While in a clinic or hospital, your doctor can confirm a diagnosis of giardiasis by taking a stool sample and looking under a microscope for parasitic spores.A stool antigen test and trichrome staining techniques are also available to diagnose Giardia.  As a rule, it takes 3 different stool samples to diagnose 90% of Giardia cases. Lab technicians look for a high concentration of either spores or trophozoites.  Staining might not be sufficient to identify Giardia because variable concentration levels can make people sick — some people are more sensitive to the parasite than others.  If your diarrhea is severe and you're unable to replenish your fluids at home, you may need to get treated at a clinic or hospital for dehydration. As such, if dehydration symptoms appear (see above), call your doctor and ask for advice on where to go. The best way to replace water and electrolytes (such as sodium, potassium and calcium) is intravenously, which requires a needle to be inserted into a vein in your arm.While you're on intravenous, you can also be given glucose and various essential vitamins, which can give you more energy and reduce your mental fog.  An intravenous session typically lasts a few hours, although you may need to stay overnight(s) if your dehydration and/or malnourishment is severe.  You may be given some oral rehydration solution to take home — they typically contain electrolytes and glucose dissolved in water.  Some antibiotics are effective for also killing parasites, so ask your doctor about getting prescribed one if your giardiasis lasts for much more than 2 weeks. Commonly prescribed antibiotics for giardiasis include metronidazole, tinidazole and nitazoxanide.Furazolidone and quinacrine are also effective for treating giardiasis, but no longer available in the U.S.The most common antibiotic used to combat giardiasis is metronidazole (Flagyl) — it has an efficacy rate of between 75-100%, but it often causes nausea and a metallic taste as side effects.Tinidazole (Tindamax) may work even better than metronidazole for giardiasis and it can be given in a single dose, but it also causes some side effects.  Nitazoxanide (Alinia) comes as a liquid and may be easier for children to swallow and tolerate.  Paromomycin and albendazole are less effective medications for giardiasis, but still sometimes used.  If your diarrhea persists for more than a few weeks, it's tempting to put a stop to it with medication, but your doctor may advise against it. Sometimes anti-diarrheal medicines can prolong the infection and make your condition worse because your body is prevented from getting rid of the parasite that's causing the diarrhea.Talk to your doctor about the pros and cons.  Over-the-counter anti-diarrheal medicines include loperamide (Imodium) and bismuth subsalicylate (Kaopectate, Pepto-Bismol). Bismuth subsalicylate can also be used to treat nausea and vomiting.  A stronger prescription anti-diarrheal is called Lomotil, although it must be taken as soon as you start experiencing diarrhea.  ","stay close to bathrooms. always wash your hands. rest as much as possible. keep well hydrated. eat small bland meals. try taking herbs that kill parasites. confirm a diagnosis. get treated for dehydration. ask your doctor about antibiotics. use anti-diarrheal medication cautiously.

"When you get ready to ask the guy out, have confidence in yourself. It may seem scary, but don’t let fear stop you from going through with it. Without confidence, you may end up giving in to insecurities. Remember, you are awesome and deserve nice things, so keep telling yourself that you can do this!Don’t be scared that the guy will not like it if you ask him out. Most guys today are okay with girls asking them out, and if they aren’t, they are probably not the guy for you!;  , When you ask him out, make sure you look nice, but not too nice. You don’t want to dress up in clothes you don’t normally wear to ask him out. Wear clothes similar to what you usually wear when you see him, and keep your makeup and hair like you normally do, too. Don’t try to do something different to impress him. Just be your normal, wonderful self!For example, don’t put on a dress, fake eyelashes, and tons of makeup if this isn’t what you normally wear. This may make you seem too intense or desperate.  When you ask him out on a date, make sure to keep it low stakes and casual. Remember, this is a first date and you are still getting to know this guy, just as he’s getting to know you. Keeping it casual can put you both at ease and helps you avoid looking desperate or too intense.Try asking him for a casual meal. Say, “Would you like to go get coffee?” or “Would you like to grab lunch with me?”  , When asking your guy out on a date, try to have a specific date in mind. Saying something like “We should hang out” or “Let’s do something sometime” is non-committal and may not lead anywhere. Instead, ask him out to a specific activity so it’s clear that you two will be on a date.For example, you may want to say, “Let’s grab a smoothie after the gym” or “Let’s go to trivia at the local pizza place tomorrow.”  , Taking the plunge around others, especially his friends, may result in a rejection, even if he is interested in you. Wait until the two of your are alone to ask him out.If he’s around his friends, wait until the two of you are apart from the group. Start talking to him casually so you don’t bombard him with the question out of the blue.  Taking the step to ask a guy out puts you in a vulnerable position. You have to be comfortable with hearing “no” because that is always a risk when asking someone out. If you can brush off a guy turning you down, ask out whichever guys you want.Some people cannot handle romantic rejection. If you think it will hurt you too much to hear “no,” then you may want to wait for him to ask you out.  ","be confident. look nice but casual. keep it low-key. be specific when suggesting a date. avoid asking him out in front of others. ask the guy out if you can handle a rejection. "
"Do you have a tendency to hog the limelight, to talk over others, or to insist that your needs are met first? Or, do you tend to think it's okay to throw a tantrum or sulk when things don't go your way? These sorts of behaviors suggest that you're being self-absorbed and expecting others to bend to your wishes.;  , This sort of focus tends to push aside others because you aren't willing to take into account their needs and wants, and you're unwilling to compromise so that everyone gets something they're after. If you can learn to spot that you're only interested in feeling good no matter how others are feeling, then consider that you may have a problem with being self absorbed.  Are they strained in any way? Are there too few such relationships to recall? What are the things you hear people saying about your behavior? The inability to have or maintain long-term friendships and relationships can be a warning signal that it's all about you and that you're not giving enough to others.  Realize that self-absorbed behavior tends to alienate other people. As social beings, all interactions are about give and take, not all take.  Self absorption is likely a defense mechanism born of a bad experience or series of bad experiences somewhere along the way. After being hurt by any sort of abuse or neglect, self absorption can be a reaction akin to self protection. It doesn't excuse continuing to do it but it does explain a tendency toward it. Thus, understand that it's a coping mechanism or self-protection and take care of yourself in the process of undoing it.  Another reason can be an early discovery that your physical appearance lets you get away with things, such as easily gaining friendships and popularity or getting other people to do things for you. When this sort of unearned power lands at your feet, especially as a young person, it can be hard to not let it go to your head unless you have good guidance from people who can spot this early and are in a position to also teach you humility and grace.  Looks fade, intelligence and skills last. Spend a lot of time honing your smarts and your skills and let your appearance simply be the icing on the cake. It may feel unrealistic to you now but in time, appearance changes and doesn't garner you the same, easy favors it once did. At that point, you must fall back on your wits, charm and ability. Thus, spending time cultivating these latter essences of self makes a lot of sense.  Avoid spending excessive time on your grooming and fashion. Don't take this to the opposite extreme though. Neglecting self-care is just as harmful as obsessive grooming, so don't sacrifice basic hygiene in order to seem less vain.  It can be hard to let go of the need to be first, to get the biggest slice of cake, to be heard before others and to feel less in control. But unlearning selfishness is a way of opening yourself up to greater opportunities in life, to experience more connections with others and to be happier.  Check out How to stop being selfish and How to be less selfish for some ways to help yourself.  Humility isn't innate. It's a self-taught skill that needs to be constantly nurtured and resorted to. It is part of undoing excessive self-concentration and opening you up to the reality that even with the best of skills in the world, an individual is not an island alone but shares all achievements with others. It also helps you to realize that you are connected to other people and that luck plays a part in life's success, not just one's own talents.  Read a book. Watch a movie. Appreciate the value of things that exist beyond your internal world.  In that way, you won't so tempted to avoid the hard work of self-change or to make the excuse that other people simply aren't good enough for you to be around.  Do you hear 'I' and 'I want' and 'I prefer' and 'My opinion is' and 'I think' coming from you all of the time? Use this deliberative awareness to begin changing the manner in which you converse with others, reducing these types of interjections gradually to 1 in 3, then 1 in 5 and so on. Substitute with such conversation as 'What do you think?', 'How do you do that?', 'Does it bother you?', 'Where did you get that?', 'How are you?', 'What are you working on right now?', and so on.  Work up to active listening. This is where you speak less, listen more and feed back to the speaker that you have genuinely heard what he or she has said.  When you encounter other people, address them by name. If you're self-absorbed, you're probably avoiding using the names of other people. By doing this, you are treating them as interchangeable props in your own personal drama (even if you don't think that this is what you're doing). Calling people by name will help you start to engage with them as living, breathing, unique individuals. It's a small step, but a crucial one.  And mean it too.

"Before you learn to do a roundoff back handspring, you should have the basic skills down or you won't be able to put it all together. More importantly, you risk injuring yourself if you try to do something that is above your skill and experience level. Here are the skills you should have down before you attempt the roundoff back handspring:  Roundoff  Back handspring  Handstand;  , Before you try the roundoff back handspring on the ground, you should use a running trampoline or the floor at your gymnastics gym. A trampoline and gymnastics floor are springy and more giving, and will allow you to gather more confidence and momentum than you would get from an ordinary floor.  It goes without saying that if you've never done a back handspring, you should try doing one with a spotter first until you feel really comfortable with it.  It's important to stretch your back, your wrists, your arms, your legs, and pretty much every part of your body before you attempt the roundoff back handspring. Though your wrists and back are the most prone to injury, you shouldn't neglect any part of your body when you warm up. Here are some stretches to try:  Stretch out your wrists by getting on your hands and knees with your palms down. Move forward and back a bit until you feel a deep stretch in your wrists. Then, turn your hands so that your fingers are pointed towards your body instead of away from it. When you're done stretching them, roll them in one direction and then the other.  Stretch your back by pushing up into a backbend and holding it for a few seconds. Then, come down and curl up in a ball on the floor, rolling up and down to roll out your back. This is a great counter stretch  to the backbend.  Stretch your hamstrings by standing on one foot, grabbing your other foot, and pulling your leg back until the back of your calf is on your thigh. Hold for a few seconds and repeat on your other leg.  Roll your head clockwise five times, and then roll it in the other direction, to release tension in your neck.  Before you do your roundoff, you'll want to run or lunge forward a bit so that your body gathers speed and momentum before you move into your roundoff. If you lunge forward, you should place your dominant foot forward. You can also just slightly lift the foot in the air in front of you and then plant it back down. Remember that you can do a standing roundoff, too. Running or lunging forward a bit can just help you gather some momentum.  Your arms should be raised over your head, so that your arms are up by your ears. You can lift your arms up at the same time as when you run or move forward. Your arms should be in this position pretty much throughout the roundoff — even when you're upside down.  Now, turn your body sideways and start lowering your upper body toward the ground while lifting your lower body in the air. You should move so that you plant the hand on the same side of your body as your dominant foot first.  Now, plant your hands on the ground, with the hand that is the same as your dominant foot landing slightly first. Once both hands are on the ground, you will essentially be doing a handstand, even though you don't have to hold it. In a handstand, your shoulders, arms, and wrists are all parallel, and you generate power from your palms and fingers as you push through your shoulders.  Your feet should be straight up in the air and parallel for an instant as they move toward the ground.  As you move out of the cartwheel toward your other side, focus on lowering your feet so you land on the ground with your feet together, while you lift your lower body up and finish with your hands over your head. You should land facing the opposite direction that you started from when you began the roundoff.  If it helps, you can think of the roundoff as just a cartwheel with your feet together.  As you finish your rebound, jump up as high as you can without jumping, keeping your arms up by your head. This will help you generate the momentum you need to move into your back handspring. Ideally, the roundoff back handspring will be one fluid motion, but you can start off by working on your roundoff, stopping, doing a back handspring, and then try to bring it all together.  After you complete the roundoff, you should use the momentum you generated from your rebound to sit back, as if you're going to sit in a chair behind you. You should position your knees over your feet for balance and to help generate enough momentum for you to jump backwards and land on your hands.  As you get in the sitting position, you should lift your arms high, so that they're directly up above your head, with your ears between your inner arms.  Once you get in the sitting position with those arms up high, you should melt your shoulders down and lower your arms to your sides. After that, you should swing them upwards as you continue to fall backwards, to help generate more momentum.  You should keep swinging your arms upwards until they reach over your head. As you do this, you'll need to push through your toes to get the upward mobility you need. Swing those arms up as high as they will go. The higher they go, the higher your body will follow. As you push through your toes, you should sink a bit lower into that imaginary chair. Don't worry if you feel like you're about to fall — that's part of the process. The idea is to get low before you fall backwards.  You can also tighten those shoulder and arm muscles to get ready to land on your arms. Your head should be between your arms, with your arms by your ears.  Try to maintain the same position between your head and your arms as you move backwards. It's important that you avoid arching your back too much. This is called undercutting, and it can injure your back. You also want to fall back a fair amount in a back handspring instead of landing close to where you started; not arching your back as much will carry you further backwards.  Use your legs to help drive you upward and backward.  Point your toes, extending through your ankles. Use all of the power in your legs.  As you move closer to the floor, you can start looking for a landing spot, or a place to plant your hands. It's important to keep your head in between your hands so they plant down before your head does.  As you fall backwards enough that your hands approach the floor, let your hands touch the floor while your body remains arched. Keep those arms nice and straight so your head doesn't hit the floor in the process. Your palms should be flat on the ground, with your fingers pointing away from your face. The momentum of your legs, with your lower body still following your upper body, should carry you over, so that your legs begin to approach a handstand position.  When your hands hit the floor, you should generate strength and stability from your palms and your fingers, not your wrists. You should also use your arms and shoulders for support. If you put too much pressure on your wrists, you will be likely to injure yourself.  This will briefly you put you in what is basically the handstand position. Though you won't be staying still on your hands and your legs will be continually moving, the basics of the motion are the same: your shoulders should be over your wrists, with your head looking down between your hands, while your legs are up in the air and relatively parallel. Since this position is essentially the handstand position, it's important for you to know how to do a handstand before you attempt the roundoff back handspring.  Keep your feet almost together with your toes pointed and the soles of your feet parallel to the ceiling.  Avoid locking your knees while keeping your legs almost straight.  Swing your legs and feet all the way over and snap them down firmly toward the floor. As you do this, you should keep your upper body as straight as it can be so that you land without losing balance. You should land with your legs slightly bent just a bit.  After all, it's called a back handspring because you 'spring' off of your hands to land on your feet. Think of yourself as a giant slinky, generating momentum.  The last thing you have to do to finish the back handspring is to plant your feet on the ground and then to pop your body up a bit by swinging your arms straight in front of you and then up. This will allow you to strike the finishing pose, with your arms raised up and your feet straight and just touching each other.  Chances are that you won't land the perfect roundoff back handspring right away. You may over rotate and land with your back on the ground, or you may not rotate enough to fully plant your hands on the ground. That's why practicing is so important — you'll eventually be able to find balance with your roundoff back handspring.  If you're not comfortable doing it on your own yet, then continue working with a spotter.  If you want extra support, you can use a trampoline or even a floor at a gymnastics gym, which will give you more spring and cushion than the ground.  ","make sure you have the basic skills down. practice on a trampoline or springy surface. stretch well. run or lunge forward. raise your arms above your head. turn your body sideways and move your hands toward the ground. plant your hands on the ground. land on your feet with your feet together. rebound as high as you can. get in a sitting position with your arms swinging upwards. push through your toes as you deepen your sitting position and raise your arms all the way up. continue to fall backwards with your arms still by your ears. plant your hands on the floor. swing your legs over your hands. plant your feet on the ground. pop up. keep practicing.

"Ensure that you have all the knowledge of relevant topics associated with that particular charity. The more facts you know the better you can answer any question that the person you approach may ask. For example: What is it all about?, Who benefits?, Why would anyone want to support that?, Will it improve my community?, will my efforts make a visible difference?;  , Ask the charity committee for any information they can spare (on paper).  This article would suggest that you approach schools, churches, local businesses etc. instead of just handing out flyer's in the street. As an example, arrange a meeting with the local school headmaster. Handing them all of the relevant documents proves that you are asking them to support a legitimate charitable organization. For example, the benefits coming out of the charity would be the goodness that could come to the community and how wonderful it would be to have that schools youth actively involved.  Recruit your friends and family. There are many ways to get people involved, the easiest is to convince your friends and family first. Focus on getting them actively involved.  Ensure that you are clear as to what type of support you are asking for. Remember that they will have to take the idea to others in a positive and exciting way.  The volunteers that sign up might have to be contacted later for additional information. This means that key information to record will include name & surname, contact number, age and description of what they volunteer to help with.  You will need to do a follow up meeting with your volunteers as soon as practically possible to give additional information, answer questions and relay what you will require of them.  Someone from the charity organisation will have to be available for people to contact if they have any questions. Ensuring that your volunteers can contact you in the event that they might have to cancel or if they have additional questions that need answering is very important.  If you are unable to answer a question accurately, direct them to someone who can. This article strongly suggest that the reader does not guess an answer to a question especially when it comes to distribution of funds and so on, as this might reflect badly on the organization of that charity.  If you keep the meetings with your volunteer fun, exciting and informative, you have less chance of disappointment on the day of the charity event with volunteers that just didn't show up or who is not enthusiastic about it.  After the event, keep the records of your volunteers and note what their responsibilities were at the time of the event. That way, you have a database for the next event. This means that the same volunteers could be reached if necessary preventing you from repeating 90% of your work, leaving you more time for other things.

"Pogs are cardboard discs about the size of a US half-dollar. They're usually blank on one side, with some kind of design on the other side. Slammers are metal discs that are somewhat larger than the pogs themselves. They were typically sold in big bins throughout the 90s, and can still be found in some kids stores, attics, and thrift shops.  The original pogs were the cardboard caps from bottles of POG, a popular juice in Hawaii. The game was played using bottle caps for a long time before it was commercialized for the mainland, where it became very popular in the 1990s.  If you want to make some pogs, trace a circle onto a piece of paper 4 centimeter (1.6 in) in diameter. Tape it onto a slab of cardboard. Cut the circle out and draw a design on the top using with black pen. Color if you want. To make the slammer, simply tape two pieces of cardboard together and flatten it.;  , Pogs is mostly a game of collecting the biggest and coolest collection of discs. A game of pogs requires a big pot of pogs, so it's usually played between a few friends all of whom have a big stack of them. The object of the game is to end up with your buddy's pogs in your stack, to make your collection grow.  Most games start with everyone comparing their favorite pogs in a pile. If you see some that you like, you can offer to trade for them or play for them.  Once you see some pogs that you like, you can challenge your buddy to a game to keep them, but only if you both agree. If you don't want to play for keeps, make sure you both know it.  Before the game, the players decide whether to play for 'keeps' or 'no-keeps'. If you play for 'keeps', a player keeps the pogs that are won, even if they are his opponents.  Back in the 90s, when playing with pogs was really popular, lots of schools outlawed the game. Teachers claimed that playing with pogs was a form of gambling. While its not super-common anymore, it's still good to make sure that it's allowed with your parents or teachers before you play.  Any hard flat surface will be fine to play pogs. Carpet, counter tops, and concrete are all good places for pogs. Just make sure you don't dent up your mom's table with your slammer.If you play on the concrete, sometimes it's good to put all the pogs on a book, or on a binder to keep your slammer from getting all dinged up.  Go around the circle, and takes turns putting in the pogs that you're going to play with. Just make a big pile of them facedown. Each player must put in the same number of pogs. It's usually best to play with at least 10-15 pogs total. Make sure the stack is at least that big.  Start by placing all the pogs into a pile, then shuffling them and stacking them face down. This helps to ensure that someone's pogs aren't all at the bottom.  If you're playing for keeps, remember that any pogs you put into the stack might not come back to you when you're done. You have to decide which pogs you're willing to risk to get the ones that you want.  Once you've shuffled them, arrange the pogs into a big stack. Make sure that all of the pogs are facedown, so you can't see the design side. The way you win the pogs is by flipping them over using your slammer, so it's important to make sure that they start facedown.  Once you've got your stack built up, start the game by flipping the slammer as you would a coin to see who goes first. The slam should pass in counter-clockwise order around the circle, after you find out who goes first.  The first player typically gets the most pogs out of the slam. It's a lot harder to flip over a very small stack of pogs.  Depending on who you play with, there may be a rule for how you're supposed to hold the slammer. In American Pog tournaments, it was required that the slammer be held between the index finger and the middle finger, and flicked downward, over the back of the wrist. But there are lots of ways to hold the slammer, so it's fun to experiment and see which is best. Here are some common techniques:  Hold the slammer flat against the inside of your fingers, and keep it in place with your thumb. Slap it down toward the stack.  Curl the slammer into your index finger and hold it with your thumb, like you were going to skip a stone.  Hold the slammer like you would a dart, between your index finger and thumb, sideways. Or turn it so the flat side is between your finger and thumb.  Take your slammer in whatever grip you've chosen, and forcefully slam it down onto the top of the stack of pogs. Let the slammer go as it makes contact. If you hit it correctly, many of the pogs should flip over onto the other side.  You collect all the pogs that you've flipped over. They now are yours, if you're playing for keeps. If you're not, just keep them in your pile until the game is over.  Restack the rest of the pogs that didn't flip over into a stack again, still facing down. Pass the slammer to the next player.  The game is over when one player has collected more than half the pogs from the stack. The remainder of the pogs go back to whoever put them in to begin with, and the winner keeps the pogs in his pile.  If you're not playing for keeps, return all the pogs to whoever started out with them in the first place.  The basic game of pog is pretty simple, but you can play a few little variations and specific rules to have more fun. Make up your own, or try some of these common classics:  Play best of 15. Some players play that the stack must always remain at 15, but it's not important who puts in more. If you really want to get your best friend's favorite pog, putting in 14 to his 1 might be a daring way to try to gamble for it.  Play the pogs where they fall. After the pogs scatter, pick up the ones you flipped, but don't restock them. Instead, play that you have to hit them where they fell. It's a lot harder.  Play long-range pogs. In some games, you're allowed to get right up on top of the stack before you slam them. In other games, you have to stand a few feet away, making it much more difficult to actually hit the stack. It adds a little fun to the game.  Just keep playing. One of the fun parts of the game is losing pogs, then getting them back, then losing them again. It's fun to keep playing for the same pogs over and over again. If you lost one of your favorites, it'll be easy to get it back in the next game.  The easiest way for players to collect a bigger stack of pogs is to play for them regularly. Challenge your friends to games with their collections and try to win as many games as possible to grow your collection quickly.  The best way to grow a bigger stack? Play with lots of people. If you play in a big group and everyone only puts in a few pogs, you don't stand to lose many, but you can gain a bunch pretty quickly. It's a fun way to play.  Got a pog you really love? Don't put it into a stack to play for it, if you don't want to lose it. The only sure way to keep the pogs you like is to keep them in your possession.  On the other hand, putting ones you really like into the stack helps to keep the game exciting. If you might lose your favorite, there are big stakes!  , Sometimes, people prefer trading pogs for pogs, instead of playing for them. Collecting them was often a more fun part of the game than actually playing the game. Like baseball cards, Pokemon cards, or other kinds of kids' trading cards, a good trade is half the fun.  Clear plastic storage containers were common for pogs back in the 90s. These were great for keeping your pogs new and clean looking, instead of all dinged up and dented. While these might be hard to find now, you could use PVC pipe of the appropriate size, a paper towel roll, or even just loose in a pencil case.  It used to be that you could just find pogs in big bins everywhere for a few cents each. Those were the days. Although pogs used to be widely available at toy stores, they're pretty uncommon nowadays. The best bet is probably Craigslist, or to find some in an older relative's attic if you want to score an old stash.

"To keep your space organized, start by focusing on your bedroom. Go through each item in your bedroom and determine if you can get rid of any items you no longer use or need. Reduce clutter in your bedroom and clean it out so you feel more organized and keep only items you use in your bedroom.For example, you may have a bookshelf in your bedroom that is stuffed full of books. Go through your books and put ones you no longer read or need in a box. Try to get rid of any books you honestly do not think you will read again. You can then donate the books in the box to charity so they are out of your room.;  , If you have a home office or a desk, tackle this area and keep it organized. Go through all papers and bills on your desk. Put these items in folders or in a filing cabinet. Get rid of any papers you do not need to keep as hard copies. Put office supplies in drawers or cabinets. Place pens and pencils in a pen holder.  You should also position items that you use often closer to your workspace so they are within reach. For example, if you often use a stapler in your office, keep it in the top drawer of your desk so it’s within reach and you know where it is at all times.  Organize electrical cords in your office by using zip ties to keep cords wrapped. This will prevent them from getting tangled and messy.  Your kitchen will likely be one of the most used areas in your home. Keep it organized by going through each item and donating any items you no longer use or are broken, such as broken kitchen tools or old utensils. Clear out these items and then assess the items you are keeping.  Place items together in drawers or cupboards, such as all coffee mugs together or all utensils together. Keep your kitchen counters free of items when possible and only leave out items you use often, such as a large cutting board or a kettle.  Some items need layout or ordering rather than just grouping. Frequently used unique items, like spices, should be kept handy and accessible, such as on a spice rack on the counter.  Perishable items, like food, should be consumed on a first-in, first-out basis. Load stacks of perishable items, such as canned food, starting with the oldest first in a cupboard or a pantry.  Another spot that tends to get messy is your closet, especially if you have a lot of clothing. Organize your closet by going through your clothing and getting rid of any items you no longer wear. Often, if you haven’t worn the item in one year, you can get rid of it. Group items of clothing together, such as all jeans on one shelf or all jackets hung in the same spot in your closet.  Rotate items that are within reach in your closet so you wear different items and get the most out of each item.  Keep all shoes together, preferably on a shoe rack or in labeled bins. This way you can view each pair and know exactly what you have in your closet.  To maintain your organization, do regular cleanings of your bedroom, your home office, your desk, your kitchen, and your closet. Designate one day a week as cleaning day and do a good clean of these spots. This will ensure you reduce any clutter that accumulates in each area of your home. It will also make it easier for you to maintain the system you have in place in each area to keep them organized.  You can also clean each space periodically throughout the week to maintain them. Do a light dusting of your home once a day. Throw out any papers or bills you don’t need right away, rather than let them clutter up your space.  It is good to clean your place every week. If you place become untidy very quickly, then you can use  , Get a calendar and hang it in a spot where you can look at it everyday, such as in your kitchen, by your bed, or in your home office. You can also put a calendar on your computer desktop or use the Calendar App on your iPhone. Put all important dates in the calendar, such as due dates, appointments, and meetings. Keep it updated regularly to help you organize your time.  Make it habit to check the calendar daily, such as first thing in the morning or before you go to bed at night.  Color code items in your calendar by priority. For example, you may highlight important dates in red and less important dates in yellow.  If you are using a Calendar App on your phone, you can set reminders days or a few hours in advance so you don’t forget an important date. You can also use other organizing Apps on your phone like 24me, Quip, and Wanderlust., A day planner is another great way to keep your time organized. It will break down the week by day, allowing you to put in appointments or meeting down for each day. It is especially useful if you have a lot of commitments throughout the day. Write down all of your commitments by hour in the day planner. Check the planner at the start of your day so you know what you have scheduled and can stay organized.  For example, you may write down a meeting in the morning, a phone call with a client in the afternoon, and a deadline in the evening.  To stay organized, make a to-do list. You may have one list for short term things you have to do and one list for long term things you have to do. Write the to-do list on a whiteboard and keep it somewhere you can see it, such as in your kitchen or your bedroom. Cross out items as you complete them so you feel productive and motivated to tackle more items on the list.  If you’d prefer to keep the to-do list on your computer, make a spreadsheet and use it as a to-do list. Keep the spreadsheet on your desktop so you can look at it and cross off items as you complete them.  For example, you may have a list of short term to-do items like complete assignment for tomorrow, clean room, and order supplies for the week. You can then keep a list of long term to-do items like apply for college in one month, learn Arabic, and plan a trip.  To help motivate you to stay organized, use a rewards system. You may treat yourself to a baked good or lunch at your favorite restaurant when you check an item off your to-do list. Or you may give yourself a five minute break and go for a walk if you complete the items in your calendar or day planner early.  You can also reward yourself with fun activities or relaxing activities, such as playing your favorite video game or watching your favorite show. Only give yourself these rewards when you have completed the necessary tasks for the day.  To stay organized while you work, create a daily schedule of tasks. List each task by importance and check them off as you complete them. Put the most important tasks first, followed by the least important. Doing this can help you feel organized on a daily basis, whether you are at work or at school.  For example, you may list tasks like completing an assignment or preparing lunch for your children first. Then, you may schedule in time to read emails or catch up on the news, followed by other tasks in the afternoon and evening.  Though it is important that you get all of the necessary tasks done, you should also set aside time for short breaks. You may schedule in five minute breaks after every few tasks so you can stretch your legs, go for a short walk, or do a few light exercises. You may also use the breaks to get coffee or a snack.  Having breaks will ensure you do not get too worn out or overworked, especially if you have a lot of tasks to complete for the day. If you are really busy, try to schedule at least one break in the day so you are not working too many hours straight.  Another way you can work in a more organized way is to multitask, where you switch between several tasks at once. Multitasking can allow you to get multiple things done within a short period of time. It can also help you be more organized, as you will feel less overwhelmed or stressed about the things you need to get done if you complete them all at once.  For example, you may put the kettle on for your tea and fold towels, send emails, and load the washing machine while the water boils. Or you may set a download on your computer at work and do paperwork or other tasks in the office while you wait for the download to finish.  Just keep in mind that some studies have shown that multitasking may diminish one's ability to focus on one thing at a time.  If you have a lot to get done, try to delegate tasks to others when you can. You may delegate tasks to workers in your office or to other family members in your home. Delegating tasks can make your day run more efficiently and allow you to stay organized.  For example, you may delegate chores in your home to your children or your family members so you are not the only one cleaning and maintaining the house. Or you may delegate tasks to coworkers who have free time or an hour to spare so you can ensure all your tasks get done for the day.

This could be during a shift change, right when the store opens, right before the store closes or during a busy rush.;  , They discriminate. Very young, or very old females are choice. As are new employees or shy employees. Basically someone that appears to be vulnerable.  They're charismatic and overly complimentary. They can be very agreeable for most of the interaction, this is to make you let your guard down and trust them. Scammers put a lot of thought into their appearance, they want to blend in, not stick out. They also want to appear powerful, so they may dress in expensive looking clothing. They might also try to prove their power or wealth by showing off. For instance, I once had a man show me his glasses frames and say 'I bought these for $1000'. No he didn't, because I've never seen a frame more expensive than $550 and those were Chanel. He also said they were Japanese, but they were actually German.  The deal starts off simple, but he/she makes a slight change... it's not too major but they complicate the process a little bit. Then he/she needs you to make another change, now things are getting too complicated but you're trying to be accommodating to this nice customer, who is about to spend a lot of money. The scam operators might even go so far as to spend a lot of money but then suddenly he/she wants a refund because he/she changed their mind, or you did something 'wrong'. What they're really trying to do is make your job so complicated and frustrating that they get you to a point where you just want to end this and give them what they want. Do NOT do it.  Say something like 'I'm gonna involve my general manager to make sure we can fully assist you' At that point you'll see the scam operators frustration and the bad guy should come out. This is where he/she is gonna make his/her final stand and see what he/she can get out of the manager. The scam operators thinks that the manager is going to try to appease them and save the sale buy taking a little hit and giving him/her something for free or give them a big break. Do not let that happen, make sure you walk away from the situation and clue in the manager that this is not an ordinary sale.

You don’t necessarily have to dance at these events, just observe what people are doing so that you can feel confident in the future.  This is the best way to figure out how to dress, how many friends to bring, and how to dance with and around strangers.

"An up-to-date list of cities that have Uber service is located at https://www.uber.com/cities/.  If you are travelling to a country where you plan to use Uber, make sure you have a payment method that works in that country. Credit cards are a popular way to pay for Uber, and many credit card companies will have no issue overseas. However, some cards may prevent international purchases, and that can hinder your ability to use Uber.  If you live in the US or Canada and have cellular service through T-Mobile, AT&T, or Bell and Rodgers, your phone is compatible with GSM networks.Other providers may also have phones that use GSM—call your carrier if you are not sure.  Some CDMA providers (like Sprint and Verizon) have a range of “world phones” that can be used on either CDMA or GSM networks.  If your phone is not GSM-compatible, you can still use the Uber app when you have access to Wi-Fi. This can be dangerous to rely on, as Wi-Fi networks are not always available.  If you have an unlocked GSM phone, get a local (to your destination country) phone number by purchasing a SIM card for use in that country. Not only will doing this save you roaming fees, but it will also ensure that your Uber driver can call if he cannot find you.  A few weeks in advance (if possible), call your carrier’s customer service phone number and ask if your phone is locked. If it’s not—great!  If the phone is locked, as the customer service agent to unlock it for international travel.The agent may offer you an international roaming plan as an alternative. These plans do not come with a local phone number in the company where you are traveling and cost far more money than you’re used to paying for calls, texts, and data.If you do decide that an international plan sounds right for you, you should still be able to use the Uber app to make your reservations.  If you’re staying in the country for less than a month, expect to pay anywhere from $15-40 for a SIM card and prepaid calling, SMS, and data credit.  If you have already arrived at your destination, head to a mobile, electronics or department store and view your options. Most stores will activate your new SIM card on the spot.You can buy a SIM card online in advance. This gives you the opportunity to do research before making your purchase. Popular international SIM providers like LycaMobile and Lebara make it easy to buy a SIM card and activate it online.  If you have not already done so, install Uber from the App Store (iPhone) or the Play Store (Android) and create your Uber rider account before you leave. This will give you time to test the app’s functions when you’re still in a familiar environment.  While tipping is not required, Uber drivers are permitted to accept cash tips if they are offered.  ","make sure uber is available in the city you are visiting. contact your credit card company to ask about international purchases. unlock your phone. buy a sim card and select a plan. download and install the uber app on your phone in advance.

"Garnet's hair post-Jailbreak is a bit smaller than it was before. A large wig will still do the job, though.  Sewing will be pretty much unavoidable with this version of Garnet. Buying a cosplay online might be your best bet if you can't sew and really want to cosplay this version.  Cut them both exactly down the middle and sew them together as one, with blue on the right and purple on the left. If you can, use the remaining fabric to sew the bottom half of Garnet's shirt; that way you won't have to worry about matching colors.  You'll need a pale pink or dark blue top as a base, then hot pink and red to create the star, which is at the lower left of the chest. The sleeves could be recreated with styrofoam.  Garnet has deep purple gloves, which stop at the wrist save for her third finger. Get a cheap pair of long gloves and cut them out in this pattern.  Shoes could be a bit of a challenge. You might want to buy shoes specifically for this cosplay or get subtly colored shoes that blend in with the leggings.  As always, Garnet has a great pair of shades in this incarnation. They cover her whole forehead along with her eyes and appear to have a pink and blue tint, but normal sunglasses are good nonetheless.

"Unless you know your floors are unwaxed, you'll need to test for wax in order to know how to best care for your flooring. Dampen a piece of extra fine steel wool and use it to rub areas you think might be waxed.Wax will show up as a light grey smudge or smear on the steel wool.  Floors that date prior to 1930 typically have many layers of paste wax over a tung oil finish or shellac. You can screen and re-wax the floor or use a chemical stripper to remove the wax and apply a modern polyurethane finish.  The easiest and gentlest way to restore an old floor to its former glory is to screen it with a buffer. After cleaning the floor, use a handheld sanding screen to roughen up the edges and corners of the room where the buffer can't access. Use a buffer with a 150- or 120-grit sanding disc to screen the floor, or buff down the existing finish.The sanding discs will wear out, so you'll need at least three to screen a typical room.  Once you've finished buffing, wipe down windowsills and other surfaces and vacuum the room thoroughly to remove all dust.Your choice of finish will depend on the results of your wax test.  For waxed floors, apply paste wax. If your floor was finished with a modern sealer, go with polyurethane. You can't use one if you started with the other: don't apply wax to a polyurethane finish or vice versa., If your floor is more than 50 years old, you should avoid sanding it. There's a limit to how much wood you can remove without permanently damaging the floor. When cleaning and reviving an old hardwood floor, sand only if it's so heavily stained that screening or chemical stripping aren't options., Get professional help if your old hardwood flooring is seriously worn or damaged, or if you're unsure about its composition. Word of mouth is typically the best way to find a good contractor. Look for one with restoration experience who won't advise you to simply rip out the entire floor unless absolutely necessary.For example, if your floor needs patching, you could have an experienced contractor remove flooring from a hidden spot, like a closet, and use it to replace a worn or damaged area.  ","test for wax. screen your floor with a buffer. refinish your floor. avoid sanding old hardwood floors unless absolutely necessary. consult a professional with restoration experience. "

"Skin specialists tell us that despite stories you may have heard about milk and chocolate, diet doesn’t directly cause acne. However, recent research examined diets of indigenous populations around the globe where there was no acne in the teenage subpopulations. When diets were compared between the controls in the US who had more than 70% acne and the indigenous teenagers without acne, it was clear that milk products in combination with too much sugar were missing in the diets of the acne free teenagers, but present in the US controls.This explains why for some people, certain foods including dairy products and diets high in processed sugars increase the risk for acne. These foods increase inflammation and provide an environment where bacteria can flourish.Studies have indicated that low glycemic index foods (GI) reduce the severity of acne.Low glycemic index foods are those foods that release sugars into your blood more slowly. The lowest GI foods are:Bran cereals, Natural Muesli, rolled oats  Whole wheat, pumpernickel, whole grain breads  Most vegetables except beetroots, pumpkin and parsnips  Nuts  Most fruit except watermelon and dates. Mango, banana, papaya, pineapple, raisins, and figs have medium GI.  Legumes  Yogurt  Whole grains are low- to- medium GI. The lowest GI are found in brown rice, barley, and whole grain pasta.  The vitamins that appear to be most important for the skin are vitamins A and D.Work the following foods into your diet:Vegetables: Sweet potato, spinach, carrots, pumpkin, broccoli, red peppers, summer squash  Fruit: Cantaloupe, mangoes, apricots  Legumes: Black-eyed peas  Meat and Fish: beef liver, herring, salmon  Fish: Cod liver oil, salmon, tuna  Dairy: Milk, yogurt, cheese  , Though many foods are fortified with Vitamin D, it doesn’t exist in abundance in the foods we eat. While you can try to increase your Vitamin D levels through eating, the single best way to get Vitamin D is to expose your skin to the sun 10-15 minutes a week. Sunlight triggers Vitamin D production by the skin.Do not wear sun screen, and leave as much skin exposed as you feel comfortable with.  Do not over-expose your skin to sunlight without sun screen, as it is very dangerous and could lead to cancer., Studies suggest that omega-3 fats can benefit those with acne.Omega-3 fats limiting the body’s production of leukotriene B4, which increases sebum production and leads to inflammatory acne. Sebum is a natural oil produced to moisturize the skin, but when it's over-produced, it clogs the skin and causes acne. By increasing the omega-3 fat in your diet, you can help control your acne. Foods you should look for include:  Seeds and Nuts: flaxseeds and flaxseed oil, chia seeds, butternuts, walnuts  Fish and Fish oils: salmon, sardines, mackerel, whitefish, shad  Herbs and Spices: basil, oregano, cloves, marjoram  Vegetables: spinach, sprouted radish seeds, chinese broccoli  ","eat foods with a low glycemic index (gi). fill out your diet with vitamins a and d. along with eating foods low in gi, you should also make sure that you're introducing the appropriate nutrients for skin health into your body. get vitamin d through sun exposure. increase your omega-3 fat consumption.

"If you're avoiding eggs for dietary reasons — and not just because your fridge is understocked — check the brownie mix ingredients first. Some brownie mixes contain whey or other dairy products not suitable for vegans. Less commonly, some brands include egg whites.  The easiest option is to follow the recipe printed on the box. For each egg in the recipe, replace it with one of the following:  1 tbsp (15 mL) finely ground flax seeds, mixed into 3 tbsp (45 mL) water and allowed to thicken for five minutes.¼ cup (60 mL) plain nonfat yogurt (or soy yogurt for a vegan recipe)An egg replacement product, available at health food stores  , Eggs are complex ingredients. While most egg substitutes can replace the moisture and the ability to hold the batter together, they do not form the same foaming structure that eggs do. Try adding ½ tsp (2.5 mL) baking powder to the mix to create a slightly airier batter and avoid a dense, collapsed brownie.  This is a ballpark figure, since brownie mixes come in many different recipes. You may need to experiment with adding more.  If you don't want to worry about all these egg substitutes, you can skip the recipe on the box and go with a two-ingredient recipe instead. Here are a couple options which may sound strange, but which end up working pretty well:  Open a can of black beans (~15 oz). Drain and rinse well to reduce salt, fill can with water, and blend until you don't see any bean skins. Mix with a box of brownie mix (~20 oz) and bake on a greased pan until a toothpick comes out mostly clean.Combine a can of pumpkin puree (~15 oz) with a box of brownie mix (~20 oz).

"Though you can start by asking how her day at school was, don’t stop there. It’s important for you to really talk with your daughter in order to understand her.  Begin the conversation with small, open ended questions such as, “Tell me about your day.” If your daughter doesn’t seem to be responding, let her know you’re there when she’s ready to talk.  If you start with broader questions, follow up with more narrow ones. For example, “How was your day?” “Did your chemistry test go well?” “How do you think you did?”  Try not to rapidly fire off questions though, as you don’t want her to shut down.  Remind her that it’s OK to discuss whatever’s on her mind and that she won’t be judged or criticized for it.Take advantage of talking with your daughter while you’re in the car together. You’ll both be less distracted, plus you can find inspiration for conversations based on what’s happening as you drive.  You can use the same method while you’re watching your favorite shows together. Instead of pre-recording the program, use the commercial breaks as an opportunity to chat.;  , One of the many advantages of talking with your teenage daughter is actually getting to know her. You’ll probably be surprised to learn how much her interests have changed since she was younger. Knowing her interests will help you to relate to her and bond with her.  If you notice, for example, that your daughter is into music ask her to tell you about some of the bands she’s interested in now. Tell her you’d like to listen to some of her favorite songs by that group. Even if you don’t like the music, refrain from expressing that.  If your daughter is into fashion, ask her to show you some of her favorite online stores. You can spend time looking at clothes together and can even plan a trip to the mall to visit more stores there.  One of the goals of getting to know your daughter is understanding what motivates her and what makes her happy. That means learning about her aspirations as well as her inspirations, so understand who your daughter looks up to, whether it’s a friend, older sibling or a celebrity.  Many teenagers depend on social media to make them happy. Discuss what social media sites she is on and what she hopes to achieve in using the sites.Keep the discussion from feeling like an inquisition by asking her about some of her favorite sites. You’ll probably be surprised to discover there are sites you have never even heard of.  For sites you’re unfamiliar with, ask your daughter to show you around. Learn how the site works and what the basic features are.  Ask your daughter about times where she had uncomfortable experiences online. Discuss what steps she takes to protect herself from unwanted attention, such as using privacy settings.  Online etiquette should also be discussed. Talk about what type of language is appropriate to use and what cyberbullying means. Most states have rules surrounding cyberbullying, so read up on your state laws prior to the discussion., Make sure that you discuss the dangers of drinking and doing drugs, without being overly preachy. Talk about some of the repercussions for using drugs and drinking alcohol as a minor.  Remember that her brain isn't great at processing risks right now, so help her out by explaining some of the negative consequences associated with drinking.  You may want to share some of your experiences to help her feel more at ease about opening up to you.  Even though you shouldn't ever encourage her to drink, let her know that you're always available to drive if she is in a bad situation.  Reiterate that she should never get into the car with a drunk driver and that you will come and get her, without fear of repercussions.

"If you're the old-school type who loves to balance their checkbook, more power to you! But know that emerging technology is making it easier than ever to track your expenses in real time, and with more sophisticated software. Mint.com, Quicken, and wallet.ai are all powerful online tools that will help you keep track of expenses and budget for the future.  Budgeting is like dieting. A lot of people start with majestic intentions. Then, when they fail to see results within two months, or when they start getting bored, they throw their hands up and quit, telling themselves it's not worth it. Don't give up before the battle has even started. Prepare yourself by acknowledging that budgets take a lot of time and a little effort.  Try to give yourself a full year of budgeting to determine whether it makes any difference in your finances. If, after a year of steady, scrupulous budgeting, it still hasn't made a dent in your savings or put a wad of cash in your pocket, feel free to re-evaluate. You won't be disappointed.  No, an emergency fund is not the same thing as your savings fund. An emergency fund is 6 to 12 months' worth of living expenses, frittered away for — you guessed it — an emergency. What if you lose your job? What if your daughter needs to go to the hospital? A host of emergencies can potentially burn a hole in your pocket. Being prepared is the best step, and one that makes a difference in your budget.  A tax refund, if you're entitled to it, can be a huge windfall. Imagine getting a thousand, or two thousand dollars, without really expecting it. Knowing how to spend this potential windfall, however, can be pretty tricky, especially if you're barely above water. Think about contributing to your emergency or savings fund instead of spending it on a new flat-screen TV.  According to AARP, American households hold an average of $8,400 in debt.That's a lot of cheese — a lot of cheese you owe somebody else. If you happen to pay off your debt each month with your income, that's great. But if you're like many other people, you might be struggling to pay off your debts each month, meaning that you have to attack things a little more strategically.  Which debts to you pay off first? High-interest debt or low interest-debt? Attacking low-interest debt and paying off certain debt lines altogether is called 'snowballing.' Attacking high-interest debt first is called 'avalanching.'If you're highly-motivated to pay off debts, go for avalanching. High-interest debts can gather up lots of compound interest fast, making this approach ultimately cheaper. If you need help motivating yourself, however, you might want to try snowballing, even if it means you'll pay more.  ","seek out technological help. don't give it all up at the first sign of failure. start contributing to an emergency fund. spend your tax refund wisely. pay off your debts slowly but surely. "

"Foods that can make your cat sick or die are:  Grapes  Chocolate  Onions  Garlic  Rotten food  Raw dough  Fish  Spices;  , Cats can eat chicken.  When feeding cats foods that are not meat, make sure you don't give them too much of it. It is still okay that they eat a little of the food.  You may feed your cat chicken or meat, but make sure you don't feed them this too much, or there are any other foods on it (such as pieces of onions). Feed them chicken that is not spicy and doesn't have any lemon or powder on it.  For example, if you were going to feed your cat a piece of chicken, look at the nutrition facts on another pack of the same chicken. If it is not healthy, you may not want to feed it to your cat.  Make sure you get a plate you don't use and won't use again. Otherwise, your cat will be licking/eating from the plate, and you may get sick if you eat from it after.

"If you want to record your gameplay on PC, you'll need to use a screen capture program. One of the most popular free options is Open Broadcast Software (OBS). This program is completely free and open source, and can record as well as most commercial programs. You can download OBS Multiplatform for Windows, Mac, and Linux at obsproject.com., The installer is very basic, and you can leave all of the settings at their defaults. As long as you downloaded the program from obsproject.com, you shouldn't have to worry about adware., You can find this by clicking the 'File' menu and selecting 'Settings,' or by clicking the 'Settings' button in the main window., This will allow you to adjust your basic video settings for your recordings. There are a few options that you'll want to take a look at:  Video Bitrate - This is the quality of the video. A higher bitrate will lead to a higher-quality image but lead to a larger file.  Recording Path - This is the location that recorded videos will be saved on your computer.  Recording Format - By default, this will be set to 'flv.' You may want to select 'mp4' for maximum compatibility.  This will allow you to assign specific keys to starting and stopping your recording. This will allow you to start recording while in the middle of a game., You can use single keys or combinations. Try to use a key that you won't be using in the game, such as one of the Function keys or a combination of Ctrl and another key., There are several things you might want to change before starting to record:Output (Scaled) Resolution - This is the resolution that your recorded video will be displayed in. A lower resolution will lead to a smaller file, but the quality will suffer. If you want the output to be the same as you see, set it to the same value as the Base (Canvas) Resolution.  Common FPS Values - This will lock the framerate of the video to the number you set (as long as your game can perform at that framerate). YouTube now supports 60 FPS video, so you may want to change this setting.  If you want to record your voice along with the gameplay, you can check and enable your microphone on this tab. You can also enable push-to-talk for your microphone so that you can record your voice when the key is held.  Close the Settings menu after checking your audio settings.

"It’s possible to gain membership to the Actors’ Equity Association as a nonunion actor. In order to do so, you’ll have to have established your reputation somewhat, as contract offers are typically made during negotiations with the theater. Try out for as many roles as you can to improve your chances of getting noticed by the right producers and theater managers.  Scoring an Equity contract can be tough, as most contracts tend to go to actors who are already Equity members.  You may have a better chance of being offered a contract if you’re working for a theater that participates in the Equity Membership Candidate (EMC) Program.  When discussing the terms of your employment with the theater where you’ll be performing, see whether they’d be willing to offer you an Equity contract at the end of the standard contract cycle.

"There are a lot of reasons why you mighty cheat on your partner, from unhappiness with your relationship to the thrill of romantic conquest. What is clear is that your current infidelity will severely cloud your judgment, and getting to the root of your wandering lust is essential for eliminating it. Your first step is always to put an end to whatever affair you're currently in, even if it is only temporary.  Remind yourself that this won't be easy, and that is okay. Just because stopping cheating is difficult doesn't mean it isn't worth doing.  The only way to stop cheating is to actually stop. Take things one day or date at a time and keep yourself busy.  Give yourself a manageable time limit, such as no cheating for two weeks. When it is over, ask yourself if the temptation passed with time or if it is still as alive as ever.;  , Take a vacation, or plan more dates and events with your partner and/or family. Pick up a new hobby all by yourself, giving yourself a safe outlet for alone time that doesn't involve infidelity. Whatever you do, don't replace your cheating time with more stress or work. Cheating, in some way, is a way to relieve stress and tension, so find a new way to relax. Fill the hours with something else you enjoy and the temptation to go cheat will get that much smaller.  People rarely cheat for nothing, and one of the most common causes is unhappiness with their current partner. Are they failing to fulfill your emotional or sexual needs? Do you feel like your cheating is a response to some form of their behavior? If so, taking a break from cheating is twice as important. When you don't have this outlet of the other partner, note if your perceived issues get worse or better. Are their fundamental problems between you two that only cheating seems to make feel better?  Cheating does not, in itself, mean you should leave or divorce your partner -- many couples actually come out of their affairs stronger than before. Cheating, however, always demands that you step back and re-examine the relationship.  While unhappiness with a partner is a big reason for cheating, some people cheat even when they're with 'perfect' partners. Perhaps you miss the thrill of chasing new dates or feel like you're missing the youthful feeling in a romantic life. Some people, feeling trapped at work or at home, like the feeling of control they get in their romantic life. The important thing to remember is that your partner doesn't have to be at fault for you to commit infidelity, and you need to know honestly if this is the case.  Know that well over half of all Americans have been to some form of counseling, and talking through these fears and worries with a professional is a good way to explore ways to fix them.  Are there things you can do in your personal life to become happier overall, such as reducing stress or your workload? This can help cut the desire to sleep around greatly., A good way to stop cheating is to stop making it about you and thinking more about your partner. It is much easier to let ourselves down, arguing to ourselves that our actions only hurt us and are thus deserved. But if you think about how your beloved is going to feel, assuming they will always find out (even if they don't), then you suddenly have something worth striving for.  If your partner found out you were cheating, then you should ask (constantly), what things you can do to regain their trust. It won't be easy, but it is possible., If you know there are issues in your relationship and are committed to fixing them, then it may be time tell your spouse that you have a problem. Marriage counseling, or just personal counseling, is a good way to get an objective, outside look at your issues. It can also be the best way to find solutions together.  If you've already been caught, but don't want the relationship to end, you have to show you're willing to work on the problems together. Don't just say 'I'm done cheating.' Find ways to show you're actively working on it., Cheating often exposes core issues in a relationship, but this is the first step to fixing them. It may be difficult in the short term, but cheating usually tells you where you need to work on your relationship together. Maybe your sex life has gone stale and needs an infusion of energy. Maybe you feel like you're carrying too much weight around the house, and this is the wake-up call that you need more help. Whatever the issue is, try to see infidelity as a chance to improve things instead of a sign that the partnership is already over., Is the short terms satisfaction worth the long-term consequences? Can a moment of passion make up for a month of guilt? You must honestly appraise the worst-case scenario of your actions. Ninety-nine times out of one-hundred a quick fling isn't worth your partner finding out and leaving you.  In the event of a divorce or separation, any infidelity can (and likely will) be used against you when allocating funds and child-raising obligations.  ","stop cheating for as long as you can while you figure things out. keep yourself too busy to cheat, finding other ways to blow off steam. examine your committed relationship for flaws and unhappiness. treat personal problems and desires seriously, even if they aren't your partner's 'fault.', put your spouse first when making amends or ending infidelity. consider coming clean to work on your issues together, potentially with marriage counseling. use infidelity as the motivation for a stronger relationship, not a broken one. recognize what you will be giving up by cheating.

"It is common to become depressed or lonely after a tough breakup or when you are having trouble meeting the right person. If you are feeling desperate it may be time to step back from dating. The longer your dry spell, the more desperate you might be feeling. Take a break from dating. Give yourself time to recover from the past and wait until you can be a good partner to someone again.;  , Even if these jokes are hilarious, they are a red flag that you are suffering from feelings of insecurity. Your self-deprecating jokes definitely aren't impressing anyone. While being a comedian is often a good trait to help you meet guys, it might not happen if you make yourself out to be the joke., This is one of the best ways to help shake that desperate feeling. Try making a list of all the things you want to accomplish that have nothing to do with relationships and work on making them happen.

"Using your tool belt is the most effective way to use the most common farming tools, such as a rake, seed dibber, and spade. Once you add something to your tool belt, it can not be removed.;  , There are several ways to do this, depending on the kind of seeds you want. Many mid to high leveled monsters drop higher seeds (for example herbs) while the lowest kinds (such as potatoes) can be gained from seed shops. Thieving master farmers or simply buying them at the Grand Exchange are always a great deal.  Know that most of the allotment patches are located on the outside perimeter of flower and herb patches. Special patches, wood trees, and fruit trees have their own locations around the RuneScape world.  , Using compost ensures a lower chance of your patch getting a disease (or dying). Super compost also ensures a higher harvest probability. When you apply the compost on a patch, the bucket will become empty in your inventory.

"There are several different types of thrillers. Choosing a type can help you determine the plot of the novel. The most common types of thrillers are:Psychological thriller: This type of thriller focuses on the psychological motives of the characters in your novel. Psychological thrillers usually include a main character who is mentally disturbed. (Ex. Family problems, the death of relatives, etc.  Mystery thriller: This type of thriller focuses on the solving of a mystery, but in a fast-paced, intense environment.(Theft, murder, suicide)  Science Fiction thriller: This type of thriller uses a lot of the themes and ideas in the science fiction genre. (Ex. Mutation, zombies, monsters, etc.)  Spy thriller: This type of thriller focuses on spies and espionage.(Ex: Assassination, elimination, kidnapping, etc.  Military thriller: This type of thriller is based on wars, whether real or fictional.(Ex: Wars, nuclear projectiles, hacking, etc.;  , A good thriller comes from a strong story idea. Most thrillers are built around a protagonist who falls victim to another character or has to fight against another character. Sit down and brainstorm story ideas for your novel that are specific to you and your perspective.For example, you may have a story idea about death and rebirth, where a character comes close to death and then reaffirms themselves. Or you may have a story with a hero who prevents a crime.  Another option is a story idea where a character prevents a disaster and improves society by solving a problem or dilemma.  Good thrillers will also have interesting, engaging characters to carry the story forward. Your protagonist or main character should be complex and have a detailed backstory, which is the history of a character or their past. Avoid using stock characters in your novel, as this can take all the energy out of the story and make it feel predictable for the reader.Avoid stock characters often found in thriller novels, like the hard-boiled detective, the cold, button-downed FBI agent, or the eager young reporter. Make your characters more complex and specific.  For example, you may have a detective that is blind and travels everywhere with a service dog, or an FBI agent who has a shady past and is eager to solve a difficult case. Think about different traits and qualities you can give your characters to make them unique and not a stereotype.  To get a better sense of the genre, read examples of thriller novels. Try to read a variety of different thrillers and different types of thrillers so you get a sense of what is being published. You may read:The Silence of the Lambs by Thomas Harris  The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo by Stieg Larsson  Rebecca by Daphne Du Maurier  The Talented Mr. Ripley by Patricia Highsmith  The Haunting of Hill House by Shirley Jackson  , To make writing the novel much easier, plot out your novel. Use a plot diagram to plot out the novel, making sure you keep the stakes high and the conflict going in the plot. A plot diagram will have exposition, the inciting incident, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution.  You can also use the snowflake method to plot out the novel. The snowflake method consists of a one-sentence summary, a one paragraph summary, character synopses, and a spreadsheet of scenes.  Start the thriller novel with a scene right in the action. Starting with action will throw the reader into the scene right away and assure them they are in for some major thrills. Introduce the crime or describe the protagonist in a the middle of a dilemma or major issue.Avoid including backstory or exposition in the opening pages of the novel. You can do this later. Start with the most interesting or engaging moments first.  For example, you may start a thriller with a description of a killer hunting down a victim. This will immerse the reader in the world of the story right away.  As the novel goes on, make sure the stakes are always high for the main character and for the reader. This means putting your main character in situations that are difficult or risky. Keep conflict going between characters. Create obstacles that get in the way of the character solving a crime or achieving what they want. Make the main character’s life full of complications or issues.For example, maybe you have a thriller where a young, eager FBI agent wants to solve a difficult case. You may make it difficult for the agent to achieve their goal by causing evidence to be lost in a fire or by having a witness go missing.  Do not include any unnecessary information or information that does not further the plot. Make sure the action moves forward continually in the novel and that the pace is always fast. Thriller are at their best when they are action packed and focus more on plot than anything else.For example, rather than include long sections of backstory for your main character, focus instead on getting the main character from scene to scene. Weave in backstory into a scene when necessary and keep the plot moving at all times.  Most good thrillers will have an exciting climax, often three-quarters of the way into the novel. The climax is the moment when the stakes are the highest and the story is at its highest point of suspense and tension. Your main character may confront the antagonist of the novel in the climax. They may solve the main problem or issue in the story. Or they may come to a realization that shifts or changes their world view.  For example, the climax of the novel may be the moment your main character unmasks the killer. Or it may be when the main character realizes the solution to a major issue or problem in the story.  Wrap up the novel on a high, suspenseful note. Rather than try to wrap up all the loose ends in the book, focus on ending on a scene that will keep the reader guessing. Show the main character making a decisive act in the last scene. Or have the main character come to a realization in the last scene that shows they have changed or shifted in the course of the novel.For example, you may have a long, elaborate foot chase at the end of the novel, with one last scene between the FBI agent and the killer.  Once you have completed the novel, read over the first draft. Read it out loud to yourself. Notice if the draft moves quickly and efficiently. Check if there are any plot holes. Look for any moments where you can sharpen or deepen your characters.  You can also get feedback from others on the draft to make it stronger. Show the draft to a writing group or to a writing mentor. Enroll in a thriller writing class and have the draft workshopped there.  You can also show the draft to friends and family for their perspective and advice. Be open to constructive criticism, as it will often make the novel stronger.  Once you have received feedback on the draft, revise it for action, suspense, and plot. Ask yourself, is this scene as suspenseful as it could be? Is there enough action in the novel as a whole? Does the plot make sense and keep readers on the edge of their seat?  ","choose a thriller type. brainstorm story ideas. develop engaging characters. read examples of thriller novels. plot out the novel. begin with a bang. maintain high stakes. keep the action moving. build to an exciting climax. end on a high note. read over the first draft. show the draft to others. revise the draft for action, suspense, and plot.

"Coordinating conjunctions serve as connections within a sentence. The coordinating conjunctions in English are For, And, Nor, But, Or, Yet, So., An independent clause is part of a sentence that has its own subject and verb. It can stand on its own as a sentence. You should always use a comma when a FANBOYS conjunction connects two independent clauses.  Here is an example of a FANBOYS conjunction connecting two independent clauses: “I checked out three books from the library, but now I find it impossible to read them all.” If you removed the conjunction, each clause would stand as its own sentence.  This conjunction does not connect two independent clauses: “Bai discovered he had everything he needed but a pencil.” The last part of the sentence cannot stand on its own.  The presence of a conjunction does not necessarily require a comma. Only independent clauses need to have the comma between them.For example, if your sentence joins only two words with a conjunction, do not use a comma: “Give me all the bacon and eggs you have.”  If your sentence uses “for” as a preposition to join a dependent clause, do not use a comma: “I’m saving money for a Hawaiian vacation.”  If your sentence uses “so” to emphasize another word, do not use a comma: “The teacher was so tired of grading bad essays.”  If your sentence uses “so” in the phrase “so that,” do not use a comma: “Elena knew that she should eat her breakfast so that she would not be hungry later.”  ","use fanboys to help you remember the coordinating conjunctions. use commas before coordinating conjunctions that link independent clauses. pay attention to the grammar of the sentence.

"Go online and request credit reports from each of the three credit bureaus (TransUnion, Equifax and Experian). Learning your credit score and seeing what positive and negative items are listed on your credit report will help you to see where you stand.  If you have a credit score of 680 or higher, you will most likely get the best interest rate loans available. Scores between 550 and 680 are considered sub-prime. If you have a sub-prime score, you may pay higher interest rates. If you have a credit score of 550 and below, it may be difficult to obtain a car loan. If your score is below 550, you may want to work on improving this score before trying to purchase a car., Double-check your credit report for accuracy. It is not unusual for these agencies to make mistakes. Sometimes improving your credit is as painless as disputing inaccuracies on your credit report.  If there are any small, unpaid balances on your credit report, pay these off. Paying off small amounts so that they are no longer listed as “unpaid” on your credit report can work to improve your credit rating, and display good faith to potential car lenders.Often, collection agencies will take a smaller settlement than what is owed, so try to negotiate.  About 30% of your credit score is determined by your 'debt utilization,' that is, how much of your available credit has been used. For example, if you have a credit card with a $15,000 limit, and you have only used $3000 of it, this will help your credit score. You can optimize your debt utilization by either paying down some of your balances, or increasing your credit limits.If you have recently gotten a raise or paid off some debts, you may by eligible for an increase in your credit limits. Contact your credit card company for details.  Being approved for a major credit card (like a Visa or Mastercard) can help your credit score improve. This may be difficult if you have bad credit, but you can work toward it by opening a less prestigious credit account and making all your payments on time. After a while, you can apply for that Visa or Mastercard again.

"For example, making a sehunthe(your choice here)root account right now is a fast way to get activity.  Instagram is a community, and you will find yourself gaining followers if you participate in that community. This means interacting beyond simply uploading photos. Find people that are posting pictures that interest you, and follow their accounts. This will let you see their latest photos on your feed.  Do a quick search for relevant hashtags on Instagram to get a list of photos and accounts that are similar to what you post. For example if you post lots of travel pictures then search for something like #instatravel  Don't just follow everyone you see, or your feed will become too overloaded to process. Limit yourself to following only those accounts that you find most interesting.  Instagram limits you to following about 120 people per hour.  Once you start following some people, take some time to like and leave positive comments on their photos. Not only will this make the other person feel good, but other people may see your name or comment and check out your profile. If you stay active, this can lead to a steady stream of new followers.  When commenting on photos take your time to write a longer message and use emojis when possible. It will be much more motivating for them to take the extra time to look over your profile.  Interacting with your own followers is essential to maintaining your follower base and building your community. Respond to any interesting comments, and thank your followers for any compliments. If a follower asks an intriguing question, take the time to answer it properly.  Use the photo caption to ask questions to your followers. This will get your comments section more active, which will attract more viewers to your photo.  Consider having a call-to-action, such as 'Double-tap if you found this funny' or 'Share your story in the comments'. This will help drive community interaction with your photos.  Instagram is now owned by Facebook, and you are losing out on a lot of potential followers if you don't connect your accounts. Once connected all of your Instagram posts will be pushed to Facebook as well, giving you double exposure.You can connect your accounts through the Instagram Settings menu.  Your Instagram bio is an often-overlooked but very important part of your Instagram account. Let people know who you are and why they should follow you. Include a couple hashtags as well that relate to your content.  Your bio is another good place to place a call-to-action.  Use multiple lines and emojis to draw attention to your bio.  Hashtags are words and short phrases that describe and categorize the image. Hashtags help people search for your image, and can add your image to current trends. Using hashtags is incredibly important to reaching a larger audience.Instagram is a great tool for finding what the most popular trending tags are.  The top hashtags on Instagram are usually #love #photooftheday #amazing #smile #look #picoftheday #food #instadaily #girl #iphoneonly #instagood #bestoftheday #instacool #instago #all_shots #webstagram #colorful #style #swag  You can find relevant tags using websites such as www.tagsforlikes.com or download apps on your phone by searching for 'tags for likes' on the app store.  Add a few of the most pertinent hashtags you can find to your image. Try to limit the number of hashtags to three at the most. If you have too many hashtags, your followers will feel like your images are too spammy. Hide away the hashtags by using them withing the caption sentence e.g. 'I really #love this #girl' or place them right at the bottom of the caption.  Instagram will limit you to a maximum of 30 hashtags per post.  If you have a decent amount of followers, you can try creating your own hashtags. This could be your company name or a slogan that applies to many of your photos. This will help brand your Instagram account, and lead to a more cohesive community presence. Use this tag in all your photos you post as well as in your Instagram accounts bio.  You can use capital letters to seperate words in a hashtag rather than spaces. Instead of 'Just do it' you could use #JustDoIt  , Instagram users are interested in photos from locations that they know. On top of that, as you post geotagged photos, Instagram will bring up other photos from that location.  Other users posting photos from the same location may see your pictures and follow them to your account, giving you more exposure and potentially new local followers.  Avoid geotagging your photo in a location that the photo was not taken. Incorrect geotagging could lead to negative comments on your posts or other forms of backlash.  For your own safety avoid geotagging your home or work locations. Remember these geotags are visible to the public.  If you want to try to bolster your likes, comments, or followers you can use some of the more popular like, comment, or follow trading hashtags, such as #follow4follow #like4like #comment4comment #f4f #l4l #c4c #followback #likeback #commentback #teamfollowback #alwaysfollowback etc. Just make sure that you actually hold up your part of the deal and like, comment, or follow the user back.  Some people consider this a 'dirty' tactic, and you may lose some followers if you tag this too often.  While this tactic may lead to new followers, be aware that they may only follow you to gain more likes on their own photos rather than out of genuine interest.  Make sure you follow though with your side of the deal to avoid any nasty comments or unfollows.  While this may seem obvious, one of the best ways to get followers on Instagram is to simply take good pictures. Instagram is swamped with pictures of people's meals and cats, so set yourself apart with well-shot photos.  Try to take pictures that will relate with your target audience. If your audience can connect with the images that you take, they are more likely to follow you.  A good photo doesn't have to be a 'perfect' photo. Good photos seem human and imperfections can help add to that feeling.  Limit 'selfies'. Everyone likes to post a selfie every now and then, but you shouldn't let these pictures dominate your content. Most followers don't want to see you, they want to see your photos. Posting constant selfies can come across as narcissistic, and can drive followers away. The exception to this, sad as it may be, is if you are attractive. You can get a lot of followers by posting attractive pictures of yourself. Even then, don't let it dominate your content!  , Instagram got popular because of the filter options. These filters adjust the color of your photo, giving it a more 'real' feel. Instagram has a variety of filters available, so don't be afraid to try multiple ones until you find one that works well with your photo.  Avoid using the same filters over and over, or your images will start to feel too same.  If the picture is striking enough without a filter, a popular hashtag on Instagram is #nofilter. Use it!  if you are struggling to find a good filter then try a third party photo editor like Google Photos which has many different filters that are not available on Instagram.  A good caption can turn an okay photo into an amazing one. Captions help grab the viewers' attention, and if you can make them laugh or smile with your caption you'll retain more people as followers. Jokes or cute captions are especially popular.  While you can do some minor editing in Instagram, there are a variety of apps for both iOS and Android that can give you way more tools. Use these apps to brighten, darken, crop, add text and effects, and much more.  Popular editing apps include Photo Editor by Aviary, Afterlight, Bokehful, and Overgram.  A great way to show progression or a collection of images is to create a collage to post on Instagram. There are several apps that will allow you to do this, including PicStitch, InstaCollage, InstaPicFrame, and even Instagrams own collage app named Layout.  Instagram is an incredibly popular service, and your followers' feeds are likely updating constantly. If you want the most people possible to see your photos, you need to post them at the right time. The best time to post photos is during the morning and after normal work hours end for your audience.Instagram photos typically last around 4 hours in a person's feed, so avoid posting in the middle of the night or your followers may never actually see the image.  You can find the best times to post pictures for your audience by using websites such as IconoSquare  , Don't dump all of your photos into your feed at once. If you have multiple photos that you want to share, spread them out over a couple days. If you post too many pictures at once, your followers are likely to start skipping over them. On the other hand, if you don't post often enough, you will have difficulty maintaining followers and drawing in new ones.  There are lots of websites that offer followers for money. If you're desperate for more followers, purchasing some may help get your Instagram account off the ground.  Make sure to read reviews of the services before settling on one.  Find a seller that accepts PayPal.  Check for a money back guarantee.  Carefully read the Terms and Conditions as well as any Privacy Policy.  Most services allow you to choose from a variety of packages, ranging from 100 to 1 million followers. Choose the package that best suits your needs and budget.  You cannot purchase followers for a private account because private accounts hide the amount of followers they have, so ensure that you set your account to be publicly visible. You can change the settings from your Profile page by tapping 'Edit your Profile'.  Buying followers can give you a quick boost, but there are some drawbacks. These followers will likely never interact with your photos and leave comments, which can leave your photos a little bare. People will also notice when you have lots of followers and no activity, which can turn them away. These followers may also unfollow you after some time.

"This way, Santa will be blessed by seeing a nice place and won't trip over anything.;  , Before Santa Claus (aka Father Christmas) arrives, make sure you hang up your Christmas stockings over the fireplace or at the end of your bed, ready to be filled with fun sized gifts.  Sliding down millions of chimneys and delivering presents all over the world in one night can be very tiring. Santa Claus needs to keep his sugar levels up. Leave out a few cookies by the Christmas tree to give him that extra burst of energy he needs to make it round the rest of those homes on Christmas night.  It can be thirsty work too, so ask an adult to pour Santa a glass of milk and have it waiting for him. He'll be very grateful for this drink on a cold winter's night.  Of course, it's not just Santa who has work to do on Christmas Eve. In fact, the hardest part of the job is done for him by his magical reindeer. Leave them a few carrots to munch on. They'll provide Rudolph and the rest with some much needed energy as they fly around the globe, making sure the big man gets where he needs to be, when he needs to be there.  Whatever you do, you must make sure that you are tucked up in bed before Santa arrives. He will only visit your house once you are asleep. And don't think you can outsmart him by pretending. He can always spot a faker. The sooner you go to bed, the sooner it'll be Christmas.

"The first step to perfect skin is to figure out a skincare routine that works for you. Everybody's skin is unique, so what works for another person may not work for you. Take a long, hard look at your skin and decide whether it's normal, sensitive, dry, combination, blemish-prone or oily.  If you have normal skin, you're lucky! Your skin doesn't get oily, your pores are small, your skin tone looks even and you rarely suffer from breakouts.  Sensitive skin tend to be very reactive - it may become dry, itchy or irritated depending on the weather, your lifestyle and the products you use.  Dry skin usually feels tight after cleansing and can suffer from roughness or flakiness, especially when exposed to cold weather or dry air.  Combination skin means that your skin can be dry and oily. It might be flaky and rough around the edges, but oily along the t-zone.  Blemish-prone skin is just that - prone to blackheads, pimples and excess oil. Even though you try to keep it clean, it still suffers from breakouts.  Oily skin can become greasy and shiny-looking within an hour after washing. The oil may even seep through your make up and cause it to slide off.  In addition, whether you have a light skin tone, medium skin tone or dark skin tone will also dictate what issues your skin is prone to, and should be taken into consideration when choosing skincare products.;  , Washing your face is super important as it cleans away dirt, oil, bacteria and traces of make-up that would otherwise be left sitting on your skin.  However, many people believe that the more they wash their face, the better - but this is a mistake. Overwashing is just as bad as not washing at all, it dries out the skin and can make it red and irritable.  Stick to washing your face twice a day - once in the morning to cleanse any oil that has built up overnight, and once in the evening to remove any dirt and make-up from the day.  Use a cleanser that is suited to your skin type (it should be stated clearly on the bottle). When possible, try to avoid using cleansers that are scented, colored, or full of chemicals, as these can be irritating on your skin, or just ineffective. When it comes to choosing products for your face - the simpler the better.  To cleanse your face, splash your face with warm water. Hot water can be too harsh and drying on your skin, but warm water is perfect as it opens the pores. Squirt some of the cleanser into your hands and use your fingers to work it into your face using gentle, circular motions.  Then rinse your face with cold water (to close the pores) , making sure that you get all of the product off. Use a clean towel to gently pat your face dry (rubbing is too rough on your skin). Or - even better - allow your face to dry naturally.  Toner is the most overlooked product in skincare, and the step that many women skip. And while it's not absolutely necessary in your skincare routine, toning has many benefits.  Firstly, toner helps to remove any remaining dirt, make-up or dead skin cells that your cleanser leaves behind, leaving your skin squeaky clean. Secondly, toner helps to restore the skin's PH balance to its ideal, slightly acidic level. Thirdly, toner leaves skin slightly damp, which enables it to better absorb any products (like moisturizers, serums and sunscreens) that you apply afterwards.  Toners are also a great way of adding certain active ingredients to your skincare routine. What these active ingredients are will depend entirely on your skin type. People with blemish-prone skin will benefit from toners containing beta and alpha hydroxy acids which exfoliate the skin, people with dry skin should opt for moisturizing toners containing vitamin E or aloe vera, and people looking for anti-aging benefits should look for toners containing anti-oxidents (to repair the skin) and retinoids (to combat wrinkles). However, it's important to note that people with dry or sensitive skin should avoid using alcohol-based toners as these can be too harsh and drying.Most toners come in liquid form and are very easy to use. Simply squirt a little of the toner onto a clean cotton pad and gently swipe over the face and neck. Leave the toner on the skin, there's no need to wipe off.  No matter what your skin type, moisturizing is one of the most important steps in any skincare routine. Moisturizers hydrate the skin by holding water in the outermost layer of the skin. They also protect the skin and improve skin tone and texture. However, like with other skincare products, the moisturizer you choose will vary greatly depending on your skin type.  People with normal skin should opt for a water-based moisturizer which will not upset the skin's balance. The moisturizer should feel lightweight and non-greasy on your skin. Moisturizers for normal skin usually contain lightweight oils such as cetyl alcohol and cyclomethicone.  People with dry skin need a heavier moisturizer for deep hydration. As a result, moisturizers for dry skin are usually oil-based, which is better for locking moisture into the skin. Look for particularly hydrating ingredients such as grape seed oil and dimethicone (a type of silicone oil).  Oily and blemish-prone skin still needs to be moisturized, especially if you tend to use drying cleansers and toners. Look for very lightweight, water-based formulas, and choose products that are labeled 'non-comedogenic' which means that they won't clog pores.  Sensitive skin requires a very simple moisturizer that won't irritate the skin. Avoid colored or scented moisturizers and steer clear from any products which contain acids. Instead, look for soothing ingredients like aloe vera, chamomile and cucumber.  Aging skin tends to dry out easily, so look for a richer, oil or petroleum based moisturizer. You should also look for added benefits of ingredients like antioxidants, retinoids and alpha hydroxy acids to plump out the skin and minimize wrinkles., Regular exfoliation sloughs off dead skin cells and leaves skin fresh, smooth and glowing. That's why it's important to exfoliate at least once a week, or more (depending on your skin type).  However - many people make the mistake of believing that exfoliation means scrubbing skin to within an inch of its life. This is untrue and can actual be harmful to your skin, as intense scrubbing or rough exfoliators can cause micro-tears in the skin.Skin (especially the skin on your face) is sensitive and requires a little more love and care than people tend to give it. Therefore, if you decide to purchase an exfoliating product, choose one with small beads, not large granules.  Alternatively, you can buy cleansers with exfoliating ingredients like alpha hydroxy acids which remove dead skin cells without the need to scrub. Or you can simply use a clean, damp washcloth to gently rub your face - this works as well as any product and is pretty cost effective!  Another option is to invest in a cleansing and exfoliating tool such as the Clarisonic, which has a rotating brush for thoroughly cleansing the face and cleaning out pores. Many people who use Clarisonic brushes swear by them, but with their hefty price tag (from $100 to $225) they are not an option for everybody.  A final exfoliation option includes making your own face scrub at home. This is so easy to do and can produce results as good as any store-bought scrubs, while ensuring that you expose your face to only natural products. Try mixing brown sugar and olive oil, baking soda and water, or any other homemade face scrub ingredients!  , It may sound like the simplest thing in the world, but you should never underestimate the importance of completely removing your make-up every single night. It's a pain, and there will definitely be nights when it's the last thing you'll feel like doing, but your skin will thank you for it!  If make up is left on the skin overnight it can clog the pores, while also denying skin the opportunity to repair itself from the stresses of the day. This opens the door to blackheads, breakouts, excess oil and all manner of undesirable issues!  In addition, make up can trap free radicals that your skin is exposed to during the day. If your skin is not cleansed properly at night, these free radicals remain on the skin. This is not good, as free radicals break down collagen in the skin, leading to fine lines and wrinkles.Although the full cleanse, tone, moisturize routine is preferable, in case of emergencies you should keep a pack of cleansing wipes beside your bed, along with some eye make up remover pads. Then you just need to give your face a quick wipe to remove the bulk of the make-up before your head hits the pillow.  On the subject of make up...if possible, you should try to give your skin a break and go bare-faced every once in a while, especially if you tend to wear heavy foundation. This may seem scary, but your skin will feel much better for it. If going completely naked sounds too extreme, consider switching to a tinted moisturizer - it's much lighter than foundation but will still provide some coverage.  And finally, you should make sure to go through your make-up bag at least every six months and throw away any products that have been hanging around for a while. Make up is a haven for bacteria, so using lumpy foundation and gunky mascara can lead to clogged pores and breakouts.  Last but certainly not least, if there's one change you should make to your skincare routine after reading this article it's to wear an SPF everyday. The importance of wearing sunscreen cannot be understated.  Sunscreen protects your skin from harmful UVA and UVB rays which contribute to a whole plethora of skin issues. For one, sunscreen has been proven to significantly reduce the risk of developing skin cancer - which is reason enough to wear protection in itself.  Secondly, sunscreen protects against the effects of aging. In fact, sunlight is one of the major culprits behind skin issues such as fine lines, wrinkles, brown spots, red veins and discoloration. By consistently wearing sun cream, you can slow down these signs of aging and preserve your skin's youthful appearance.  You should look for sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30, especially if you're fair-skinned and have red or blonde hair. Many daily moisturizers and foundations come with an SPF already included, which helps to simplify your morning routine.  Remember to wear sunscreen everyday, not just over the summer or when it's sunny. UV rays are just as strong when the weather is cold and can even penetrate cloud and rain. You can provide further sun protection by wearing sunglasses and a fashionable hat, when necessary.  Never use old or expired sunscreen. It's protective benefits have essentially worn away, so it will not prevent burns or skin damage. In addition, the formulation of sunscreen often changes once it expires and can cause skin irritation and itching., Acne is one of the of the most stubborn and irritating skin problems out there. Although it primarily affects teenagers, it can last well into adulthood and no one is immune to the odd pimple here and there. Since acne is such a widespread problem, there are many treatments available and with a little trial and error you can find one that works for you.  Follow the normal skincare routine of cleansing, toning and moisturizing, but be sure to use products designed especially for acne-prone skin. Try using cleansers containing ingredients such as triclosan, benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid. Use a lightweight, oil-free moisturizer to combat any dryness.  In addition to the normal skincare routine, it often helps to use a medicated spot treatment, which usually come in cream or ointment form. Some of the most effective treatments include ingredients such as benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, sulfur, retinoids and azelaic acid. Although most of these topical treatment creams are available over-the-counter, some stronger concentrations may require a prescription.  If spot treatments alone don't seem to be working, make an appointment with a dermatologist. They can prescribe an array of medications - topical and oral - depending on the type and severity of your acne. Some people respond to oral anti-biotics, some women find that going on the pill helps, and others require more intense retinoid treatments, such as accutane.  Fine lines, wrinkles, sagging and brown spots are all skin care issues that everybody will have to deal with at some point in their lives. However, with the right care and protection it's possible to stave off these issues and keep your skin looking young for as long as possible.  Firstly, it's important that you follow a skin care regimen using products designed for older skin. These products are richer and therefore more hydrating, which is important as older skin tends to become dried out and papery.  To combat wrinkles and saggy skin, look for moisturizing creams or lotions containing antioxidants. Antioxidants neutralize free radicals - which destroy skin cells and contribute to signs of aging. Some common ingredients that contain antioxidants include tea extracts, retinol ( a vitamin A compound) and kinetin (a plant compound that is believed to increase collagen in the skin).To deal with brown spots and sun damage, look for products that contain beta and alpha hydroxy acids as these exfoliate the skin, removing the dead, discolored layers and revealing the fresher, smoother skin underneath.  However, if you're looking for one magic, cure-all product for lines and wrinkles, there's only one product that stands up to the task - Retin-A. Retin-A - known generically as tretinoin or retinoic acid - is an acidic form of vitamin A which is extremely effective at reducing wrinkles, firming saggy skin and lightening discolorations, which it does by increasing cell turnover, stimulating collagen production and exfoliating the skin. Retin-A is only available with a prescription, so speak to your dermatologist if you're interested in starting this treatment, or read more information here., Discoloration includes problems such as brown spots, dark patches and hyperpigmentation.  These problems are caused by the overproduction of melanin in your skin, which can be triggered by a vast array of things such as sun exposure, pregnancy, menopause, birth control pills, other medications and picking at blemishes. Although discoloration will sometimes fade on its own, there are many treatments and creams that can help speed the process along.  The first step in the treatment of discoloration is to pick up a selection of skincare products containing retinoids and use them on a daily basic. Vitamin A derived retinoids exfoliate the skin to remove the discolored top layers of skin and replace them with fresh, new skin. Skin should improve over a matter of months. If you want a more fast-acting treatment, get a prescription for a cream or gel containing retinoic acid, which produces the same results but it significantly stronger.  If you're looking for more of a bleaching treatment (to lighten dark patches or melasma), hydroquinone is an effective option. Hydroquinone lightens the skin by inhibiting melanin production. The 2% formula is available over-the-counter, but you will need a doctor to prescribe the stronger 4% formula. Before using this treatment it is important to be aware that hydroquinone has been banned in large parts of Asia and Europe due to its potential carcinogenic properties.If cost is not an issue, you could also look into getting laser or light treatments, chemical peels or microdermabrasion. Speak to your dermatologist to figure out which is the best option for you.  And finally, the most important thing to remember when dealing with discoloration is to always wear sunscreen. Sunscreen can prevent UV light from triggering melanin production and making the discoloration worse.  Having sensitive skin can be a pain - you need to be so careful about the products you use and how you treat your skin, otherwise you could end up with issues such as excessive dryness or redness, stinging sensations, red bumps or even pustules.  Having sensitive skin also makes you more prone to developing skin conditions such as eczema, rosacea, acne and contact dermatitis. However, if you can learn to have a little patience and make informed decisions about your skincare, sensitive skin is entirely manageable.  As mentioned before, when buying products for sensitive skin it is important to avoid cleanser, moisturizers and other products which contain colors or fragrances, as these products are much more likely to produce an undesirable reaction. When choosing, try to go for the simplest products possible - look for cleansers and creams with ten ingredients or less.  You will also need to avoid products containing ingredients such as antibacterial agents, alcohol, retinoids or alpha hydroxy acids. Even though these substances may be beneficial for other skin types, on sensitive skin they will merely cause dryness and irritation.  Instead, look for products that containing soothing and anti-inflammatory ingredients such as chamomile, white tea, aloe, calendula, oats and marine plants.  If there is a particular product you want to use, but you're unsure of how your skin will react, then it's a good idea to do a patch test first. Start by taking a small amount of product and rubbing it on the skin behind the ear. Do this for five nights in a row, and if no irritation occurs, try applying it to a small patch of skin beside your eye. Repeat the process and if there are no signs of irritation, it should be safe to apply the product to your entire face.  In terms of make up, look for silicone-based foundation as this is the least likely to cause a reaction. Stick with pencil eyeliners and brow fillers, as their liquid counterparts tend to contain latex, which is a common allergen. Don't use waterproof mascara, as it requires a special type of cleanser to remove which is too harsh for sensitive skin., Make sure you follow a healthy diet, enriched with the vitamins and minerals your skin needs.Vitamins B, C, E, A and K all help keep your skin fresh and glowing.  Vitamin B forms the basis of skin, hair and nails. You can find this vitamin in foods like oatmeal, eggs, rice, bananas and even Vegemite.  Vitamin C protects your skin against sun exposure, keeping you away from skin cancer. Vitamin C pops up in citrus foods such as lemons, limes, oranges, bell peppers, cranberry/grape juice, cauliflower, and leafy greens.  Vitamin E also helps protect your skin against sun exposure, and can be found in foods such as olives, spinach, nuts, seeds and vegetable oils.  Vitamin A is essential for repair of the skin tissue-without it your skin will look dry and flaky. Vitamin A is found in fruits and veggies-so load up.  Vitamin K helps reduce dark circles under eyes, as well as bruises. Vitamin K is hidden away in leafy green vegetables, dairy products, and meats such as pork and liver.  As you probably know, drinking water is important for clear, healthy skin. This is due to the fact that your skin - like most other cells in the body - is composed primarily of water.  Without enough water, your skin can become dehydrated and look dry, tight and flaky. Over time, this can lead to the appearance of wrinkles.  Drinking water also helps to eliminate harmful toxins from the body, which would otherwise build-up and wreak havoc on your skin and overall well-being.Although there's no exact scientific measurement of how much water you should be drinking a day (it varies from person to person and according to climate and physical activity) a good base would be 6 to 8 glasses.  If drinking water isn't your thing, you can substitute by drinking plenty of green or herbal tea, or coconut water (which is said to be extra good for your skin). Alternatively you can add a slice of lemon to your drink to give it some flavour. Lemons are also extremely beneficial to the skin so you'll be killing two birds with one stone!  You should also try to eat lots of fruits and vegetables with a high water content, such as tomatoes, cucumbers, watermelon, grapes, iceberg lettuce, celery and radishes.  Sleep is essential for healthy, fresh-looking skin - they don't call it beauty sleep for nothing! As you sleep, your skin repairs and renews itself, replacing old cells with new ones.  When you don't get enough good-quality sleep, your skin can look dull, pale and sagging the next day. This is partly due to the fact that your blood doesn't circulate as well when your tired. Lack of sleep also causes blood vessels under your skin to dilate, which leads to dark circles beneath the eyes.  So for fresh, healthy looking skin you should aim to get 7 to 8 hours sleep a night. You should also try to wake up and go to bed at the same time every day, as your body likes routine. Avoid smoking or drinking alcohol before bed, as this affects the quality of your sleep.  Aside from the sleep itself, you can make some adjustments to your sleeping conditions which will benefit your skin. For example, it's better to sleep on your back than on your front, as your face is not pressed up against the pillow (which can contribute to wrinkles).  You should also change your pillowcase at least once a week to avoid the build-up of oils, dirt and bacteria, and opt for white sheets instead of colored ones, as the dyes can irritate sensitive skin., Exercise not only keeps you in shape, but it helps your skin maintain a fresh and healthy glow by regulating the flow of oxygen to the skin.  Be sure to avoid wearing make-up when you exercise. Sweat and dirt will get trapped in your pores and cause you to break-out.  Avoid leaving sweat on your face after you work-out. Take a shower or at least thoroughly cleanse your face as soon after exercise as possible.  Stress is bad for your skin on every level - it can contribute to excess oil, breakouts, redness, sensitivity and wrinkles. It can also aggravate skin conditions such as rosacea and eczema.  In terms of your body's chemistry, stress causes an increase in the hormone cortisol, which triggers oil production and leads to acne fare-ups. It also causes blood vessels to dilate which causes redness.  On a physical level, constantly furrowing your brow and frowning causes a loss of collagen and can lead to premature wrinkles.Therefore, by reducing your stress levels you can improve the quality of your skin. You can do this by making time for yourself and doing things you enjoy - like going for a walk, taking a yoga class or just spending time with your loved ones.  Smoking is bad for your skin. Period. If you want to improve the appearance of your skin and prevent early signs of aging, then cigarettes should be the first thing to go.  Smoking is bad for your skin in many ways. Firstly, cigarettes contain carbon monoxide, which limits the amount of oxygen that gets to the skin, and nicotine, which reduces blood flow. These two factors can leave skin looking dull, grey and dry.  Secondly, smoking disrupts the body's absorption of nutrients such as vitamin C, which is necessary for the skin to repair and renew itself.  Smoker's tend to have more fine lines and wrinkles than their non-smoking counterparts, as smoking causes accelerated aging due to reduced blood flow to the skin.Giving up smoking is not the easiest thing in the world, but with some determination and support from your friends and family it is possible.

"Some people like straight walkways, while others like to get a little fancier with the design and use different bricks or sizes.;  , Garden hoses are long and flexible, making it easy to make changes.  Make certain the walkway is straight, unless you have the talent necessary to cut the bricks to fit a curved design.  You'll want to mark each side of the walkway with stakes.  Tie colored string from stake to stake, making straight lines to use as a guide when digging.  Follow the walkway and dig down into the ground about 8 inches (20.3 cm).  The depth of your walkway must be consistent for the entire walkway.  This type of shovel works great for digging through tough soil and grass.  While the walkway needs to be level, the ground should slope gently outward from the brick walkway to act as a runoff route for rain and snow.  Be certain you evenly spread the gravel over your walkway.  These stay in the ground and act as permanent support for your bricks. Your bricks should fit within the forms, which are flexible enough to compensate for any curves in your walkway border.  , This works great under your bricks and acts like concrete once you water it and allow it to dry.  Check your walkway every few feet with a level to be certain you are maintaining the proper height and curve.

"When faced with a bigger opponent, you're going to be at a disadvantage from the start. Unless there's truly no other option, try to defuse or avoid physical violence at all costs. Do your best to make peace or simply walk away, if you can. There is no shame in running from a fight, especially if you don't know how it will turn out. Your opponent may be carrying a concealed weapon, or have friends lying in wait to gang up on you. Your primary goal should be getting yourself out of harm's way.Getting away from a violent situation before it erupts should be considered a victory.  If a fight becomes unavoidable, stay relaxed. When you panic, your ability to gauge your surroundings and employ effective strategies shuts down.;  , Keep your hands up to defend your head at all times. Your forearms should be held vertical and parallel, with palms turned inward toward your cheeks. Squeeze your fists together lightly until you’re ready to throw a counterpunch. Hunch slightly to bring your elbows down closer to your midsection to protect your ribs and abdomen from body blows.Don’t allow your guard to fall or get lax, even when you’re tired. Dropping your guard leaves you wide open for that one good shot which could mean the end of the fight.  Make sure you assume a guard from which you can quickly and comfortably deliver punches or elbow strikes.  An aggressor who is bigger than you is also likely to be stronger, so it’s not recommended that you try to stop his attacks directly. Instead, stay mobile to swiftly escape from his punching range. Making him chase you will exhaust him, and with every missed attack he’ll lose a little more steam. If there’s no chance of getting a safe distance away, slide your head to the outside of the punch so that it passes by harmlessly, then immediately rush in and hit back.Evading is always preferable to blocking because it doesn’t require you to absorb force with any part of the body.  Dodging a punch using only head movement is known in boxing as a “slip.” Slipping punches is an excellent way to avoid being hit while expending minimal energy., The bigger, stronger person always has the edge in a grappling match. Don’t put yourself in unnecessary danger by allowing your opponent to take hold of you. Keep just outside his reach until the time comes to counter, then capitalize and pull away again. If the fight goes to the ground, you’re looking at a scenario where you have even less control, as your speed, evasiveness and precision will go right out the window.If one of you takes the other down, or you happen to trip, get back to your feet as quickly as you can. You have a much better chance of outclassing a large opponent in a stand-up encounter., It’s unlikely that you’ll walk away from a fight with a larger opponent unscathed. You may have to eat a few punches if you get caught off guard or while you’re trying to find a way to slip inside. Keep this in mind and ready yourself mentally. Getting hit is no fun, but it could end up being much worse if you let it take you by surprise.If you do have to take a hit, try to do it on the shoulder or forehead, which is a harder, less vulnerable surface than the jaw or the rest of the face. Let your body sway in the direction of the punch to lessen its impact.During a physical altercation, your body will be flushed with adrenaline, which can keep you from feeling as much pain.  Move constantly to keep the larger opponent from grabbing you or landing strikes. Stay light and poised on the balls of your feet so that you can change directions quickly and keep him guessing. Since his reach is longer than yours, stay safely outside of it until you’re ready to move in and counter with a strike or takedown of your own.One method you could employ is to “dance,” or move in a circular motion around your opponent while staying outside of his striking range. When you sense a punch coming, duck, dodge make sure you’re too far away for it to connect.Since the legs are longer than the arms, becoming proficient at kicking can help overcome your opponent's reach advantage.  Whatever you do, don’t let a larger opponent get their hands on you. One wrong move could end the fight in their favor.  When your opponent is least prepared, close the distance between you and move in close. This will neutralize his superior size and reach and put him in the right range to land some hard shots of your own. Finding the right timing and approach for getting in close is paramount for emerging victorious—you cannot win a fight with a bigger attacker by playing into his strengths.When negotiating range with a bigger opponent, the most important thing to remember is to stay out of the “danger zone.” This is the range at which he can hit you but you can’t hit him back due to his added reach.  Move in suddenly after dodging a blow or feinting one of your own, or follow your opponent’s punching arm back as he retracts it.  One of the downsides of being taller and heavier is that it takes more effort to move, and as a result you run out of energy faster. Use this to your advantage. Keep slipping, dodging and moving constantly until your opponent begins to slow down. At that point, you can use your speed to slip into close range and unleash some punishing offense of your own.Working out to improve your cardiovascular conditioning can prepare you in the event that you need to be able to outlast an opponent’s onslaught during a fight.  The strategy of allowing an adversary to tire themselves out before finishing them off has become known as the “rope-a-dope” principle. Muhammad Ali used this gameplan to win a championship bout with the larger George Foreman at the Rumble in the Jungle in 1974., If you suspect things are about to take a nasty turn, be the one to make the first move. End a tense standoff with a sudden, well-placed blow to the jaw or solar plexus (the soft, fleshy outer edge of the diaphragm beneath the sternum). Put everything you’ve got into the strike—try to put a stop to the fight in a single maneuver. If you’re successful, your opponent will be incapacitated and the altercation will be over. If not, you’ll at least already be ready for the ensuing brawl.Assess the situation as best you can before resorting to a surprise attack. In many cases, the aggressor might simply be worked up and won’t have any intention of actually getting into a physical dispute. Be certain that you’ve exhausted all other options first.  Be careful when going for a sucker punch. If it misses or doesn’t do the trick, there will be no way to avoid a full-on fight.  It’s worth repeating that you shouldn’t try to stand and duke it out with a bigger guy. His reach and power will just be too much to handle. Take your time staying away from his strikes, waiting for an opening and then closing the gap and landing a hard shot. By alternating between defensive posturing and quick offensive bursts, you’ll eventually be able to wear him down.Don’t get impatient. You’ll start making mistakes, which could end up costing you dearly.  Attack the body when you don't have a clear shot at your opponent's head. The solar plexus is a sensitive target that when hit just right can drive all the air out of an opponent's lungs and leave them gasping for breath. The ribs are also quite fragile, and can be broken with only a few pounds of force per square inch.  Unlike a boxing match, which has regulations about where you’re allowed to hit an opponent, all bets are off in a real fight. Target the most delicate areas of your attacker’s body to make every strike count. One well-placed blow is all you'll need to put your towering opponent out of commission. Most people won’t be expecting these types of attacks, so they’ll be left without a ready defense.Everybody has the same anatomical weakness, despite size differences.  Strikes that target an opponent’s sensory organs will leave them temporarily stunned, enabling you to get away or follow up with a hard hit.  An open hand slap to the ear is just as good as a left hook for shattering an opponent’s equilibrium, if not better. Hitting the nose can blind them momentarily by causing their eyes to well up with tears, which gives you an opportunity to throw a fight-ending punch. A kick to the groin will compromise their mobility and instantly take the will to fight out of them.  Let’s say you get taken down with your opponent on top of you, and you’re unable to climb to your feet. In this situation, scramble for a submission technique, a hold or lock that incapacitates an attacker by neutralizing a single part of the body. By applying a joint lock, armbar or choke, you may be able to do enough damage to put an end to the scuffle. No matter how big or tough someone is, they won’t be able to hurt you if they’re unconscious or have a broken arm.Apply a rear naked choke or triangle choke, depending on your positioning. Chokes disrupt an opponent's circulation or ability to breathe, causing unconsciousness. It only takes a firm hold and a few moments to put an opponent to sleep.Armbars are holds that apply pressure to the elbow joint or shoulder. They are effective against attackers who leave their arms extended momentarily after throwing a punch. As a bonus, disabling an arm means they can’t hit you anymore., Forget about honor or fairness: there are no rules on the street. You don’t know how badly you might be injured if you come out on the losing end of a fight, so you shouldn’t be discouraged from being vicious. Bite, gouge eyes, pull hair, chop the throat, bend fingers back, knee the groin and do anything else you have to do to survive.Turn objects around you, such as bottles, chairs, rocks, pens or even your cell phone into improvised weapons. In the best case scenario, the sight of you holding a weapon may be enough to make your attacker back down.To avoid escalating the violence further, make a run for it as soon as you have your opponent reeling.  ","don't fight unless you have to. keep your guard up. dodge strikes rather than blocking them. don’t wrestle with your opponent. be prepared to take a punch. use evasive tactics. get in close. tire them out. use the element of surprise. stick and move. aim for sensitive targets. go for submissions on the ground. don’t be afraid to fight dirty.

"Helmet itch can be caused by a variety of things. While some causes may be due to your helmet or helmet lining, your itchy scalp may be due to a medical condition, such as contact dermatitis or even lice or ringworm. You'll wan to check with your doctor if you have an on-going issue with helmet itch so that you can be properly diagnosed. Other things can also cause helmet itch, from static to hair length to hair products.  The causes of helmet itch may be due to potential issues with your scalp rather than the helmet. If this is the case, simply cleaning your helmet may not alleviate helmet itch.  When you are trying to figure out the cause of helmet itch, try different tactics until one works. Even though one issue may be solved, another may be the one causing helmet itch.  This is a condition in which your skin is exposed to an irritating foreign substance or an allergen, leading to itching, redness, and discomfort. You may be reacting to the material in your helmet or possibly a chemical used to treat the inside of your helmet. Make an appointment to see your doctor for a proper diagnosis., Your itchy scalp may be caused by more than just sweat or irritation — you may have dermatophytosis, or ringworm, which is a fungal infection of the skin (don't worry, there's no actual 'worm' in ringworm). Ringworm commonly affects the scalp and can cause itching. Look also for raised, red, scaly patches; patches that resemble a ring; blisters that begin to ooze.See your doctor for a diagnosis of ringworm. If ringworm is confirmed, then your doctor can prescribe you medication and discuss treatment.  If you have a ringworm infection, you will need to thoroughly clean your helmet, as you could reinfect yourself. Discuss this with your doctor.  Another common cause of an itchy scalp is a lice infestation. Lice are parasites whose bites can cause itching. If you have lice, you may notice a tickling sensation on your scalp; red, itchy bumps; difficulty sleeping; or tiny white objects in your hair, which are lice eggs, or nits.Get someone to check your hair for lice or visit your doctor for diagnosis and treatment. You'll need to thoroughly disinfect your helmet (as well as your bedding, clothes, and other items that might harbor lice) to ensure you don't become reinfested.  In most cases, helmet itch caused by static occurs pretty quickly after putting on the helmet. If static is the issue, you can try to wet your hair and scalp before putting on your helmet.  For helmet itch caused by static, the best tactic is to have wet hair when putting on your helmet. Wet hair is heavier and is less inclined to produce static electricity.Static electricity can also be dangerous. If you are riding a motorcycle, static electricity could potentially spark a fire when you're filling up your bike., Hair length can be a factor and may also contribute to increased itchiness. If you have long hair, you’re more likely to experience moderate to severe itch more frequently, since your helmet will be more humid.  If your hair is especially long, it may be a good idea to braid it or put it in a bun. This can keep your hair out of your face, but also keep it isolated to avoid helmet itch.Very short hair can also cause itchiness. If you have very short hair, try wearing a protecting covering to keep your hair protected from the helmet., If possible, avoid using hair products that dry out your hair, which can cause scalp irritation when placed on the skin. These products can be especially itchy in humid conditions.  Switching to hair products that moisturize your hair can help prevent itchy scalp. In particular, try to avoid products that contain sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) since these can dry out your scalp.Additionally, eating healthy fats such as nuts and avocado can provide your hair with plenty of natural oils. These can make your hair less dry and make you less prone to itchy scalp.  ","identify the underlying cause of helmet itch. consider that it may be contact dermatitis. check for ringworm. check for lice. consider static as the cause of helmet itch. think about the length of your hair. note the hair products you are using.

"Read books and learn all you can about dementia so you better understand what you are dealing with. There are a wide range of products available to help make both the dementia patient and the caregivers life easier.;  , People with dementia are for the most part caring, smart, funny and always wanting to help others. They respond to kindness and they need a lot of patience.  Sometimes people with dementia become anxious or angry. At these times diversion is most important. They like to be kept busy with games, crafts, singing, or just talking about the past. Their abilities will be different because the stage of their dementia is different.  It will be hard for a mate not to grieve the loss of his/her mate of many years, or for the child not to grieve the loss of a loving parent. Attend support groups and seminars, and know you are not alone.  For those who are caring for relatives suffering with dementia, there are a range of dementia products and dementia aids designed to make both carer and patients' lives easier.

"Breastfeeding twins is a big task, but not an impossible one. It is a life transition that, even though it is temporary, is worth gathering support for. Find a local gathering of breastfeeding moms to get encouragement for the days when it is hard to persevere through breastfeeding. Finding other moms who have breastfed twins is also a good idea.  Don’t forget to talk to a lactation consultant if you get discouraged or have a question. You may have met a lactation consultant when you were in the hospital giving birth. You can also talk to other moms in order to find a good one in your area.  Your pediatrician can also provide support and resources for you.  Setting goals for breastfeeding twins will help you stick to it on days when you feel overwhelmed. For example, you could decide to breastfeed for six months and then switch to formula.  You could also set up a feeding once a week or more where your partner feeds the babies pumped breast milk while you take a break.  Making the transition to breastfeeding twins can take a few weeks, especially if you have other children. It is wise to get help with your household chores until you have an established breastfeeding routine so that you don’t get overwhelmed.  In order to continue to produce a good milk supply, and to stay motivated to breastfeed, you must take care of your body. For the first few weeks of your twins’ lives, you are also recovering from giving birth (unless of course you have adopted), so you need to make sure your body heals properly.  Drink a lot of water, eat a balanced diet heavy in lean protein, and rest when your babies sleep.  Eating foods heavy in calcium, vitamin D, iron, and folic acid can help both your milk and your body.  Get as much rest as you can. If necessary, ask loved ones to take care of the babies so that you can get the rest that you need.  At some point, once breastfeeding is firmly established, you may want to consider something called “combined feeding”—a combination of breastmilk and formula. This can be helpful in giving you more free time or allowing you to go back to work during the day. Babies also tend to start consuming a high volume of milk as their sucking reflexes strengthen, so adding formula can give your body a break.Breastmilk is the best nutrition for a newborn baby, and making the decision to breastfeed twins is commendable because of how much time it takes, especially in the beginning.Some twins, especially if they are born prematurely, may need special formulas or supplements in addition to breast feeding. However, most babies can still have at least some breast milk, even if they do need supplements to their diet.

"You can peel as much or as little away as you want. Lay's claims they only do a 'gentle peel,' which leaves a bit of skin on some of the edges., If you have a mandolin, this will be much easier to do. Set the mandolin to a medium thickness and get slicing. If you are using a knife, slice as thinly as you can without endangering yourself. Aim for regularity over your top thinness -- if they are roughly the same thickness, they will all cook at the same rate.  Baked chips must be a bit thicker than their fried counterparts, so you don't need to go as thin as you possibly can.  This step is necessary to pre-cook the starches, which allows you to bake the chips later and get them nice and crisp. If possible, use a metal strainer or sifter to boil the potatoes in, which you can carefully lift out with tongs once they chips have finished boiling, letting all the water drain away., You want a nice high cooking temperature to really crisp the edges. This is why your pre-boil -- the potatoes are already cooked when they go in the oven, allowing the high heat to simply crisp them up.  Add the oil slowly, mixing the whole time, so that you only use enough for a thin coating on all the potatoes. Add the salt generously.  Do not layer the chips -- they should not be touching each other as they cook. The parchment paper will prevent sticking, which can cause your chips to rip as you remove them later.  You can flip them once, at about the 7-minute mark, to ensure that they cook equally.

"There are many natural, over-the-counter creams people use to reduce the appearance of stretch marks. These can be used throughout pregnancy and beyond to keep the skin supple and fade stretch marks. There is no conclusive research showing that any one ingredient can fade stretch marks. However, the following natural products are said to be helpful:  Aloe vera, which is said to reduce scarring and stretch marksCoconut oil or butter, which keeps skin supple when applied dailyShea butter, used around the world to help fade stretch marksEgg oil (Oleova) helps prevent stretch marks when applied twice daily over the entire abdomen from the first trimester of pregnancy until six months after delivery.;  , Hyaluronic acid is a substance naturally found in the body. When applied topically, it has the effect of reducing the signs of aging, such as fine lines and wrinkles. There is no research proving that hyaluronic acid drastically changes the appearance of stretch marks. However, some have found that treating stretch marks a gel containing hyaluronic acid may help to to fade them.Gels containing hyaluronic acid may be ordered online or purchased in specialty beauty stores.  Apply the gel according to the manufacturer's instructions., Retinoid is a substance that is known to stimulate collagen growth in the skin. When applied to stretch marks, it may help renew the skin and cause the stretch marks to fade in appearance. Retinoid cream is available by prescription. Talk with your dermatologist about whether it's a good choice for your skin.Retinoids may take weeks or month to have a significant effect on the skin. Even after that much time, they are unlikely to completely erase your stretch marks.Retinoids should not be used while you're pregnant or breastfeeding. There is not enough research to determine whether retinoids have a negative effect on a developing fetus or newborn. Physicians advise avoiding retinoids until after you've given birth and are no longer breastfeeding., Microdermabrasion is the process of removing the top layer of skin cells using a small exfoliating tool. Since stretch marks affect more than just the top layer of cells, many do not find that the treatment makes a significant difference. However, some believe that microdermabrasion can help fade the appearance of red stretch marks.Talk with your dermatologist before choosing dermabrasion. He or she may be able to advise you as to whether it's a good choice for your stretch marks.  Dermabrasion treatments are normally conducted at salons or spas. These treatments usually cost between $100 and $150 for one session.  There is no conclusive research showing that laser therapy works to remove stretch marks, but many women have had satisfactory results.A high-energy ultraviolet laser is used to remove the thin layers of skin around the stretch marks. After the treatment, the skin is renewed and the stretch marks are faded in appearance.If you're interested in laser therapy, talk with your dermatologist about the risks before proceeding. In some cases, laser therapy causes scarring.  The healing process after laser therapy usually lasts about one week.

"While you may think it's best to focus on your abs, it's actually better to do exercises that work your whole body. That's because these exercises help you lose weight all across your body, which in turn takes fat off your belly. They also help strengthen your stomach muscles.For an exercise that works your whole body, try swimming, running, or walking., Many cities have adult community leagues for sports. Alternatively, your workplace may have a baseball or soccer team. Joining a team gets you active even when you're just having fun., While working your abs by doing crunches and sit-ups can help your overall health, it's not going to flatten your stomach on its own. That's because exercising increases muscle in the areas you work, but it draws fat from your whole body. Therefore, while crunches and sit-ups can be a good workout, you can't focus only on them to flatten your stomach.If your main goal is to lose belly fat, then it's fine to stick solely with aerobic exercise.You should be getting at least 150 minutes of aerobic exercise a week.If you want to add in abdominal work, you can add 10 to 20 minutes to your routine.  If you're like many people, you may eat when you're bored. Instead of reaching for a snack, go on a walk instead. Exercising instead of eating will help cut down on the fat in your body.

"You might find it easiest to choose the fabric you want to frame first. After you've settled on one, look for a frame that coordinates well with the color and style of the fabric.  You have various options to work with when selecting the fabric you want to frame. For something easy to work with, a fabric with a continuous, symmetrical pattern is a good choice. For something bolder and more eye-catching, look for larger prints.  Home decorator fabric works especially well due to its dimensions and weight, but you can choose lighter fabrics, as well. You will need anywhere from 1/4 to 1/2 yard (22.86 to 45.72 cm) of fabric.  The frame should also be the right size to adequately showcase the pattern of the fabric.  If you have an elaborate print, consider using a simpler frame so that the print becomes the focal point. In contrast, if you have a simpler or smaller print, try spicing it up with a decorative or vintage frame.;  , Remove the glass and place the frame over the fabric with both the frame and the fabric facing right-side-up. Move the frame around until you figure out the best portion of the fabric to frame.  You might want to consider wearing gloves when you remove the glass to protect your hands from any sharp edges.  Note that this step is much easier if you have a continuous, symmetrical pattern since there will not be much variation no matter where you place the frame. If you chose a fabric with a larger print, though, you might have to play around with it for a while before you find a composition that appeals to your aesthetic sense.  After figuring out the portion of fabric you want to frame, make sure that this portion is wrinkle-free. Use an iron to remove any creases or wrinkles.  Alternatively, you could iron the entire piece of fabric before choosing your composition. Ironing it after you make your selection allows you to focus your efforts on one specific patch of fabric, though, thereby saving time.  Make sure that you pay attention to the make of the fabric before you iron it. Heavier fabrics need a stronger heat setting while light or delicate fabrics need very low heat, if they can tolerate heated ironing at all.  With the fabric wrong-side-up, place the backing of the frame right-side-up on top of it.  Make sure that the portion of the fabric you selected for your composition is centered under the backing. You may wish to trim the fabric before doing this step, but make sure that you have plenty of overhang to play with if you decide to do so.  Cut the edges of the fabric so that there are 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.6 cm) of overhang past the backing on either side. You may opt to either attach the fabric to the backing or leave it free.  Trim the top and bottom so that they are practically flush with the backing of the frame. Doing so will prevent the fabric from bunching up.  Do not make the sides flush with the backing, though, since the fabric could end up sliding around inside the frame if it matches the dimensions of the frame perfectly.  If you want to attach the fabric to the backing, you could use spray adhesive or staples to do so.  Carefully place the glass back into the frame, followed by the fabric and the backing. Pull the fabric taut once more before securing the frame to the backing.  You could also leave the glass off if you want the texture of the fabric to stand out more.  Make sure that a little of the fabric sticks out of the back on either side of the frame. This will help you tighten, straighten, and otherwise adjust the fabric after you place the frame on.  This completes the project. You should now be able to use your framed fabric to adorn and beautify your walls.  ","match the frame to the fabric. choose the best composition. iron the fabric. place the backing over the fabric. trim the edges of the fabric. put the frame back together. use as desired. "
"How we feel inside is expressed in our eyes and on our faces.Learning to recognize the association between facial expressions and certain types of emotion goes a long way in being able to read emotion.  Don’t be fooled! People can manipulate their facial expressions to appear to look happy when they are angry or sad – actors do this convincingly all the time. Look for other cues as to how they really feel. Note her body language or tone of voice. Make eye contact – open, penetrating “cold” eyes suggests a different emotional state than a “warm” smile.  A genuine smile uses more muscles than one that is faked or forced. The corners of her mouth and cheeks should be raised. If the muscles around her eyes also tighten and “crow’s feet” form (clusters of wrinkles around the outer corners of eyes), then it is a good indicator of a genuine smile.  This might seem obvious, but people try to control or cover-up their true emotions by smiling when they are sad. Genuine and spontaneous emotions are hard to fake.Sadness is associated with frowning (lowering the corners of the mouth). It is also associated with raising the inner corners of the eyebrows (near the noise). Additional cues are loose, drooping eyelids that cover part of the eye.  Anger and disgust are often associated with one another and create similar facial expressions.We wrinkle our noses when we are disgusted, angry, or annoyed.  Anger and resentment can be towards someone or about something.When we are angry, we pull our eyebrows down, purse our lips (tighten them and suck-in the margins), and bulge our eyes.  In contrast to anger, expressing dislike, disgust, or disdain for someone or something is associated with a raised upper lip and loose lower lip. We also pull our eyebrows down, but not as much as when we are angry.  While fear is a negative and surprise is considered a positive emotion, both activate the sympathetic nervous system and trigger a “fight or flight” response.When something unexpected happens, whether it is good or bad, it stimulates a part of the brain that is outside of our direct control. When this happens, we pull up our eyebrows and eyelids so our eyes are wide open.When we are afraid, we also pull our eyebrows in (towards the nose), our pupils dilate (get bigger) to take in more light, and our mouth is open. We also tense up the muscles in our face, especially around our mouth and cheek.  When we are surprised, we tend to arch our eyebrows and drop our jaw. Our mouth is open, and the muscles around it are relaxed and loose.  ","take note of her facial expressions. recognize a genuine smile. distinguish sadness from happiness. recognize anger and disgust. recognize fear and surprise. "
"Both the PS4 and the Xbox One hover between the $250 and $300 marks; however, there are a few additional costs to factor in:Storage updates. This console generation's disks contain anywhere from 15 to 80 gigabytes of information; coupled with a mandatory installation process, your 500 gigabyte hard drive is going to look pretty small after a few installs. Upgrading to the one terabyte hard drive is nearly essential, and your bill will go up quite a bit when you do so.  External storage. Considering the above, you might just elect for an external drive instead. These tend to run on the expensive side, so budget for another $100 or so on top of your initial price.  Movement recognition. The Xbox One's Kinect is much more expensive than the PlayStation 4's camera that serves the same purpose, and both are considered generally superfluous anyways. If you don't care about motion tracking, this is a non-issue, but it's something to consider otherwise.  Promotional deals. Both consoles occasionally have discounts for a console and game bundle, and your local stores may slash console prices depending on how well they're selling. You can also expect a drop in console prices when the new editions of the Xbox One and the PlayStation 4 come out.;  , Do you have a PS3 or an Xbox 360? If so, you might want to stay in your console's lane; otherwise, you'll need to adapt to an entirely new operating system, flagship game franchise lineup, and email account creation.  Both the PS4 and the Xbox One have multiple flagship franchises carried over from previous generations (for example, the PlayStation has Killzone and Uncharted, while the Xbox has Halo and Gears of War). These games remain as console-specific exclusives; therefore, if you're a die-hard Halo fan, you'll probably want to stick to the Xbox One (and vice versa).  The Xbox One's ethos is more geared towards multiplayer titles than the PlayStation 4, boasting AAA exclusive titles such as Halo and Titanfall; however, the PlayStation 4 has a wide variety of rich singleplayer experiences that the Xbox One can't quite match. Your preferred style of game may dictate which console you purchase.  This is one area in which a console's titles are less important than situational context: for example, if you enjoy playing multiplayer games and all of your friends play online using PlayStation 4s, you'll probably want to disregard the Xbox One's slight multiplayer edge.  Some notable pros include the following:  Extremely responsive to first-person shooter titles (e.g., Halo, Call of Duty, and Titanfall).  Syncs with Windows 10, thereby turning your Xbox One into an entertainment system and extension of your PC.  External hard drive hookup allows you to play games right off of an external hard drive.  Supports backwards compatibility for select Xbox 360 games.  The Xbox One falls short of the PS4 in a few places:  While processing speed is more powerful than the PS4, the Xbox One's graphical processing is weaker.  You can upgrade internal storage.  Overall unit is larger and more bulky than the PS4.  Exclusives aren't all necessarily multiplayer based, there is a distinct lack of exclusive single player titles in the Xbox market.  Since most AAA games are now releasing on both platforms, you can focus on the following:Better graphical processing.  Launch titles and flagship games have more emotional depth and an emphasis on storytelling.  Upgradeable internal storage (up to two terabytes).  Generally better indie game support than the Xbox One.  Virtual Reality support.  Some notable ones are as follows:  No backwards compatibility.  No way to play games off of an external drive (though you can back up your games to an external drive).  The PS4 controller is still considered less ergonomic than the Xbox One's.  Despite the perks and drawbacks of both, you'll see most of the same titles on both platforms, and the graphics, performance, and overall quality of those titles will be close enough that--if you don't have a technical preference by now--one console's heightened performance in one area is unlikely to change your mind.

"Chop your ingredients into manageable, bite-size pieces. Cutting them up makes them easier to eat and to handle, and it also helps them cook faster and more evenly.  Different foods will need to be cut differently in order to get the best taste. Carrots, for example, are very fibrous, so you'd do well to julienne them before sautéing. Greens like spinach, on the other hand, will wilt very quickly and therefore won't need to be cut.  Try to cut the ingredients at an equal size. Ingredients chopped down to the same size will cook evenly. Ingredients that are chopped at wildly different sizes will cook unevenly, producing some food that is over- or undercooked. It sounds simple, but it's incredibly important.;  , Because you're sautéing, you want you pan to get hot before putting anything in it. This is important for several reasons:  A colder pan has hot spots.Hot spots are places on the pan where it is inordinately hotter than elsewhere. This can cause uneven cooking, leaving you with some ingredients that are overcooked and others than are undercooked. As you continue to heat the pan, the heat distributes itself evenly over the entire pan, producing a better final product.  Cold proteins on cold pans will dry out the proteins before they even begin to cook. Put a cold piece of chicken on a cold pan and your chicken will likely be much drier than had you started with the pan piping hot. Needless to say, dry food isn't ideal.  The amount will vary by recipe, and the type of fat you want to choose will affect the final dish being served. Here's a quick primer on whether to choose butter or oil as your fat:  Butter has a smoking point of 350 °F (177 °C), while most oils have a higher smoking point (375-450 °F). This means that butter burns easier than oils. If you're worried about burning your fat while you cook, opt for oils. On the other hand, butter leaves a better 'fond' (brown crust) and richer taste; if you're cooking over less heat, opt for butter.  One way to solve the flashpoint dilemma of butter is to use clarified butter or ghee. Clarified butter is simply butter with the milk solids removed. Because the milk solids are what end up burning, removing them from the butter should allow you to cook it at higher temperatures.One caution using olive oil. While many chefs prefer the taste of olive oil over other oils, it actually has a lower smoking point than other oils.For this reason, it may be beneficial to cook with a neutral oil like avocado oil (smoke point 480 ºF) and then add olive oil at the very end for taste.  Remember: you need space to move the food around in the pan. You could use a skillet or sauté pan but a standard frying pan will do the job nicely too.  Remember to start sautéing the food that takes the longest to cook first. Try to stagger the introduction of the ingredients into the pan so that the first ingredients to hit the pan are the ones that take the longest to cook.  If the ingredients or the fat starts smoking, simply remove the pan from the burner or element for a short spell and consider turning down the temperature.  It should take around 5 to 7 minutes to sauté most firm vegetables, but you can test a piece by sampling it. While the color of the ingredients is incredibly important, the taste is the real factor in determining whether an ingredient is cooked. Most vegetables sautéd should be cooked al dente, which means just undercooked (as the ingredients will continue cooking even off the heat).  Most recipes will give you cooking times for how long you should cook the ingredients. It's important to remember to only use these cooking times as rough guidelines instead of as strict edicts. Your pan, burner, the cut of the ingredients, and even your level of expertise will affect that cooking time. Try to think of cooking times as suggestions instead of as mandates.  Sample your food obsessively. In case you've never stepped foot into a professional kitchen, you might be surprised to know that chefs taste everything they cook. ('Never trust a skinny chef.') They do this to make sure that the food is cooking properly. Only taste will help you determine whether something is truly done.  Remove pan from heat and pour ingredients onto a clean kitchen towel or paper towel to remove excess oil.  Alternatively, leave the food in the pan and add any ingredients that will form sauce for the dish.  , As we've just learned, 'sautéing' is a pretty specific term. It's distinct from other cooking techniques, such as:  Pan-frying. Pan-frying doesn't involve tossing or stirring like sautéing would. (You pan-fry salmon, but you sauté collard greens.) Plus, pan-frying uses a little bit more fat at slightly lower temperatures than sautéing does.Stir-frying. Stir-frying is essentially the same as sautéing, except for two points. Stir-fry is usually cooked in a wok or wok-like pan, and in stir-fry, the sauce is made in the wok with the ingredients still in the pan, whereas in sautéing, the ingredients are taken out before the sauce is made.  Sweating. Sweating is the process of cooking vegetables, such as onions, for a short while over low heat. The goal is to get the ingredients translucent and limp, not browned and crunchy.  If you pan is hot enough and it contains enough fat, you don't need to press down on meats or veggies that you're sautéing in order to get them brown. This simply robs them of moisture. Treat your ingredients a little more delicately and they'll taste better in the end. We promise!  , A pan that is overly crowded with ingredients while sautéing will make your cooking time longer and produce uneven results. An 8- or 10-inch pan is probably perfectly acceptable for a dish for two, but a 12-inch pan might be needed for a meal with larger portions.Don't overcrowd!  Non-stick pans are good for some types of cooking, but they don't always produce the best results for sautéing in particular. That's because they don't promote as much browning as steel pans.Consider using a non-stick pan for sautéing greens like as spinach and broccoli while using a steel pan for anything else.  Even if you've prepared a marinade, try to dry your ingredients off before sautéing. Any moisture still attached to food during the cooking process will cause them to steam instead of sauté. Pat down with a paper towel, if necessary.  A digital thermometer will be able to tell you when your meat is finished cooking, eliminating the guesswork from the equation. It's a heck of a lot easy than the finger test for checking doneness.  Red meat is fully cooked at 160 °F (71 °C). Medium is measured at 135–140 °F (57–60 °C), while rare is measured at 130 °F (54 °C).Red meat can safely be cooked at varying degrees of doneness, based on the preference of the diner.  Poultry is fully cooked at 165 °F (74 °C). Poultry should always be fully cooked.  Pork is fully cooked at 160 °F (71 °C). Pork should always be fully cooked.  Seafood is generally fully cooked at 125–140 °F (52–60 °C).Seafood is often eaten rare, medium rare or slightly rare without incident.

"Look for any kind of wooden crates, like those that hold wine, apples, eggs, or milk. The crates can be new or vintage, but you will need four of the same size. Stain or paint them as you like. Once they are dry, lay the crates on their sides and screw them together so that they form one large square.The sides of the crates will serve as the tabletop.  Use the parts originally meant to hold the wine, milk, or other items as storage or shelf space below the tabletop.  Find a wooden pallet used for shipping, and four legs from an old piece of furniture or purchased new from a hardware store. Screw one leg into each corner of the bottom of the pallet. Paint or stain the whole table.Add a piece of plexiglass on top of the pallet for a smoother feel., Look for an old wooden door at a thrift store or flea market. Cut the door to about half its size (unless you want a very long coffee table). Attach four furniture legs (new or old) to the flat surface of the door, one to each of its corners. You can paint or stain the door if you like, but for extra vintage charm, leave it as-is.For a sturdier coffee table, you can screw the door to the top of an existing coffee table, or two small end tables of equal size, instead of just attaching legs to the door’s corners.  Glass makes a nice surface for any coffee table, but the frame of an old window adds a chic touch. Attach furniture legs to the corners of the window, or simply screw the window on top of a basic end table to have a small but unique coffee table.If you have a wooden box approximately the same size as your window, you can attach the two pieces together at their edges with hinges. That way, the window will still serve as the coffee table top, but the box will provide added storage.  For this project, all you have to do is drill a hole in each corner of the back of a vintage suitcase, with the front-facing portion now facing up. Then, drive screws through the holes and into the tops of four wooden or metal table legs. The closed suitcase serves as a coffee table, but opening it reveals a stylish storage space.For added strength, you can cut a piece of plywood to the size of the interior of the bottom of the suitcase. Place it in the bottom, and drive screws through it into the tops of the legs you are attaching.  Many cities now have locations that offer reclaimed wood for sale. You can often find beautiful and unique pieces that are great for coffee tables. Find a slab that’s a good size for this purpose, and use a simple finish like varnish or polyurethane to preserve the natural look. Then, attach existing table legs to the bottom.Leave imperfections like knots in the wood for a touch of rustic charm.  You can also build your own legs by using 4x4 wood cut to your preferred length. .  Some reclaimed wood centers also sell stumps or thick slices from tree trunks. If you find one of these, you can also just place the glass top from an old round table on top of the chunk of wood for a simple coffee table., For a really simple project, you can take a coffee table you already have, and paint or restain it. Remove the glass, if it has any, and use paint/stain remover to strip the old finish off.

"Pour 1/4 inch (6.35 mm) of cooking oil into a deep skillet and heat it on medium-high for a few minutes.  You will not need to completely immerse the kohlrabi fritters in oil, so you do not need enough oil to cover them completely. You do, however, need enough oil to completely cover the bottoms.  Use a box shredder to shred the kohlrabi bulbs into fine strands.  For this method, you only need the bulb of the kohlrabi and not the leaves.  Transfer the shredded kohlrabi into a medium to large mixing bowl and add an egg. Mix well to coat evenly, then add the flour and mix well again.  The final result should be a thick mush that can be formed into patties or mounds.  Once the oil is hot enough, spoon out dollops of the kohlrabi mush into the oil.  Gently flatten each small mound with the back of your spatula to create a patty instead of a clump.  Cook the kohlrabi fritters for 2 to 4 minutes before flipping with your spatula. Cook the other side for another 2 to 4 minutes., Transfer the kohlrabi fritters onto a plate lined with clean paper towels.

"Find them from the area where you will be hiding to best blend in. Don’t use twigs, which will irritate your skin and get in the way. Foliage is best used in addition to another method, such as paint or a bandana. It is difficult to cover your entire face with foliage, but adding some to your camouflage will help you to blend in even better.  Although not very common, applying natural foliage directly on your face is a useful form of camouflage. This works best with the use of a ghillie suit so that your entire body is covered in vegetation.  If you are wearing a hat, stick a few leaves or blades of grass around the rim. Make sure you don’t cover your eyes. If you are wearing a helmet, you can stick grass or leaves into the strap. You can also cover your neck by sticking some foliage in the top of your shirt.You could also place a few long blades of grass behind your ear.  If the foliage is not staying in place, you could pin, glue, or tape it onto your clothing. Just make sure the adhesive isn’t visible.  Sticking a little mud on the foliage will also help it to stay in place.  You could also buy a mesh mask and place foliage in the holes of the mesh. Just make sure not to cover your eyes, ears, or mouth with foliage.  For best results, all foliage should be fresh. Wilted foliage will not be effective. Simply gather some more leaves or grass from your surroundings and add them to your clothing or gear.

"When someone is annoying you it can be easy to respond emotionally, without thinking. Getting emotional about a coworker’s behaviour isn’t going to help the situation get any better. In fact, there’s a good chance that an emotional reaction will make the situation worse. The only person you have control over is you, so learn to control your reactions.When your coworker does something annoying, give yourself a moment to look at how you react. How do you feel? What’s going through your mind? What do you do, if anything? What specific event triggered this reaction?  Once you’ve had a chance to think about how YOU respond to your coworker, think about whether that reaction is worth it. You likely have to spend a lot of energy to get upset — is your coworker worth that added stress? Not likely.  Develop a system for altering your reactions to your coworker. Maybe you need to take a minute and breathe deeply, or count to 10. Maybe you just need to close your eyes and visualize your ‘happy place.’  The next time your coworker does something annoying, use the system you developed. Over time your system will become easier to use, and will soon become your instinctual reaction.;  , Sometimes you have to work near someone who annoys you, but you don’t have to work with that person. Maybe they sit at a desk near you, but they aren’t in the same department. Or maybe you pass them by now and again in the hallway, but you never see them otherwise. Instead of expending the energy and effort to tolerate or deal with this coworker, avoid them., Some annoying people become more annoying the longer you have to interact with them. Keep your interactions with these people as short as possible. Don’t bother with nice conversation starters or questions about their weekend, just get to the point. Once the (short) interaction is complete, allow your coworker the chance to have the last word, then walk away. Don’t drag the interaction out longer than needed, and don’t allow your coworker to monopolize your time., Gossiping at work happens a lot. You’ve probably gossiped about someone else, and your coworkers have probably gossiped about you. Some gossip is harmless (e.g. why can’t they get that elevator to work property), but other gossip can be quite upsetting (e.g. Susan slept with the boss). Some of the most hurtful gossip is when someone speaks negatively about a coworker. You most likely never want to be the one your coworkers are gossiping about, so don’t gossip about them.‘Ranting’ to someone about the problems and issues you’re having at work is important, as it relieves stress and makes you feel better. If you feel the need to talk about a coworker’s behaviour, talk to someone who doesn’t work with you.  No one wants to think THEY may be the problem, and not someone else, but it is a possibility. Is it possible that your coworkers annoy you for reasons that are beyond their control? For example, are you jealous that they have a better job, get paid more, or get to sit near the window? Is it possible you’re interpreting your unhappiness about a specific situation as dislike or annoyance?, Tolerating means you realize your coworker does something annoying, but you’re not going to care. Not caring means you ignore your coworker’s behaviour, or it means you don’t allow yourself to react to the behaviour anymore. Instead, you accept the behaviour for what it is and move on.This type of response is easier said than done because you really do have to move on and let go. You can’t push your frustration about the behaviour to the back of your mind and try to pretend it doesn’t exist. Doing this will only make you feel worse in the long run.  There is no requirement that you have to talk about your personal life when you’re at work. Yet you probably have one or more coworkers who like to pry anyway. These coworkers may also be the type who want to provide you with advice and suggestions on everything from your hair, to how to parent your children, to where you should go on vacation. The best approach with this type of coworker is to simply change the subject., Some coworkers will ask if you need help with a task because they’re genuinely nice people and want to be helpful. Other coworkers may ask if you need help with a task because it’ll make them look good, or you’ll owe them a favour at some point in the future. They’re not asking because they’re being nice, they’re asking because they have a plan. In situations like this you need to learn to just say no. In the long run, the type of help these coworkers are offering is no the kind of help you need.  ","alter your reaction. avoid your coworker. get to the point. keep things to yourself. consider why your coworker annoys you. put up with your coworker. change the subject. learn to say no. "
"It’s much easier to remember facts if you understand why those facts are true. Ask yourself, or your teacher: why do things work the way they do? If you understand the larger conceptual framework, you will be able to retrieve knowledge more easily and even guess more accurately.  ]For example, if you have to memorize geographical borders, think about how those borders were formed. Notice that in many places, borders follow natural features such as rivers and mountain ranges. By observing a general rule like this you save yourself from having to memorize each individual border; instead, you can remember which borders follow this rule.  You are more likely to remember something if you can associate it with other, related things. Tell a story to yourself about a particular fact: even if your story is light-hearted, it will cement the fact in your mind.  This is sometimes call the Baker/baker paradox. Shown a picture of a woman, people are much more likely to remember that she is a baker than that her name is Baker. This is because the idea of being a baker has more associations. It conjures up thoughts of bread and might suggest links with the image: perhaps her face looks doughy, for example., Assess yourself by asking whether you are absorbing new material and whether you understand the big concepts that underlie that material. Reflect on what aspects of the learning process have worked for you and what aspects were less helpful. This kind of self-evaluation is known as metacognition, and it has been shown to improve your ability to transfer what you’ve learned to new settings and situations., Sometimes you are allowed to choose between taking a final exam or completing a final project. In other cases, you might have the choice to take a class that assigns a project. Where possible, choose the final project. Completing a complex project related to the knowledge area is associated with greater retention of knowledge than taking a test alone., Instead, turn from one task to another, and intersperse studying one subject with studying something else.Look for connections between the different topics. Seeing how knowledge fits together into a larger picture will help you to understand its significance and remember it better.  ","link your knowledge to larger concepts. connect facts to ideas. evaluate your own learning process. opt for the final project. don’t focus on just one thing for too long. "
"Add the cinnamon stick. Slowly bring to the boil.  Be liberal with the quantity.  Whisk until the chocolate is totally combined through the milk.  This is optional, only if you like it.

"Say your day was fine up to midday.;  , About five minutes after you've been picked up, wrap your arms around your stomach and say you have a little bit of a stomachache.  Every minute or so, just make a small 'ugh/appropriate distress' sound.  Say you need a rest before attending the activity you participate in.  Remember: when you're sick, you don't show off your sickness; you only emit signals showing sickness. Whenever contacted, look sad or grumpy as if something isn't right, and remain quiet. However, don't be a mime - just speak very little and speak softly.  Clutch your stomach and look like you're in pain.  If your parent or guardian asks if you're okay, make them aware that you aren't feeling too good, but 'reassure' them that you will be fine for practice; but make it clear that if you get any worse, skipping the session will have to be an option.  Don't exaggerate how much you want to go to this activity. This can make your parents believe that you love the activity, and sign you up for more of it when that's not what you wanted!  , Bring on the drowsiness, headaches and whatever else you are prone to getting, illness-wise. If you fail, prolong your act through practice.  This will create bags under your eyes, which will help convince your parents that you got worse as the night went on. If they suggest or try to give you medicine, go to the kitchen and get a glass of water. Don't take the pill - quietly throw it away. Go back to your parents with the glass and pretend to put the pill into your mouth and take a sip of water and gulp the rest down. This will hopefully convince them you took the pill.  Eliminate one symptom of your sickness at a time so they won't take you to the doctor the next day, and to avoid getting in trouble for faking.

"“Affect” means to make a change in something. Another way of looking at is it influences objects or things. It comes from a Latin word meaning “acted upon.”;  , Most of the time, “affect” is used as a verb. A verb is the action in a sentence. The subject (a noun or pronoun) does the action. So someone or something (the noun) is affecting (the verb) something else.  Consider something that changes or influences something else. You could talk about rain changing water levels or a well-written novel moving someone. Sentences that properly use the word “affect” and address these topics include:  “The heavy rain affected the water levels in the local lake.”  “The tense, detailed writing affected him, moving him to tears.”  , When “affect” is used as a noun, it generally describes a person’s facial expressions. Examples include:  ”The murderer took the news of the jury’s decision with little affect.”  ","understand the meaning of the word “affect”. be aware of what part of speech “affect” is. try using “affect” in a sentence. understand that “affect” can sometimes be used as a noun.

"Select a palette knife if you have one, or a slim butter knife if you don't. Push the vertical knife down between the cake edge and the pan. Carefully move the knife around the entire cake to loosen the sides. Stay as close to the pan edge as possible to minimize the amount you cut into your cake.  If the cake is for a major occasion, you may want to try the other methods first. This one often causes minor damage.  If the cake burned onto the sides, saw up and down slowly to break it loose. You may need to go around the cake four or five times.;  , Push the spatula down at the edge of the pan, as you did with the knife. This time, lever the spatula inward as you move around the cake. This tool should be flexible enough to separate the perimeter of the base from the pan.  If the cake is seriously stuck, don't try to force it off. Skip down to one of the other methods instead.  You can use a thin metal spatula or pizza peel instead. Run hot water over it first, as the heat and moisture can help unstick the cake.  Place a large plate over the cake pan. Hold them firmly together and flip them upside down. Shake the pan softly until the cake comes out.  You may flip it onto a cooling rack instead. Keep something underneath the rack to catch crumbs.

"Chinese bonds, especially corporate bonds, can be a lucrative investment for a savvy investor. However, market involvement by foreign parties is limited by the Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (QFII) program. This program sets an upper limit for investment by foreign investors.Some trading platforms or banks may be able to get you in to the market, but check with them first to see if they offer this service.  Also available are the so-called 'panda bonds,' which are bonds denominated in Chinese currency but sold by non-Chinese companies. The issuers of the bonds are typically more familiar outside of China, so investors looking for greater certainty may want to turn to these bonds., Chinese corporate bonds are those sold by Chinese companies. Like other corporate bonds, they typically carry a higher interest rate than government bonds, due to their higher perceived risk. The Chinese market recently opened access to small and medium company bond offerings, giving investors a chance to invest in these even riskier, higher-returning bonds.Remember to thoroughly research any investment, especially in risky corporate bonds, and assess your risk tolerance before investing.  The market for Chinese debt issued on the mainland is generally restricted to institutions and may bar individuals from investing. Investors barred from entering the market can instead invest in what are known as 'dim sum bonds.' These Yuan-denominated bonds are issued in Hong-Kong and are more readily available to foreign investors., Chinese government bonds are those issued directly by the Chinese government. These bonds are issued in Chinese Yuan, rather than USD, so foreign exchange risk must be considered. As of late 2015, these bonds were only available in the United Kingdom, so check with your broker before investigating this investment further., These funds invest in a variety of emerging market bonds, including both government and corporate bonds. Each individual fund also varies in its geographical focus, but all focus mainly on countries outside of North America and Europe. Investing in bond funds allows the investor to usually experience less risk than they would have if they simply invested in foreign bonds themselves. However, there is significant risk associated with these bond funds as well.Be sure to choose a fund that is the right mix of high returns and lower risk. Analyze several different funds and consider the tradeoffs between them.  Like many emerging economies, China's economy has yet to become as stable as a developed economy, like that of the United States. This means that economic factors that influence security prices, like interest rates and government regulations, can change dramatically in short periods of time. This can have dramatic effects on your portfolio's returns. Additionally, buying many of these investments in the Yuan opens you up to foreign exchange risk if the value of the Yuan drops relative to the US Dollar. Take these risks into account when investing in China.

"If you are buying a second home, you will need it to be in a location that is optimal. Select a spot where the home will get the most use. You may be able to rent it when you are not using it yourself, but you may not. If your favorite vacation spot is a bit off the beaten track, you may not be able to earn back any income. Make sure that the location is right for you.Consider how far you want to travel. As a general rule of thumb, to get the most use out of your vacation home, it should be no more than a two- to three-hour drive from your primary home.;  , If you are buying a second home, you will become a member of the community. This is different than simply vacationing at a resort or hotel for one or two weeks a year. It would make sense to visit often enough to get to know the area, the community, the people. If you have children, you may want to find out about schools in the vicinity. Look at the location through the eyes of a resident and not a vacationer., If you are only going to visit this property temporarily, then security will be an issue. Consider the safety of the neighborhood. Select a location that is likely to be safe, or think about investing in a security monitoring service that can watch the home while you are away., Spend plenty of time vacationing in the area where you want to buy a home to figure out your ideal location. Prioritize the area's amenities, and then look in the neighborhoods that best fit your top picks. Consider ease of transportation to and from the airport or major roadways, and whether or not you want to be able to travel easily to other locales., Are you looking to buy a home that your entire family will use regularly right now, and then may resell in a few years? Or do you want a smaller place where you might retire? Is this home a place that you want primarily to live in, or is it mainly an investment property? The answers to these questions will help guide the kind of property you should consider buying.If you are considering this as an investment, you should consider its future resale value. What makes a second home affordable today could make it more difficult to sell tomorrow. Think about unsightly power lines, road noise, or a run-down neighborhood. Imagine what future home buyers will see. What will this part of town look like in five to 20 years? And the quality of local schools is always important, unless you're buying in a retirement community., If the home is furnished and in a popular location, demand will not be a problem if you want to rent it out. But keep in mind that someone needs to market the property, manage the booking calendar, clean the unit between renters, collect fees, and more. Make sure you're willing to do the work, or willing to pay a rental property management company to do it for you.If you are hoping to rent the property while you are away, you should investigate the local zoning requirements or other housing regulations. This may not be allowed in all areas., While the Internet allows buyers to do a great deal of the house hunting on their own, an experienced real estate agent in the location where you want your second home can be very valuable. A local agent can watch the market for you and let you know when properties become available. A local agent will know the community and can help advise you with neighborhood selection, safety and security, and resale considerations.When you are selecting an agent to help you buy a property, you will want someone with experience and connections in the community. Ask how long the agent or agency has been in business in that location. Ask about the agent's own involvement in community groups or other organizations.  There are numerous Internet sites that help in searching for real estate to purchase. Using these sites, you can select a specific location and narrow your search by the size of the property, approximate value, and even certain amenities that you want available. When you run a search on one of these sites, you will obtain a list of properties that meet your specifications. Each listing will give you the contact information of the owner or selling real estate agent. You can then contact them to make an appointment to visit and see the property. Some of the most common, reliable sites are Zillow.com and MLS.com., Particularly if you are looking for a vacation home in a small, rural area, you may find the best information in a local or regional newspaper. The paper might even have a separate section for vacation properties either for sale or rentals.  Many print newspapers, where you might begin your search, will also allow you access to an online search feature. For example, if you are looking in the greater New York area, you can look in the New York Times or use its online features.Another print newspaper that incorporates an online search feature is the Los Angeles Times, One way to familiarize yourself with the neighborhood, while also doing some house hunting, is simply to drive around the community yourself. You can get to know the neighborhood while watching for “For Sale” signs at the same time.  Buying a second home is a very big investment. The first cost that you have to plan is the purchase price of the home itself. You will need to review your own income and current monthly expenses. This should give you an idea of the available cash that you have that you can put toward a vacation home. If you have the luxury of being able to buy the property outright, that’s terrific. If not, you will need to plan for a mortgage and the additional monthly payments.The median price for vacation homes in 2013 was $168,700. This is a national average, so the price may fluctuate widely, depending on the location you select.  When you go on vacation to a hotel or resort, such things as dishes, silverware, food, towels, laundry soap, and other household necessities are provided for you. But when you buy your own vacation home, you must consider the cost of providing all these for yourself. This may be small compared to the total cost of the home, but all the little items can add up., In addition to the purchase price and the additional costs of providing for yourself in the home, there are numerous costs related to owning any home. You will need to research these for the area where your prospective vacation home is located, and add them in to your cost estimates:Property tax. You can research this at the town hall or ask a local real estate agent for some estimates.  Homeowner’s insurance. Your own insurance company, if it does business in the state where your vacation home is located, should be able to help you with this.  Utilities, water and trash. Even if you are not living in the property all year, you probably will be responsible for these costs all year.  Winterization. If the vacation home is in an area that gets cold or freezes, and receives snow, you will need to invest some money in making sure that your water pipes are safe. You may also be required to pay for snow removal, even if you are not present.  Security monitoring.  Landscaping or property maintenance.  Homeowner’s association or condominium fees, if applicable.  If you are planning to use this vacation home on a regular basis, you will probably wind up making additional purchases of items to help you enjoy your vacation. This may include all or some of the following:Skis or lift costs  Kayak, canoe or other boating supplies  Admission to area attractions  , After you have selected a potential vacation home, you will need to decide a fair purchase price. A local real estate agent should be able to help you with information about recent sales of comparable properties in the area. Additionally, you can search for property values on Internet real estate sites like Zillow.com and MLS.com.For example, if you visit www.zillow.com, you will see a bar in the center of the screen with four options. Select “Zestimate.” You will be prompted to enter the property address. You will then be redirected to a screen that shows the property location and gives you an estimate of its fair value. It also shows the estimated sales information for similar properties in that city or town over the past several years.  If you believe that the asking price is reasonable, then you may want to submit an offer that is near the asking price. If not, then you may offer a lower price and expect to negotiate to end up at a price in the middle. When submitting your offer, consider the demand for properties in the area. If you are looking in a location with high demand, then you may need to submit an offer that is nearly up to the asking price.You should be able to find out how long the property has been on the market. If it is a new listing, then the buyer’s may be expecting to get an offer close to their asking price. If it has been on the market for some time, you might be able to offer low and get a bargain.  Unless you make an offer for the full asking price, the seller is likely to come back to you with some kind of counteroffer. You may then respond to that counteroffer. This procedure can continue for several rounds until you and the seller reach an agreement. In this negotiating, you may also want to ask for certain terms or conditions as part of your offer:Closing costs.  Time for financing.  Seller payment of real estate taxes.  Prorating condo or homeowner’s fees.  When you and the seller agree on a price and the terms of the sale, the real estate broker should then handle most of the details of the purchase. You will need to secure your own financing, unless you have the resources to pay cash for the property. This process generally takes a number of weeks before you are able to have the closing. During that time, keep in regular contact with the broker to make sure that no surprises arise that could change the purchase of the home.Depending on the property, the lending bank, and your level of interest, you may wish or even be required to conduct a home inspection. You will want to make sure that all the utilities are functioning, that the house is in solid condition, and that any defects are properly noted. If you find serious deficiencies, they could result in a renegotiation of the sale price.

"Bullies will try to convince you that if you 'tattle' on them, they will make things worse for you. They may even tell you that you will get yourself in trouble. However, talking to someone who has the power to stop the bullying should always be your first course of action.Any aggressive, threatening, or violent behavior should be reported to the police immediately. If you fear for your safety or your life, call 911.  Bullies often target people who they believe won't tell on them, or who they believe they can convince not to report their behavior.  If a bully gets in trouble for their actions, they are unlikely to repeat them. You may be afraid of getting someone else in trouble, or tell yourself that what they're doing isn't really 'that bad.' However, if it's hurting you or making you feel uncomfortable, it's worth telling someone about.  Choose someone you trust, and who you know will believe you and take action on your behalf. For example, if you're getting bullied at school and you don't trust your teacher to stop the bullying, you may be able to talk to another teacher, coach, or school administrator with whom you have a closer relationship.  If you're an adult and are getting bullied at work, it may be more difficult to find someone to tell – especially if the bully is your immediate supervisor. In that situation, even telling a co-worker you trust can help, because they can go with you to present a united front.;  , Many autistic people have social anxiety or other issues that make it difficult to trust others and seek help from them. Search online for bullying hotlines in your area where you can talk to someone who will help you.People who work at bullying hotlines are professionally trained to talk to victims of bullying and help them, so you know you can trust the person who takes your call.  Even if you're calling a hotline specifically designed to take calls from autistic people, tell the person who takes your call that you are autistic. If there are any accommodations you require that will make it easier for you to talk on the phone, let them know.  If you don't want to use the phone, look for a hotline online that will allow you to submit your statement in an online form or by sending an email.  Get yourself a special notebook for recording details about the bullying you are experiencing. As soon as possible after an incident occurs, write an entry in your diary that explains where you were, what happened, and who was there.A written record can help you establish the bully's pattern of behavior, especially if the incidents typically take place when there aren't many other people around to witness it.  If someone is bullying or harassing you online, take screen-caps of the messages or comments from the bully so you have a record of the behavior even if it's later deleted.  Share your diary with a trusted friend or family member so they can help you. It also may help to show the diary to an adult or authority figure so they understand more about what's going on.  Particularly if you have problems communicating with people, or have social anxiety issues, they may understand more about the threat you're facing by reading your diary than you could tell them yourself.  Bullies are less likely to bother you if you are surrounded by other people. If you are in school, try to stay close to a teacher or other adult as much as possible. Bullies are much less likely to act if someone with authority is nearby.As an autistic person, you may not have a lot of friends. This can present challenges, especially if your friend has a different schedule than you do. Explain the situation to your friend and ask if they can introduce you to other people who will be with you when they are not to provide 'safety in numbers.'  Especially in a school situation, stick close by adults, even if you don't know them very well. Teachers and other adults have a responsibility to monitor student behavior, and bullies will seldom act out against their victims when an adult is present.  In a work or extra-curricular situation, try to avoid situations in which you can be isolated. For example, you might want to ask a trusted co-worker if they will go to the bathroom with you so you don't give the bully an opportunity to get you alone.  Your special interests are a powerful tool that you can use to make friends who will appreciate your skills and knowledge in spite of your differences. These people can help protect you from bullies.Participating in a group also can enhance your self-esteem, particularly if the group revolves around something that you enjoy and have researched extensively.  If you have difficulty communicating, try to find a single person in the group who you can use as your 'point person.' Communicate to them and let them help you connect to the other people in the group.  When you make valuable contributions to the group, the members of the group will find you important and valuable. This will make them more inclined to protect you and stand up against others who might try to bully you.

"Before making any journal entries, make sure you understand the lease agreement's terms. For example, consider a lease agreement whereby Company A leases a building to Company B for 10 years. Company B will pay a rental payment of $12,000 at the beginning of each year. The building's useful life is 12 years; therefore, this is a capital lease because the lease term is greater than 75 percent of the asset's life.  Before learning the journal entries it is important to understand the basic accounting process. From an accounting perspective, when you enter into a capital lease, you are basically purchasing the asset, and then financing it using a loan. Therefore the accounting would be very similar to if you simply bought and financed an asset. This means you would first need to add the asset to the balance sheet as a fixed asset, and also add the value of the asset to the balance sheet as a capital lease liability (since you do not own the asset).  Over the term of the lease, regular payments consisting of interest and principal would be made. The interest portion of the payment would be recorded as an interest expense on the income statement, and the principal would reduce the balance of the capital lease liability.  For example, assume you were leasing an asset worth $10,000. This means $10,000 would be listed as an asset on the balance sheet, and $10,000 would be listed as a capital lease liability. If you had a $1,000 yearly payment, and $100 was interest, $900 would go towards reducing the capital lease liability account. Over time, this means the capital lease liability account would eventually reach zero..  Finally, you would need account for depreciation. Since assets depreciate over their useful life, you would need to account for the declining value of the asset each year.  The journal entries will reflect the fact that the lease is essentially a sale. For example, assume Company A leases a building to Company B for 10 years, with an annual rent payment of $12,000.Assume the value of the building is $120,000. Note that the value of the asset is supposed to be equal to the present value of all future rent payments. In this example, we are assuming the value of the building is equal to the sum of all future rent payments ($12,000 times 10 years). In reality, this would be less, since those future rent payments must be discounted to account for the fact that money received in the future is worth less than money received now.  To begin, open whatever accounting software you are using, debit the 'Building' asset account for $120,000, and credit the Lease Payable liability account for $120,000. If these accounts aren't available in your accounting program, you must create them.  This transaction recognizes the building and the lease on the balance sheet.  Now that the lease is recognized on the balance sheet, you must account for the rental payments. On January 1 each year, you must make a payment to recognize your lease payments to the lessor.  To do this, you would debit Lease Payable for $12,000 and credit Cash for $12,000.  Doing this reduces the value of the Lease payable liability account, to reflect the fact that the principle on the 'loan' is being paid down. This transaction also reduces cash as you are paying the lessee.  Note that this assumes there is no interest involved. If part of that $12,000 annual payment is interest, you must debit that portion to the Interest Expense account.  For example, suppose that the $12,000 payment included 10 percent interest.  This means that $1,090 of that payment was interest expense.  Therefore, you would record a debit of $10,910 to the capital lease liability account, a debit of $1,090 to the interest expense account and a credit of $12,000 to the accounts payable account.These journal entries will continue to deplete the balance of the Lease Payable account until they reach 0 at the agreement's end.  You may also make monthly payments. Account for it in the same way, but repeat the process twelve times--once for each month.  , Because a capital lease is treated like a purchase agreement, the lessee will need to record depreciation on the asset in question. In the example above, you would need to depreciate the $120,000 balance in the Building account over its life. The required journal entries would vary depending on the company's depreciation schedule.Depreciation involves taking the value of the asset ($120,000), and reducing its value over the course of its life (10 years). For example, using straight-line depreciation, the asset would depreciate by $12,000 per year ($120,000/10=$12,000{\displaystyle \$120,000/10=\$12,000}).  To account for this, you must charge that amount to the income statement as an expense each year. The basic procedure is to debit the depreciation expense account by $12,000, and then credit the accumulated depreciation account for $12,000.  ","evaluate the terms of the lease. review the basic accounting process for recognizing a capital lease. start by recording the journal entries to recognize the start of the lease. record the journal entry to recognize each rental payment. record any necessary depreciation expenses.

"If the room looks modern, you'll want to avoid ornate, wooden frames. If the room is classic, you'll want to avoid sleek or brushed metal, modern-looking frames. Of course, this rule can be broken in order to make a design statement.;  , Older style pictures will generally look more at home in older styled frames. You will also want to consider the color of your picture. If black and white, it will look better with a colored or black/white frame. If the picture has color, it can look better with either color frames or wooden frames.  You'll have to decide if you want a thin frame, thick frame, shadow box frame, or other styled frame. Some pictures, such as printed canvases, might look better with no frame at all!  , Do you want the picture to feature prominently in the room and take up a large amount of space or do you want to have it be smaller and simply be a beautiful detail to the room? You'll have to decide what works better for your design.  Think about how big the picture is going to be. Now, do you want there to be a lot of space between the picture itself and the frame? Or do you want there to be no space at all? 1-2' of mat (or space between the frame an picture) is normal, as is no mat whatsoever. However, you can make a dramatic statement by having a larger gap (4-6' or more).  Of course, this is relative to the size of the picture. If the picture is enormous, a 4' mat might be very reasonable.  Generally, black, white, and brown are considered good neutral colors that will generally match with most pictures. You can also go with colors, however. This is an especially good idea if you really want to make a picture pop, and draw attention to it in the room.  Generally, you would choose a color by finding a highlight or significant color in the picture and then making the frame that color. For example, if your degree has a red seal, you might make that pop by having it framed in a matching red as well.  If you decide to have a gap between the frame and the picture, you'll need a mat. This is a piece of paper, cardboard, or cardstock which creates a secondary 'frame' for the picture. You'll need to decide what color you want your mat to be. Usually, a white or cream color is used, but you can also use more brightly colored mats which compliment your picture.  Take the measurement of your picture and add the width you want for your mat to get the mat size. Let's frame an imaginary 8x10 photo. For this photo, we want a mat with a 1.5' width. So the measurements for the mat become 11x13' (since the width needs to be added to each side).  Measure a square corner, using a tool if you have one, and then cut the mat to the desired measurement. Use a box cutter or other extremely sharp tool in order to get a clean line. Our mat will be 11x13' around the outside.  Cut the inside edge where you want the picture to go. The usual advice is to have the gap on the bottom marginally larger than the one on top (this should be almost imperceptible). Dry fit it to figure out where you want it and then measure and cut a hole in the center of the mat that fits the measurement of your image.  A good tip is to measure the exact shape, in this case the 8x10 rectangle, and then make the actual cuts just inside of the line you drew. This way you won't accidentally end up with gaps where you made the hole too big.  Fit the picture into the hole for the mat. Take two pieces of tape and use them to bridge the gap along the top line. These should be evenly spaced, towards the center. Next, take two more pieces of tape and place these over the top, mat-side of the first tape pieces. The long edge of these pieces should follow the line of where the picture and mat meet.  This is a safe way to tape photos to mats, since the tap can simply be cut where the picture and mat meet, leaving only minimal tape on the picture itself.  We're going to make a frame for our theoretical 8x10 photo with our 1.5' width mat. You'll need:  1x2 lumber in a wood type of your choice  1/4' square dowels in a matching or pleasantly contrasting wood of your choice  5 mm diameter dowel rods  A miter box, saw, square measure, and measuring tape  Glue and rubber bands  Materials to make a basic jig, such as plywood.  Optional materials like paint or stain  , For now just think about the 1x2s. The inside measurement of that portion of the frame will be the same size as your mat, with the outside measurement adding the additional length for the miter. Cut the 1x2s to the size you'll need for the outside measurement of the frame. Once you have your 1x2s cut, cut your square dowels to the same measurement.  In our example, since the 1x2s are actually 1.5' x .75', we need to add 1.5' to each end to get the outer edge measurement. So the short side pieces will then be 14' and the long side pieces will be 16'.  Glue the square dowel to the 1x2, so that the faces are flush.  Using a box miter (or miter saw, if you have one), cut the ends of the four pieces so that they are at a 45 degree angle. The short end of each miter should be on the side with the square dowel. Sand any rough edges.  The measurement on one side of the short pieces should now be 14', with the other at 11'.  The measurement on one side of the long pieces should now be 16', with the other side at 13'.  Set out a plywood sheet. Measure out the outline of the 14x16' frame, as well as the inside 11x13' shape. Nail small pieces of scrap wood at the center on both the inside and outside lines, so that the pieces of the frame can sit snugly between them with the mitered corners still accessible. Glue the mitered edges and then insert the pieces into the jig (careful not to glue them to the surface).  Using a drill, make pilot holes and then drill a 5 mm hole for your dowels at each of the four corners. This should pass diagonally through the corner, passing at the halfway point along the mitered edge. Then, cover your dowel in glue and fit it through the hole. There should be some extra sticking out on either side. Stretch rubber band around the dowel ends on opposite sides of the frame to hold it together and then remove it from the jig. Allow the glue to dry.  Score and snap off the extra dowel ends and then sand it down until it's smooth. You can now paint or stain your picture frame.  You can get glass custom cut to the measurement of the larger square (so that it nestles in the recess created by the square dowels). You can also buy clear acrylic and cut it to size (score on one side and then snap). Place the plastic into the recess, followed by your mat and picture. A backing can be added or you can use nails or clips to hold the picture and glass in place.

"The first few ants you see are “scout” ants looking for food or nesting sources. If you can address the problem while there are just a few ants, you are more likely to permanently remove them from your house.  Spray a solution of 1 part distilled white vinegar to 1 part water on entryway points or ant trails. The scout ants make trails that other ants can follow. Although this is tedious work, it can confuse them while you find your solution.  ;  ,  Take a close-up photo of the ant. Email it to the office and ask what type of ant you are dealing with. Local extension offices often keep files on local plants, insects and animals.  Ask for an information packet on ridding your house or yard of this type of ants. They may be able to give you special instructions on the best methods.  If you are dealing with carpenter ants, call an exterminator immediately. They can cause structural damage in the home.  If the ant nest is outside, this indicates that there are holes in the home allowing the ants to come in and look for food.  If the ant nest is inside, it indicates that you have soft, water-damaged areas of the home that need to be reconstructed. Remove damaged sections of the wall or cabinet, so that you can set bait on the nest itself.  If you know the ant nest is inside, but you are unable to get at the area, you may want to call a professional exterminator. Shortly after, you will want to get advice from a contractor about how to repair the damage to your home.  Chemicals are more likely to produce results quickly.  Curious pets or small kids are good reasons to try natural remedies first.  Ant traps, keep the bait and chemicals inside a small plastic trap, meaning there is less mess and chemical distribution around your house.  Set the traps around ant entry points, such as windows, doorways or cracked foundations.  Look for traps that bait both sweet and grease eating ants. Ants’ food preferences change throughout the year, so these traps are more versatile.  This natural remedy is extremely effective, if you have established where the nests are. It dries out the ants, killing them within 3 days.  Diatomaceous earth is a sedimentary rock made from fossilized algae. It absorbs lipids from the surface of insects, dehydrating them.  You can use borax by spreading it on nests and windowsills in a similar fashion. Although borax isn’t dangerous to adults, it can be toxic in large quantities and if eaten by small children.  If you see ants away from the nest, then you can kill them where they are without using harsh chemicals.  Mix a solution of 2 tbsp. (30ml) of dishwashing liquid in 16 oz. (0.5l) of water. Pour it into a spray bottle.  Follow the ants and spritz them. Wipe up dead ants with paper towels.  Spray an insecticide on your lawn an hour after you mow it. Ants may start on the lawn and move closer to the house over time. Buy a lawn spray insecticide and repeat every year.  Trim bushes, trees and flowers that are close to the house. Letting plants touch the house creates bridges for the ants to find a pathway inside. Trim every year to avoid ant problems.  Seal up windows and foundation with sealing caulk. If you rent your home, then ask a landlord to caulk areas where you know there is a problem.  Vacuum your kitchen and dining areas daily. Even the smallest food crumbs can attract ants.  Discourage eating in other areas of the house.  Wipe counters with dishwashing liquid and water solutions or vinegar and water solutions. They will erase ant trails and clean surfaces.

"The thin layer will ensure even toasting of the rice grains.;  , Toast the rice until it takes on a dark brown color and emits a nutty, toasted aroma. Depending upon heat and pan, toasting time can vary, but it generally does not exceed much over five minutes. Do not leave the rice unattended because it can burn quickly.  Then place the rice inside of a container for storage. Toast more rice if desired.  One tablespoon of toasted brown rice will produce one strong cup of tea. Experiment with these amounts to suit your preference. Place the desired amount of rice inside of a tea sieve along with green tea leaves. One teaspoon of green tea leaves will produce one cup of tea.  Plunge the tea sieve into the water once it is ready.

"This is for taking notes.;  , Examples are: Basic Personality, Family and Relationships, Health and Leisure, Career and Abilities, and Strengths and Weaknesses.  But don't rely too much on the traditional interpretations of the cluster types.  Just relying on the four elements' signs can be misleading so don't rely on this too heavily. But the modes are more accurate. Cardinal means initiative. Fixed signs mean stubbornness and rigidity, and passion. Mutable signs often indicate flexibility and a good mind.  Start always with the ASC or Ascendant. Then the Sun in Sign, Sun in House, Sun's Aspects, the Moon, and so on.  For example, a Moon in Taurus will have something to say about that person's basic character, family relations (the mother especially), emotional needs, talents and health.  For each Subject Heading, insert the relevant keywords from that placement. In the case of a Taurus Moon, keywords and phrases such as 'emotional stability' for Basic Personality, 'loyalty' and 'constancy' for Relationships, 'fertility' and 'good singing voice' in Health and Leisure, etc.  , For example, 'quick temper' and 'self-centeredness' may be suggested by a Sun in Aries, a Sun Square Mars, a Stellium in Aries or Leo, and a Sun Conjunct Midheaven (MC). When this happens, you can be sure you have found a dominant trait in your subject's psyche.  On the other hand, if a trait is suggested only once, it may not be that strong unless it is a very close aspect or the planet involved is strong (personalized, ruling, dignified, etc.). Do not stress a trait too much if you are not sure it is that influential.  Then think of the qualities of that planet, sign or house. Consider this when writing your interpretation.

"The fees for a stop-payment order may be so high relative to the face value of the check that a stop-payment order doesn't make any sense. Or, if one or several checks were lost or stolen, the potential financial harm may be great.If the costs outweigh the benefits of getting a stop-payment order, it may make more sense for you simply to close your checking account. Although switching bank accounts can be a hassle, you won't have to continue to pay stop-payment fees, or have to worry about whether that check will go through anyway.  Closing your checking account also might be a good idea if the check was for a significant amount of money. Although the stop-payment fee is relatively low in that case compared to the amount of the check, if the check was honored anyway it would be a much bigger deal.  If you decide you want to go ahead and close your checking account and open a new one, you should speak to someone at the bank in person. They will get the paperwork you need and help you do this more efficiently.Make sure to bring with you information about your account, such as your account number, and a government-issued photo ID. You may want to check with your bank before you go to make sure you don't need anything else, such as proof of your address.  If you have any other checks out, or purchases that haven't hit your account yet, you may want to make a list of them so you know how much money to keep in your old account. Despite this, your bank may require you to keep a specific minimum amount of money there for 30 days before they finally close the account.  If you have a joint account, the other account holder typically will need to be present when you make arrangements to close the account.  Generally, it's a good idea to go ahead and set up a new checking account while you're waiting for confirmation that your old checking account ha fully closed. That way you can start the process of switching things over.For example, if you get paid by direct deposit, you may want to start having your checks deposited in your new account rather than your old one.  With some banks, you can go ahead and set up a new checking account online, but you may want to do it in person regardless so you can explain your situation.  Once you have a new checking account, you want to make sure that you don't use your old checks or debit cards by mistake. Not only do you risk a returned check, but your bank may extend the waiting period before your account is closed.Make sure you dispose of old checks and debit cards properly so you're not at risk if they fall into the wrong hands. Use a paper shredder, if you have one, or cut them up into tiny pieces.  If you have any subscriptions or bills set up on automatic payment, you'll want to switch these over from your old account to your new one. Check your most recent account statement and make a list.If you have recurring payments that only happen every few months, you may want to go back several account statements to make sure you have everything.  Your bank also may be able to provide you a list of recurring payments you've authorized. If you have a joint account, you also want to check with the other account holder to make sure they don't have any recurring payments authorized.  Once your bank finally closes your old account, they'll send you a letter confirming the account has been closed, typically with a check for your final balance. You can simply deposit that check in your new account, or you may be able to make arrangements with your bank to have the final balance in your old account automatically transferred to your new one.

"Before you start looking for items, you should know their value and what is considered rare. Unless you are simply collecting to decorate a room, the amount of research you do is likely to correlate with the value of your collection later on.  Go to collectics.com/bookstore_advertising.html to find lists of books on antique advertisements. Advertising memorabilia covers commonly collected items, such as Coca-Cola, match books, gas station signs and more.  Start with books by B.J.

Other good choice include 'Old Magazine Advertisements 1890-1950: Identification & Value Guide' by Richard E. Clear and 'Kovels' Advertising Collectibles Price List' by Terry Kovel.;  , Since you can collect anything from posters, to lunch boxes to bottles or cans, it is a good idea to specialize in 1 or 2 items, learn the industry and then move into other items in the future.  Visit online sellers, such as vintageseekers.com and peruse their inventory of vintage posters. They command high prices, but you will get a good idea of the most valuable items.  This site brings together information on collecting vintage advertising items and it also lists the eBay auctions of advertising items for the week.  You can sign up for a weekly email from the advertising section of Collector's Weekly.  Use your new knowledge at these 1 to 3 day events that are held annually across the country. At fairs like the San Francisco Antiquarian Book, Print and Paper Fair, vintage paper sellers congregate from around the region and the country to sell to collectors.  Look for sellers who specialize in post cards, posters and other prints and ephemera. You will be able to barter for some items in this setting, so be confident if you see a good value.  Many sellers amass a large quantity of tin cans, beer mugs, posters and clothing made for advertising. Barter with these sellers for a reduction in prices.  EBay and Morphy Auctions are just two of the auction sites that regularly deal in antique advertisements. Their holdings change daily and weekly, so check back often to make bids and peruse merchandise.  You will be required to set up an account in order to make bids on a lot of auction items. As well as your personal information and email, you will also need to provide a bank account number or credit card.  Offer to buy them by the piece or pound if you believe there may be some valuable items. Many people are happy to get rid of their old stacks of magazines for a small price.  Some book and paper sellers keep a list of their collectors and go to them when they find new items. Give the seller a list of items you are interested in purchasing.  Catalog the items, take pictures and list their worth. You may want to insure some of your items in case of damage or theft.  Many antique advertisements have been reproduced into posters that sell for $10 to $50.

"Examine the bottom of your coffee cups to identify one that has enough rough space around the bottom. Consider using an older or “least favorite” cup as you may end up making a few marks on the bottom of the cup as you sharpen the knife.  Use only a coffee cup. A teacup is typically too delicate and does not contain the rough bottom required for sharpening.;  , You can sharpen as you go or on an “as needed” basis or you can get everything together that has been dulled and complete the task in one pass.  This technique works for all knife sizes and types (except butter knives) so feel free to apply this method across the board.  Find a smooth, flat surface for this project and make sure the surface is not slippery (or wet). If the coffee cup slips from your hand while you are sharpening the knife, you could slip and cut your hand.  The only way you’ll be able to sharpen the knife is to ensure the coffee cup does not move or slip.  The motion should begin to sharpen the blade edge.  Turn knife over and perform the same motion on the other side of the blade to sharpen the other side.  ","find a coffee cup that has a rough, flat bottom. gather knives that need to be sharpened. turn coffee cup upside down so the bottom faces upward. hold the bottom of the coffee cup with your free hand to keep it firmly in place. place the knife blade against the rough bottom of the cup and slide it back and forth.

"While you are employed, your employer pays a tax to both the federal and state governments.

Write down the places where you applied for jobs, as well as the date.Also write down the name and phone number of any contact person at the business.  Other states will require you to swear that you cannot find work but are nevertheless actively looking.You can usually certify this statement electronically, when you submit your bi-weekly request for benefits.  If you need to prove to a third party that you are currently unemployed, then you can do so by holding onto the receipt that you receive with your unemployment check every two weeks. If you receive direct deposit, then print off any email receipt.  You might also be able to view your payment history at the state’s website.Sometimes, private organizations (like charities) will need to see that you are unemployed before they will extend benefits to you. You can show them your collection of receipts so that they can document the period during which you have been unemployed.  After you apply for benefits, the state agency should contact you and tell you whether or not you qualify for benefits.

"If you’re young, chances are you may be dealing with braces. You shouldn’t avoid kissing someone with braces, but if they’ve just gotten them, it’s best to steer clear until they’ve had time to heal.  When you do go in for the kiss, go slowly. The last thing you want to do is to come in fast and get stuck if you’re both wearing braces.Steer clear of braces with your tongue. While you can still enjoy the pleasure of using your tongue during kissing, you should avoid rubbing your teeth over braces. This could result in an injury, which would be awkward for both parties involved.  Regardless of your age, kissing can be physically demanding. This is particularly true if your partner isn’t the same height as you, which could result in a sore neck from straining to get to their level.  If you are shorter than your partner, try wearing heels or sitting on a bar stool. If you are taller, try leaning against a wall and have your partner stand between your legs to get on even footing.  At some point in your life, you’ll inevitably encounter someone who is less experienced than you at kissing. Luckily, most bad kissers can become good kissers with a little bit of patience and encouragement.  Show your partner what you consider to be good kissing. When the other person starts to follow your lead, respond positively and obviously so that he or she knows you like it.  Never criticize someone’s kissing style. Instead, ask them to try something different with you and show them the way you like to be kissed., One of the most important things to remember is that confidence goes a long way when it comes to kissing. If you feel self-conscious you may act unnatural, which could result in an awkward kiss or no kiss at all.  Think positively about yourself and your abilities. Even if you’re a first timer, visualize yourself as an excellent kisser.  Replace any negative thoughts with positive ones. The more confident you feel on the inside, the more confident you’ll appear to others.If you’re still feeling nervous, take a deep breath and smile. This will help you to relax and will give off a confident vibe.  It's OK to laugh. If something awkward does happen, try to laugh about it. This will help your partner to relax as well. Chances are you can both have a good laugh before trying it again.  ","steer clear of braces. keep your neck from cramping. deal with a bad kisser. be confident. "

"In order to make a baby’s breath crown using the stem of the flowers as the base, you need to choose a bunch of baby’s breath that has a long stem. The stem should be long enough to wrap around your head and fit like a crown., Cut off all of the smaller bunches of baby’s breath that shoot off of the main stem. You can either cut them with scissors or just twist them off using your hands. Set these small bunches aside because they will eventually be attached to the crown., Directly under the small bunch of baby’s breath at the end of the stalk, tape another small bunch of baby’s breath to the stalk. Continue to tape small bunches of baby’s breath to the stalk until it is long enough to fit as a crown.Be sure to tuck in the stems with tape, so that you do not have any stems sticking out of the crown.

"The best way to figure out what should be in your bio or CV is to read the bios of other people who practice ADR. Go to different websites and read 30 to 40 bios.Choose which ones you find effective. Which ones are easiest to read? Also, which ones sound the most professional?  Check how much space each person dedicates to their education, professional experience, and publications.  Also pay attention to layout. Do certifications appear at the beginning or at the end? Is general legal experience mixed in with ADR-specific experience or are they kept separate?;  , If you already have a CV or resume, then make a copy. Delete everything but your name and contact information. If you don’t already have a CV, then find a template online that you can use.  See Write a CV (Curriculum Vitae) for more information.  There are very few generalist mediators or other ADR professionals. Instead, you will increase your chances of standing out by picking a specialty, such as family law or business disputes.Spend some time looking at your experience and deciding what areas you have sufficient experience in.  If you are an attorney, then look at your practice areas. It is common for ADR specialists to work in the same fields that they practice in as attorneys.  You might also need to get more experience in certain fields if you want to practice ADR in them.  Begin creating your own bio. As you work, you may realize that you have certain gaps with respect to education or experience. Make a note of those gaps. You can work on filling them.If you don’t have any ADR specific training, then you can begin by taking a basic introductory mediation or negotiation class.  Contact your local or state bar association to see if any training programs are offered.  You can join many different ADR organizations. You can note your membership on your CV or bio. For example, you can think about joining the following:  ABA Section of Dispute ResolutionA state or local bar association dispute resolution group  , After finishing your bio, you should proof it for clarity and for any grammatical errors or typos. Have another person read it as well so that you will know there are no errors.  You can publish the bio on your website and include a link to a PDF version of the CV as well.  One good way to increase your visibility is to create social media profiles. Social media accounts give you additional online presence. Set up a LinkedIn profile and create a Facebook page.If you are already a practicing attorney with a non-ADR practice, then you should add your dispute resolution credentials to your existing social media profiles.  Remember to keep your social media accounts active. For example, you can provide links to interesting ADR-related stories in the media on your Facebook page.  You can increase your name recognition by writing articles about ADR techniques. You can then publish them in legal journals, bar journals, or online. Choose ADR topics that interest you so that the research and writing will be informative.  For example, you can pick a topic you don’t know a lot about. By writing the article, you increase your own working knowledge and also get your name out in the public.  Avoid paying someone to write an article and then putting your name on it.This is a trend in the legal profession. Unfortunately, you can’t guarantee high quality work by buying an article. Also, you forego learning the details of the subject that comes with writing the article yourself.  You should look for opportunities to give speeches on ADR topics.Doing so will increase your visibility in the profession. It also will allow you to make contacts.  Try to give talks on ADR to groups of people that might be potential clients. For example, if you want to practice environmental arbitration, then give talks to environmental groups, businesses, and your local government. Giving a talk to a group of senior citizens might be less effective.  There are few opportunities to act as a junior mediator or arbitrator. Instead, most mediators and arbitrators work alone. However, always try to seek out opportunities to collaborate with an experienced professional in your field. After they get to know you, they could send work your way or recommend you to other people.  One way to collaborate is to give a presentation along with a more established ADR professional.  You could also work with an experienced professional to get more funding for public mediation or arbitration services. These are good ways to build relationships with more experienced mentors.  If you don’t have much ADR experience, then you might want to get your feet wet with pro bono service. Your local courthouse might have a volunteer mediation program to handle small claims issues.Stop into the courthouse and check to see if there is a program and whether you can join.  Many courts also keep lists of approved ADR specialists who people can hire. If someone contacts the court, they may be referred to someone on the roster. In order to join, you probably need to complete an application in which you talk about your experience.You may want to get substantial pro bono experience under your belt before applying to join a court roster.  Check with any court near you to see about joining. You should look at both state and federal courts, including bankruptcy courts. They all keep rosters.  Business cards, flyers, bookmarks, and handouts are all effective marketing tools. Someone might take one and then hand it to someone else. Also, people tend to keep marketing materials lying around the house or office. If someone needs ADR services, they might look for your promotional materials.  Try to develop a theme or logo that you can use across all materials.This will make them look professional. Also, a logo is instantly recognizable as you.  Create high quality marketing materials. For example, have professional business cards made, and make sure that flyers are glossy and not simply printed on regular paper.  Advertising can take many forms and can reach different audiences. Consider the following forms of advertising, which will help you increase your visibility with the public:  Google Adwords. This is a pay-per-click advertising system that allows you to target certain cities, regions, or countries.Phone book ads. You can put your name in the Yellow Pages and also buy an ad. The ad does not need to be large. Instead, it can include one or two lines that identify your specialty.Online websites. You can advertise with websites such as Mediate.com.  Newspaper ads. People still read newspapers. You can purchase a small ad in a local newspaper. Try to run it regularly, since people have to see an ad multiple times to remember your name.  An elevator pitch is a 20-30 second speech where you sell yourself. It’s great for networking events where you don’t have a lot of time to make an impression. Nothing is worse than floundering around as you try to describe your ADR practice. Your pitch should consist of the following:your name  your business name  a tag line  two sentences in which you explain why someone should choose you  , Once you identify your specialty, you can begin marketing by meeting people, face-to-face. It is important not to sit behind your desk, assuming clients will come to you because you ran some Google ads. Instead, identify where your potential clients are likely to congregate.If you specialize in business mediation, then you can meet people at small business associations and gatherings, such as the Chamber of Commerce.  If you are specializing in construction arbitration, for example, then you might want to give a talk to a contractor’s association, discussing litigation issues and how arbitration can resolve them.  Sometimes, the people who will feed you clients will be lawyers. For example, divorce attorneys might recommend you to clients who want to mediate disputes. You can meet attorneys at bar association events.  Choose two or three people who are doing well in ADR in your specialty and analyze what marketing they are using. Are they purchasing ads in journals or magazines? Do they use Google ads?  Try to build your marketing strategy using the same techniques that have helped propel the competition to the top.  You can also talk personally to other mediators and ask them what has worked in terms of marketing.They might be hesitant, since you are a competitor. If so, then you can talk with other ADR professionals who don’t work in your niche.  If you are already a practicing attorney, then you probably know a lot of people—former clients, other attorneys, and business professionals. You should let them know that you now offer ADR services.  You can send an email explaining that you have expanded your business. Attach a flyer that explains the services you offer.  Better yet, you could reconnect over a lunch. You never know who will have an issue they need to resolve using ADR. Seeing people in person is usually a better way to make an impression.  You can also market by drafting a press release. Keep it short: three paragraphs or less. You can explain that you have started a mediation practice and say something unique about it.For example, you might be the only mediator practicing environmental mediation in your community.  You can send the press release to the business editor of your local newspaper.  You don’t commit to a marketing plan for all time. Instead, you should constantly reassess it and make necessary changes.In the beginning, you can reassess after every month.  Try something new. If your current marketing isn’t working, then try something different at least once a week or even every day.  For example, you could send out emails to attorneys asking to set up a lunch. Or you might just want to send them some promotional materials so that your name will be familiar if they are ever looking to hire an ADR professional.

"Watching a movie is a way to relax and have fun, not a torture. Nobody can force you.  Even if the movie is based on true events, remember that it is probably based on what little event or what someone believed would happen in this 'true event'.  Make sure that person will not torment you afterwards. For example, many people watch it with their older siblings which sometimes, wouldn't be the best idea. Also, we know that some people say that PG-13 movies are less scary - well, that is not always the case. Take The Grudge or Insidious both known as two of the scariest movies. Try something that isn't extreme - get introduced to the horror genre by maybe seeing comedy-horror or drama-horror. Look for that other genre that interests you that you can combine with horror.  Hug the person you are watching the movie if you can. Anyway, you should have the possibility to establish a physical contact with this person. Have pillows and blankets to hug too!  , Even though some horror fans may want to watch movies in the dark with surround sound, you definitely should not do that if you are afraid of being scared. Watch movies in the daytime, turn on the lights, open the window to let sunlight in. Also, avoid surround sound, because it sends you all the background suspenseful music louder than the actual people talking.  Scary movies are made for suspense, so you will not relax totally.  , It tends to make you even more jumpy.  ,, Pausing the movie helps remind you that it is just a movie.  Laugh about things, or funny faces, or anything.  Get yourself some food and a drink; this is very useful. Read a short advertisement in the newspaper, check your mailbox for mail, or play a quick game of sudoku. This can divert your mind from the movie temporarily so you can continue watching it.  Do not stay in a room alone or read something related to horror. If possible, discuss the movie with someone. Another awesome thing to do is go to the 'Special 'Features' in the main menu and look at how everything was so fake.  ,  ","decide if you really want to watch it. remember that you are just watching a movie. the first time you watch a horror movie, make sure it's not so terrible, and watch it with a person who is not as terrified as you. sit comfortably because you might jump when something pops out, and you don't want to be uncomfortable. don't create a scary atmosphere. before you start watching, remember that during the movie, you will have strong emotions. press play. , don't try fake yelling. breathe normally. , try to remember all the steps mentioned above. , make sure you have access to the remote control to stop the movie when you can. comment on funny parts of the movie. take breaks when you come a suspenseful part. after the movie, watch relaxing tv program. if the movie did not result so terribly scary, laugh about yourself being so scared! , if the movie scared you a lot, and is tormenting you day after day and won't make you sleep, talk to someone you trust and remember - it is just a movie.

"Make it a part of your daily routine of self-care, as you would with meals, hygiene, and exercise. As you face triggers throughout the day, allow yourself the ability to confront the resulting stress later, at a time of your choosing, rather than be overcome by it in the moment.Devote 15 to 20 minutes each day, at the same hour, to create structure. Allow plenty of time between your worry session and your bedtime to avoid bringing your worries to bed with you.  Jot down triggers as they happen. Create a to-do list to go over later, during your session. Assure yourself in the moment that the situation will in fact be addressed.  Keep a journal. Commit your troubles to paper so you don't have to keep them bottled up. Use this time to create lists of steps that you can take to resolve issues.  As your problem-solving skills become more ingrained with repeated practice during your sessions, apply them in the moment to resolve situations that demand immediate attention.  It can be easy to see certain self-care practices as expendable or put them last on your list. When you're busy, overwhelmed, or tired, it's easy to think 'I'll just skip yoga class today,' or 'I can shower tomorrow,' or, 'It's not really that important that I meditate. Getting this other stuff done is more important.' Don't think of your stress-reducing activities as optional. Schedule time to do them daily and stick to it.  Identify things that help reduce your stress, such as yoga, meditation, exercising, deep breathing, and schedule a time to do it every day.  Managing stress is all about balance and prevention (consistent de-stressing) so it's important that it's scheduled and made a priority.  Understand that stress and anxiety often stems from overthinking the past or the future. Recognize that the past is just that: past. Expect the future to be shaped in part by your current actions. Center your attention on what you can do here, in the moment, to improve your situation.To reorient yourself to the present, quit what you are doing. Breathe deeply and slowly. Expand your senses to note your environment. Observe what is going on around you instead of what’s going on inside your head. Close your eyes if necessary and focus solely on smells and sounds.  Expect chronic issues to distort your outlook. Determine whether you are viewing situations objectively or if you are perceiving them through a biased point of view. Resist viewing situations as being either black or white. Perceive them as shades of gray instead. Note the positive as well as the negative to ensure a more balanced view of the world.Treat each situation as an isolated incident, rather than one link of an unbreakable chain that is doomed to repeat itself. For example, don't assume that all future relationships are doomed to fail just because your last partner broke up with you.  Break each situation down into separate components and analyze each in turn. For instance, if you are stressing out over your job because it won’t lead to advancement, don’t overlook its positive aspects, such as its proximity to home, your relationships with coworkers, and the skillsets that you can now include in your resume when seeking other employment.  Avoid assuming the worst. Say your boss calls you into their office when it isn’t their habit to do so. Think of ALL the possible topics they might want to discuss, rather than focusing exclusively on negative ones like, “You’re fired!”  , Avoid holding yourself accountable for other people’s choices. Where your own actions are concerned, allow yourself the freedom of choice. Don't try to live your life by a single code of unbreakable rules, since this is often impossible and only creates more stress when you end up breaking those rules. When you do make mistakes, view each one as a single action that you once took, rather than internalizing it as a definition of who you are as a person.When analyzing a situation, use verbs to describe what happened to better identify possible solutions or alternatives.  For example, think, “I missed my last bill payment because I worked three double-shifts in a row and forgot all about it due to exhaustion,” rather than, “I missed my last payment because I’m forgetful.”  , If you find that you are unable to cope with stress and anxiety on your own, seek treatment. Speak with your doctor about a referral, ask trusted friends and families about therapists who may have treated them, or search online for a practice that seems to suit you. Expect counseling to possibly utilize one or more of the following techniques:Discussing your feelings and personal history.  Sharpening problem-solving skills.  Supervised exposure to simulated and real-world triggers of anxiety.  Rebuilding your outlook on life to reduce negative mindsets.  Recognizing and mastering your body’s responses to stress.  Practicing relaxation techniques.  ","schedule a daily “worry session.” if you experience anxiety and stress frequently, set aside a portion of each day to face them. make self-care a priority. concentrate on the present. quit thinking in absolutes. give yourself a break. seek professional help.

"In this case, a tampon gives you the freedom to do any activity such as swimming and diving. Whereas, a pad can make you feel comfortable but it restricts you to only a few activities. A pad is made to absorb liquid from your menstrual flow so if you try to go swimming, it will end up being swelled as a balloon!  Tampons are made for people who have a slightly heavier flow. Once the tampon is inside of your vagina, it sucks up liquid making sure you have no leaks! Some tampons are designed with a leak skirt to prevent those 'oops' moments!

The white clarifies your hair by helping to remove any buildup. The egg also has protein in it, which strengthens your hair. The result is hair that looks very shiny after just one treatment. Here's how to do it:  Beat one egg in a small bowl.  Wet your hair.  Pour the egg over your head. Use a wide-tooth comb to comb it to the tips of your hair.  Let it sit in your hair for at least 15 minutes.  Shampoo your hair as normal. Rinse with cold water for maximum shine.;  , Apple cider vinegar is quickly catching on as an all-natural hair conditioner and gloss booster. It balances your hair's pH level, clarifies your strands and leaves your hair feeling soft. Once your hair dries, it will no longer smell like vinegar. Follow these steps to make an ACV treatment:Shampoo your hair as usual, but skip the conditioner.  Pour a mixture of 1 tablespoon ACV and 1 tablespoon water over your head. Comb it through to your tips. Very long hair ma require 2 or 3 tablespoons.  Let it sit for five minutes, then rinse your hair with cold water at the end of your shower.  Avocado has natural fats that nourish your hair and add shine. Using a ripe avocado will make it easier to spread the mixture into your hair.Try an avocado mask when your hair is dry and in need of a moisturizing boost.  Mash an avocado until smooth. You can also use a blender to process it.  Wet your hair.  Spread the avocado from your roots to your tips.  Let it sit in your hair for at least 15 minutes.  Shampoo your hair as normal. Rinse with cold water.  Honey attracts moisture and has clarifying properties. This combination makes it perfect for adding shine to dull hair. Raw honey is the most nourishing, but any type of honey works fine. To make a honey mask,Mix 1/4 cup honey and 1/4 cup warm water.  Wet your hair.  Comb the mixture into your hair.  Let it sit for 15 minutes or more.  Shampoo your hair as normal. Rinse with cold water.  If your hair isn't shiny because it's dry, dull and frizzy, a deep conditioning treatment should put things right. You can get a store-bought deep conditioner or make your own using coconut or olive oil. Once a week, follow these steps to deep condition your hair:  Wet your hair.  Comb 1 to 3 tablespoons of coconut oil or olive oil from your roots to your tips. Cover your hair with a shower cap or plastic wrap.  Let it sit for up to 30 minutes.  Shampoo your hair.

"Studies have shown that students who use flash cards to study for exams score significantly higher than those who do not, making this a cheap means of yielding high returns.You will need to buy either 3x5 or 4x6 unlined index cards, and a pencil, pen or marker that won’t show through on the other side after writing. Begin by writing a short question on one side of the card and the answer on the other side. Select the first card, read the question and answer it. Flip the card to see if you answered it correctly.  Keep all of your flash cards in one stack instead of separating them into smaller stacks. Doing this initiates the spacing effect, which enhances recall and retention.  After you have gone through them several times at spaced time intervals, separate the cards that you consistently get right and focus on those that you do not.  Concept cards differ from flash cards in that the focus is not on individual facts but, instead, on the interconnectedness of facts and ideas, of concepts, and are particularly helpful when prepping for essay exams and finals.As with flash cards, buy either 3x5 or 4x6 unlined index cards and a pencil, pen or marker that won’t show through on the other side after you write. On one side, write a key idea, term, name, event or process from your notes. On the other, write the definition of that word, keeping it brief, and list 3-5 concepts related to it. Use your concept cards to quiz yourself on each identified word you wrote on the front of your cards.  Concepts related to the identified words might include examples, reasons why the identified word is important, related issues, sub-categories and so forth.  For both flash cards and concept cards, pick up a few index file boxes or cases/holders to store your cards. The cases/holders, particularly, come in a variety of colors and can be matched with the colors you chose for your subjects’ folders and notebooks, if you went that route in organizing your notes.  You can also carry one or both sets of cards with you and use them in your down time, such as when you’re waiting at the doctor’s office, while riding the bus or between classes.  Self-testing is one of the most highly effective study strategies you can employ and should be done regularly. It forces your brain to retrieve information and strengthens the neural pathways to memory storage.Taking your lecture notes, create questions based upon the material in each lecture. You will want to create multiple choice questions, true/false questions, short answer questions, fill-in-the blank questions and essay questions. Set your practice test aside for a few days, then take it and repeat this process periodically throughout the term for each test.  After the first exam in a particular course, you often, though not always, will have a good idea of the test format your teacher prefers and uses. If the test was all multiple choice, for example, consider creating more multiple choice questions from your lecture notes for that course.  When constructing your practice test questions, try to anticipate and construct questions that might show up on the real exam. Look in your notes for cause/effect relationships, examples and hypotheticals, definitions, dates, lists and diagrams.  After your first exam, look at the questions you missed. Go back to your notes and see if that material was in your notes. Perhaps it was in your text, or perhaps it was in your notes but you didn’t consider it as important as your teacher obviously did. Use this insight to adjust not only your practice tests but also your note taking and studying in general.  ","transform lecture notes into flash cards. create concept cards from your lecture notes. create practice self-tests from your lecture notes. "
"A double boiler is the best way to melt chocolate, since it lowers the risk of overcooking. If you don't have one, you can make it as follows:  Add a little water to a saucepan and bring to a simmer.  Cover the pan with a bowl. The bowl should be above the level of the water.  Place 2½ cups (300 g) chocolate in the bowl and stir until melted. You can use any type of chocolate for this.  You can use a microwave instead, but this can cause burning or separating. Zap on the lowest power setting in 20-second bursts. Stir in between and repeat until melted.  Put on oven mitts and remove the bowl from heat. Pour the chocolate over 6 cups (150 g) crispy rice cereal. Stir until the cereal is completely coated. Optionally, mix in candy, raisins, or other toppings.  Spoon these into paper-lined cupcake tins, or directly onto a baking sheet covered in parchment paper.  Wax paper or grease-proof paper will work fine.  Move the mini-cakes to the fridge for about 30 minutes, or until hard. You can eat immediately or keep them in the fridge another day or two.  Ingredients in chocolate sometimes 'bloom' to the surface when cooked, moistened, or cooled. This creates harmless white blotches on the surface.

"It's important that you first rule out the need to immediately see a doctor. Usually neck pain is due to tension or strain in the muscles, but you should seek attention right away if:  The pain is accompanied by any numbness.  You experience any accompanying numbness in the hands or arms.  You have a shooting pain into your shoulder and down your arm.;  , Neck pain that is not caused by a serious injury can oftentimes be treated at home by applying soothing warmth and anti-inflammatory cold.Holding a heating pad or a bottle of heated water on the affected area for 15-20 minutes at a time can help relax the neck muscles, easing tension and pain, as well as increasing the blood flow and providing plenty of nutrients to the muscles, aiding the healing process. Moist heat such as a hot shower can help, and some people find it useful to apply constant low heat with store brand heat wraps.Alternate with cold. Use an ice pack for 15-20 minutes at a time. The cold helps decrease the inflammation in muscles caused by injury or strain, and can help lessen the pain. , Use ibuprofen or acetaminophen to temporarily lessen the pain, always following correct dosage. These medications help decrease inflammation of the muscles temporarily. However, over the counter medications should only be used as temporary solutions, not daily remedies.  Overuse of over the counter pain medications can lead to liver or other organ damage.Regular or everyday use of over the counter pain medications can lead to Medication Overuse Headache (MOH). This occurs when a person regularly takes medications that they don't need as a preventative rather than responsive measure, and can lead to an increase in pain, or dependence on medications.  ","know when to see a doctor (such as a doctor of medicine (md) or a doctor of osteopathic medicine (do). apply heat and cold. take anti-inflammatory medicine. "
"This method is for slinkies that aren't tangled, but have developed bent coils or 'kinks' that refuse to line up with the other coils. Some plastic slinky kinks can be molded back into place when heated, but this won't always work and could even melt your toy if you're not careful. Metal slinkies are much harder to bend back, so only try it if you have time to spare and really don't want to buy a replacement.  Fill a pot with enough water to cover the slinky. Heat it on the stove alone, without the slinky in it.You do not want the water to boil, but keep heating it until it becomes quite hot, perhaps just beginning to steam.  You could microwave a bowl of water instead, or heat water in the kettle and pour it into a pot.  Turn off the heat once the water is hot. Never keep heating the water after the slinky is in it, or the slinky could melt and ruin both itself and the container it's in.  Put on rubber gloves to protect your hands, and lower the slinky into the hot water. Leave it there for a couple minutes.  After a couple minutes in the hot water, take the slinky out while wearing gloves. If the slinky was heated hot enough, you should be able to mold it gently into place, pressing the kinked coil down where it should go.  If you have a cardboard tube or other cylinder that's slightly smaller than the slinky, you can wrap the slinky coils around it to get the right position., If the slinky is still stiff and can't be bent, heat the water hotter and try again. Heating the slinky too much can make it a permanently ruined mess, so increase the temperature slowly and keep a close eye on the water. Never heat the slinky directly.  Immediately after bending it back into place, place the coiled slinky underneath a flat book. Leave it there for several hours, or even overnight, to compress the slinky into position.  If the book keeps falling off, try using a large, thin children's book instead. Place a small, heavy object on the center of the children's book, directly over the slinky.  Don't use a book that's so heavy or so wide that it knocks the slinky over and crushes it.  If hot water doesn't work to repair the slinky, you could line a baking sheet with tin foil, put the kinked slinky in a stack on top of it and heat it in a 250ºF (121ºC) oven for about 10 minutes.Use oven mitts to pull it out and bend it back into place, if it hasn't settled on its own. This is risky, as some plastic slinkies could melt.  If all else fails, use a pair of wire cutters to cut the slinky at either end of the kink. You can try to reattach the good parts using rubber cement or super glue, but it will be difficult to attach them at the right angle. More likely, you'll end up with two permanently separated smaller slinkies.  The cut ends may be sharp. Try covering them with several small pieces of packing tape to protect your fingers.  ","know your chances for plastic or metal slinkies. heat a pot of water. turn off the heat. while wearing gloves, put the slinky into the hot water. remove the slinky and bend it into place. try again with hotter water if you didn't succeed. press the slinky flat with a book. heat the slinky in an oven. cut the slinky apart.

"That is, you are trying to sell a story, so you want to create a vivid image of it for the the producers or executives. Treat your pitch like a story your telling a group of friends.  Speak with the correct inflections. Don't downplay a dramatic part of your pitch by mumbling through it. When you're practicing giving your pitch, add inflections where necessary to emphasize the story. Get louder and faster as the story gets more exciting and softer, though still clear-spoken when the story enters a tender moment.Don't be afraid to use hand gestures.

Try not to step on any toes. That is, you can name a few people who would be good in the main character's role, but you should mention that you are open to other ideas, since the executive will have a better idea of who's available and who's trending., Movie executives are busy people, so they may need to take a call or text during the pitch. Let them take the time they need, and don't get flustered. Just resume where you left off., If you get lost, you definitely want a backup.

"The first step towards overcoming learned dependency is believing that you can. When they arise, push your doubts out of your mind. Think about the possibilities instead.If you have a hard time believing you can change, trick yourself into it by pretending. Tell yourself that you’ll just make a few small changes in your life and see what happens. Act like its not big deal.  Identify some bite-sized steps you can take towards reclaiming control over your life. No change is too small – right now, the point is to convince yourself that you really do have the freedom to make your own choices.Don’t try to make a big change right away, or you may end up overwhelmed and frustrated.  Maybe you could get a new haircut, have something different for breakfast, or rearrange your bedroom.  Realize that failure is only temporary.

"It is both expensive and inefficient to monitor every square inch of your house, so you need to prioritize what areas you want to watch the most. Draw up a rough diagram of your house or print out the blueprints and note where you might want to place cameras. When you are done, check out each location to make sure it is not blocked by anything and provides the best view possible. You may want cameras for:  Front and back doors.  Off-Street Windows  Large common spaces (kitchen, living room etc.)  Driveways  Porches  Stairways;  , You can buy each piece individually, but it is generally cheaper and easier to buy bundled security systems. At a minimum your system should have 1-3 cameras, a DVR (digital video recorder), appropriate wiring (siamese and BNC cables), and power cords. Unless you are choosing to monitor a large area, wireless cameras with wall mounting should cover your needs.  Basic Home Security: Get a package with 2-3 outdoor cameras (to monitor doors), and a DVR with at least 3 days of recording time.  Monitoring Valuables/Young Children: 1-3 indoor wireless cameras can cover a small room effectively and stream the footage right to your computer.  Once you know how many cameras you need, you'll need to think about what specific cameras you want. A home surveillance system can cost anywhere from a few hundred dollars to well over a thousand, so make sure you consider the type of cameras you need before buying -- the features below should be clearly labeled on the box. While you can buy all of the parts separately, buying a full 'surveillance set' is usually cheaper and easier to install.  Wireless vs. Wired: Wireless cameras are easy to set-up without drilling or running cables through your house, but the quality can be sub-par the further they get away from the receiver. If you are covering a big area, go wired, but most houses find wireless and easier set-up process.  Indoor or Outdoor: Cameras that are not made to be placed outside will quickly break when exposed to rain and humidity, so be sure to choose accordingly.  Motion Sensing: Some cameras will only record when they notice motion, saving lots of space and energy while only capturing footage when someone is in the room.  Remote Viewing: Many high-end cameras offer the ability to stream their footage to your phone or laptop anywhere in the world, making it possible to check out your house through a provided program or app., In order to store and view your footage, you need a Digital Video Recorder (DVR). This device receives all of the video feeds and broadcasts them onto a monitor, usually a computer screen or small TV. DVRs have a variety of memory capacities that allow them to store a certain amount of video, from hundreds of hours to one day's worth of footage.  If you buy a complete surveillance set the DVR is usually included with the camera.  Network Video Recorders (NVR) and analog recorders (VCRs), also available for purchase, work the same way as a DVR, using an internet signal (NVR) or blank tapes (VCR) to record instead of a digital hard-drive. The following installation tips will work here as well.  Make sure your cables, DVR, cameras, and monitor all work by connecting each one before you install anything.

"It’s important that you only visit a DMV office within your county. Since vehicle registration is county-specific, a DMV in another county (even if it’s technically nearer to your residence) will be unable to help you. This information should be accessible by looking at a map.  To find your county, you can also use an online map service, such as Google maps.

"Studies show that when an employee feels excluded, they may engage in acting out behaviors to get noticed. Examples might include cutting co-workers out of projects, cheating, lying, or aggressively competing. If you are tempted to behave this way, think about the possible repercussions first. Acting out will only make you feel more excluded, and it could jeopardize your job too., Chances are you could be disengaged from work because you no longer feel challenged. Simply because your job description doesn't entail any lofty accomplishments or goals doesn't mean you can’t strive for them. Create your own personal goals to work towards.

Remember to keep anything you remove so you can replace it when it's time to move. If you swap out hardware, blinds, or lighting, keep the original someplace safe.  Your landlord probably went with the most inexpensive option. Find hardware that fits into your design scheme and replace the old, cheap ones with something that is more 'you' (again, remember to keep the original hardware to put back when you move out!).  ","find out what you're allowed to change. if you are not allowed to paint your room, get creative!, trade out hardware like cabinet knobs, light switch plates and doorknobs. "

"If the child faces immediate harm, then you should call emergency services. In the United States, you should call 911.  In Australia, call 000 or 112 on a cell phone.  In Canada, you can call 911.  In the U.K., call 112 or 999.;  , For non-emergencies, you should call Child Protective Services (CPS). You can look in your phone book or search on the Internet. Type “child protective services” and then “your state or territory.” A website should pull up.  Many CPS offices run hotlines you can call to report the abuse. These numbers should be listed on their website.  If you can’t find any number listed, then check the Child Welfare website. It has website addresses and toll-free numbers for each state in the United States., The Childhelp National Child Abuse Hotline is a national hotline in the United States available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.They can take your report of suspected abuse or neglect and then forward the information to the appropriate state agency.  The hotline number is 1-800-422-4453.  All calls to the Childhelp National Child Abuse Hotline are anonymous.  CPS may give you the option of reporting anonymously. Even if you can’t report anonymously, the agency will probably keep your report confidential. However, your identity may be revealed if legal proceedings are started against the foster parent.  Accordingly, think how comfortable you would be testifying in court. If the state knows your identity, they will probably want you to testify. You should identify yourself if you have helpful documentation of the abuse or neglect and are not afraid of the abuser.  However, you might want to remain anonymous if you are afraid of the abuser or live with him or her.  Once you find the appropriate number to call, you should gather the following information, as you will need to provide it to the appropriate authorities:the child’s name, age, and address  the names of the foster parents  any siblings in the home  a description of the situation  any injuries, medical problems, or behavioral issues  a short explanation of how you came to suspect child abuse or neglect  , Some people hesitate to report suspected child abuse because they think they might get in trouble if they are wrong. However, you should realize that state laws protect you so long as you report the suspected abuse in “good faith.”“Good faith” essentially means you didn’t knowingly file a false report. To protect yourself, sit down and write out what signs of child abuse you observed.  You may be a mandated reporter. Many countries have laws requiring certain professionals to report suspected abuse. For example, doctors, teachers, clergy, and social workers are often mandated reporters.If you fail to report abuse as a mandated reporter, then you could be prosecuted. In Kansas, for example, failure to report is a Class B misdemeanor, which carries as a punishment a $1,000 fine or six months in jail.In at least 18 states, everyone is required by law to report suspected abuse., Your job as a mandated reporter is not to perform an in-depth investigation. Instead, you need to gather the minimum amount of information necessary to trigger filing a report.Generally, states require that you have facts sufficient to “cause you to suspect” abuse.  You can get this information by asking the child questions. For example, if a child comes to school dirty all the time and poorly dressed, you can ask, “Do your foster parents help get you dressed?” If the child says, “No, they aren’t around,” then you have reason to suspect neglect.  Extensive questioning can be counter-productive. For example, your questions could subtly alter the child’s recollection of facts. For this reason, gather only as much evidence as necessary.  You need to make an oral report first. After making the oral report, you can then fill out any necessary forms. You generally must file the report within a certain amount of time, e.g., 48 hours of making an oral report., Your state should publish a form for mandated reporters to use. You should get the form by talking to your supervisor. Alternately, you can look for the form online.  If you still can’t find the form, then contact CPS. They should have the form for you to fill out.  Each state’s form will be different. However, you generally will need to provide the following information, so you should gather it ahead of time before sitting down to fill out the report:information about the child, including name, address, date of birth, sex, ethnicity, disability, and languages spoken  the child’s current location and address  the child’s school, classroom, and grade  information about other children in the home  information about the foster parents, including names, contact information, date of birth, sex, ethnicity, and languages spoken  your contact information, as well as information about your relationship to the child  the extent and nature of the injury or neglect  information about any incident you observed, including the date, time, and location of the incident  any other related concerns, such as domestic violence, gang involvement, or substance abuse  what actions you have taken to treat or shelter the child  any concerns for a social worker’s safety  , The form should tell you where to mail or fax it. Be sure to send it to the correct address. Also keep a copy for your own records.  Foster parents may leave children unattended, which is neglect. Be on the lookout for the following, which are indicators of physical neglect:medical needs are not being attended to  the child is regularly unsupervised  the child is routinely hungry, emaciated, or suffers from significant weight change  the child is inappropriately dressed  the child’s hygiene is poor  , Sometimes children will manifest signs of neglect in their behavior. Although the child will look in perfect physical health, his or her behavior may signal a deeper problem. Look for the following:the child regularly falls asleep in class or is otherwise tired  the child begs from classmates  the child steals or hoards food  the child tells you that no foster parent is home  , Pay attention to the following physical indicators, as they can be signs that foster parents have physically abused the child. If you notice any of these signs, then write down information, such as the location on the child’s body:bruises, welts, or loop marks  bruises behind the ears  any bite mark made by an adult  missing clumps of hair  unexplained burns  unexplained punctures, cuts, or abrasions  chipped teeth and swollen lips  parallel marks on cheeks or around the forehead  puncture wounds  , Sometimes, physical abuse manifests itself in behavioral problems. Although you might not see bruising or cuts, the child acts in a way that raises your concern. Look for the following behaviors:the child acts in self-destructive ways or self-mutilates  the child becomes skittish when touched or otherwise avoids physical contact  the child exhibits behavior extremes, such as being aggressive or overly withdrawn  the child comes to school late or stays late as if afraid of going home  the child complains of being sore  the child moves uncomfortably, as if suffering from a physical injury  the child shows lack of impulse control, such as inappropriate outbursts  , Foster parents can also emotionally abuse a child. Emotional abuse can take many forms, such as using abusive language or name calling, withholding emotional support, or isolating the child from friends. Look for the following symptoms of emotional abuse:the child is overly-affectionate toward strangers  the child lacks confidence or appears anxious  the foster parent and child do not appear to have a close relationship  the child is overly aggressive or nasty toward other children or toward animals  the child has extreme outbursts and cannot control strong emotions  , Children may also be sexually abused. Sexual abuse has its own unique signs. Look for the following:pain, bruises, or bleeding in the genital area  sexually transmitted diseases  pregnancy, if under 12 years of age  frequent urinary or yeast infections  sexual behaviors or references that are unusual for the child’s age  promiscuous or seductive behavior  suicide attempts (particularly teenagers)  ","call emergency services if the child is endangered. find your local child protective services. get the hotline number. contact childhelp instead. decide if you want to report anonymously. report the abuse. don’t delay. gather sufficient information to make the report. call cps first. find the appropriate form. gather necessary information. submit the form. identify physical signs of physical neglect. identify behavioral indicators of physical neglect. recognize physical indicators of physical abuse. recognize behavioral indicators of physical abuse. identify signs of emotional abuse. identify signs of sexual abuse.

"Crush or cut the frame into small pieces, and fry in a non stick pan with just a little oil.  When browned, add 1 cup of water and if desired some diced carrot and onion and some chopped herbs. Simmer until reduced to 50% or half a cup of stock.  You may do other parts of the recipe while the stock cooks.;  , Use minimal oil as fat will come from the chicken skin. Brown each piece evenly, then put aside.  They should be lightly golden brown, but the bacon should not be crisp. Pour out most of the fat and return the chicken to the pan. Add the brandy to the pan to deglaze.  If you use gas and do not wish to flame the brandy, turn off the flame before adding the brandy and cover immediately with a lid. Flaming the brandy should only be done by experienced cooks with adequate ventilation. If you use electric and wish to flame the brandy, pour in the liquid into the hot pan and use a long lighter such as a barbecue lighter, or a long match taking all safety precautions.  Cover with the stock and red wine, ensure all pieces are coated and ideally submerged. Add the bouquet garni, garlic and cover with a lid. Simmer for at least 1 hour.  After this time, heat up a new pan with 1 tablespoon of the reserved fat. If you don't have a large pan, cook in small batches so the mushrooms will not stew. Briskly fry the mushrooms and add these to the chicken. Stir well and cover again.  For more flavour, add some chopped red shallots to the mushrooms.  Ideally use 1 tablespoon of the remaining chicken and bacon fat if available or use butter. Cream the two together to a paste and stir into the chicken. Simmer 10 minutes more or until thickened and there is no floury texture. You may also use cornflour which cooks out much quicker, but does add a different texture to the sauce.  Some purists will not add any thickening agent other than cockerel or chicken blood (which is both hard to get and expensive), so if you do not wish to use any thickening agent, transfer some of the sauce to another pan and boil briskly until reduced, then add back to the chicken. This can however make the end result more stronger tasting and salty.  Ideally with pasta or potatoes, as well as fresh peas and spring vegetables.

"Take a plain piece of paper and place the letter, check, or whatever else you’re mailing in the middle. Fold the paper into three or four parts, depending on the size of the envelope.  A similar option is to place your content inside a greeting card and then place the card in the envelope., Security envelopes will have a lining substance that makes it more opaque. These envelopes usually have unique colored patterns.They can be found at any stationary store or office supply store and should only be a dollar or so more expensive than regular envelopes.  Another simple way to prevent people from reading through the envelope is to use two. In addition to your regular envelope, get another one with slightly larger dimensions and place the first one inside of it.  ","wrap the content in paper. use a security envelope. use two envelopes.

"A divorce can upend children’s lives. If you introduce a bunch of new, extremely restrictive (or extremely lax) rules following a divorce, you’ll only add to their stress, confusion, and unhappiness. Once your divorce is finalized, carry over as many of the rules as possible from the time before you and your spouse divorced.If you do decide to change a rule, then make sure that you evaluate your reasons for the rule change. For example, if you decide to change your child's bedtime, then consider whether you are changing the bedtime because your child is getting older, or if you are changing the bedtime to be the “cool” parent.;  , You and your ex might not agree on all the rules. Even many parents who are not divorced often disagree on the rules for their kids. But think about each rule carefully and recognize the difference between an important rule (like “No playing near the street by yourself”) and a trivial rule (like “No television after 8:00”). Let your ex know that you expect consistency with these more serious rules. Learn to compromise on rules that don’t directly affect your child’s health and well-being., If you allow your kids to do something that your ex doesn’t allow (or vice versa), they will come to resent the parent who restricts their freedom. Being consistent between households is also important to avoid confusion for your kids.Talk to your ex about specific rules for your kids that you believe you should both share between households. Ask your ex if they have any suggestions for rules, too. Listen to their ideas and implement the rules in your own household if you agree.  Not only should expectations and privileges be the same for your kids no matter where they are, but they should also get rewarded the same way. So if your ex brings your kids back in the evening and says he or she promised them they could stay up a bit late tonight because they helped clean up the house, you should honor that. Likewise, if your ex informs you that your child has been naughty and therefore is not permitted television for the rest of the day, let your child know that their behavior has consequences in your house, too., It’s easy to give in to a child’s complaints. But if you do, your kids will only push you for more and more leeway on the rules. Soon enough, they’ll be in control, and that’s a situation you don’t want to be in. Be firm, clear, and consistent when applying the rules and administering discipline.Whether you want to make them happy or just want them to stop nagging, you’ll probably have moments of weakness and give in to their child. But you should try to limit these occasions as much as possible, and let your kids know that you’re making a special exception. This way, they will understand that they should not expect you to agree to, for instance, staying up late or watching an extra hour of TV every time they ask for it.  Make sure that the things you give in to are acceptable. For example, if you have a “no soda” rule, then allowing your child to have a cola on the weekend might be acceptable. However, allowing your child to skip doing their homework would not be an acceptable thing to give in to your child about.  If you and your ex are not on good terms, or are tense around each other, your kids will notice. And if you criticize your ex directly to your kids, they will definitely notice. They might repeat these criticisms to your ex, causing the relationship between you to deteriorate. When you and your ex aren’t getting along, it can be difficult to coordinate child care, including disciplinary issues.If you find your ex really repulsive, spend as little time around them as possible. Call them if you need to talk, and wait until your kids are out of earshot.  Always be polite to your ex, even if they aren’t polite to you.  ","keep the rules relatively stable. be flexible when developing rules with your ex. apply consistent discipline between households. follow through with discipline between households. be consistent within your household. maintain a positive relationship with your ex.

"Put a few teaspoons of water in the bowl on top of the diffuser. Light the candle under the diffuser and then sprinkle a few drops of your chosen essential oil into the water. The scent of the oil will waft gently around the room.  You can also use a reed diffuser to disperse the scent of the essential oil., Light a candle and wait a minute or two to allow a small amount of wax to melt. Blow out the candle and add a couple of drops of essential oil to the melted wax, before carefully relighting the candle. Take care not to drop any oil on the wick as essential oils are highly flammable.  If you don’t have a diffuser or candles handy, you can just fill a small bowl or saucer with boiling water and then add a few drops of essential oil. The steam will waft the aroma of the oil around the room. Just make sure that you place the dish somewhere out of reach of pets and children.

"One way to get Legendaries is to play in the Arena mode. Arena mode is unlocked using 150 in-game gold or by paying $1.99 USD. You will have the chance to gain arcane dust which you can use to craft Legendaries or you may even get a legendary as a reward for winning, if you get 8 or more wins. When playing in the Arena, level up your key as high as possible. This will increase the amount of loot you get and will increase your chances of getting a pack that has a legendary in it.  One thing to keep in mind is that Arena can reward legendaries from any set, so it isn't as helpful for trying to get a specific legendary, and if you can't average more than about 3 wins per arena run, it probably isn't worth it.;  , Go into the crafting screen via the “My Collections” tab on the main page. Click “Crafting” at the top of the screen to be shown all possible cards you can craft. Sort through these until you find the legendary you are interested in creating and click it. If you have enough dust saved up (1600 Arcane Dust per legendary card) you will be able to create your own legendary.If you do not have enough dust, you can earn dust by playing ranked matches, playing in the Arena, or disenchanting cards. Be careful you don’t disenchant cards that are being used in your decks currently.  It is a good idea to save up your arcane dust to create Legendaries or epics. Don’t waste your dust on cards you will likely get simply from opening new packs.  The best way to ensure you get the legendary you want is to craft it. Every other method is luck based and you are not guaranteed to get the exact card you want. However, some Legendaries, like “The Elite Tauren Chieftain” and “Gelbin Mekkatorque” are not craftable and only able to be obtained during certain events or by opening packs.  It is probably a good idea to verify that the legendary you are wanting to craft is actually useful so that you don't waste your hard-earned arcane dust.  You will have the chance to get a legendary card in any pack you open. While using this method is the luck of the draw, you can buy packs directly from within the game or even on external sites. Good Luck!  ","play in the arena. craft a legendary. open new packs. "

Your Certificate of Formation should be signed by the registered agent.  An operating agreement is recommended, though not required, in Delaware. It does not need to be filed with the Certificate of Formation. Write an Operating Agreement that suits the unique needs of your business.The operating agreement exists to ensure that the state understands and respects your limited personal liability.  Your operating agreement should spell out what should happen to the businesses assets and liabilities in the case of business dissolution.

Once you have your filed Certificate of Formation, your operating agreement, and an registered agent, schedule an organizational meeting for all members of the LLC. The goals of this initial meeting will be to discuss and agree upon all items necessary to initiating the business. You'll want to have a secretary for the meeting who can keep accurate notes of all decisions for your company records.Record all members present for every meeting of your LLC.  Review, approve, ratify, and adopt the existing documents of your LLC at this meeting. This is the process you'll continue to use as your company grows, and future items are presented.  Discuss salaries, wages, bank accounts (existing or future) and all other matters necessary to start.  Have all members review and sign the meeting's minutes, affirming their agreement with what has been recorded.  If your LLC has more than one member, or if you plan to hire employees, you are required by law to file for a federal ID number (EIN). If you are opening a business bank account, you may also be required to have an EIN. Contact the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to request this number.There is no fee for an EIN.

"Not everyone learns by watching a teacher draw a diagram on the board. Try diagramming sentences with each student standing in place of a word.  Write each word of a sentence on a piece of paper or cardboard. Tape off a section of the floor for the subject and predicate. Have the other students instruct the word-holding students on which box they should stand in.  You can have students who represent words that belong together, such as prepositional phrases, link arms to show connections in a physical way.  Write a story, leaving out crucial words. Then have the students fill in the parts of speech at their desk without letting them see the whole story. The blank spaces in your story should have the name of a part of speech, such as a noun or verb, in the blank spot so that your students know what kind of word to use to fill in the gap.  Encourage a few students to read their stories, which will be silly since they didn’t get to see the original text at first. While this doesn’t teach diagramming, it does help kids learn parts of speech.  Alternatively, write equal numbers of verbs, nouns, and modifiers (such as prepositional phrases) on cards. Hand one out to each kid. Let kids wander around the room until they find two other people, so that each group has a noun, verb, and modifier. Then have the kids form their cards into sentences.  In another game, have the kids form groups. Give each group a bag of words written out on notecards. Have them sort the notecards into parts of speech within a certain time limit. The team that gets the most correct in that time period wins the game.  When teaching diagramming, try to make it lighthearted and fun to keep it more interesting. Also, don’t be afraid to change up your teaching technique to make it appeal to a wider variety of students. Everyone learns differently, so changing your approach will help more students grasp the material.  ","make the sentence diagramming process more interactive. try fun grammar games, such as classroom mad libs. use note cards. keep your teaching method fun and interesting. "
"Assemble a professional report that includes documentation and factual paperwork to back up your claim. Don’t hand the higher ups or human resources a fist full of scribbled cocktail napkins and sticky notes. Transfer all of your written notes into a typed and cohesive report.  If you have receipts, video, or photographic evidence, present them in a binder or folder. Making a professional presentation will send a message that this is serious and goes well beyond your boss having a bad day.  Meet with the human resources manager to present your report. When you make your appointment, let the manager know why you want to meet with her. Ask about confidentiality and whether you can submit your findings anonymously.Try to leave emotions at the door when you meet with human resources. Try to divorce yourself from the situation and approach it as if you are presenting the material on the behalf of someone else.Don’t name call. During the meeting, be as professional as possible. Never say that your manager is simply a “bad person” or “evil,” but instead lay out the facts and your report in a calm, confident manner.  Thank the human resources manager for her time. Be gracious with regard to the meeting. Be sure the human resource professional knows that you are thankful that your case is being heard.  If you work for a smaller firm that doesn’t have a HR department, you’ll need to talk to the next best thing. In many cases of a small, family run business, there are slim chance of your boss being fired. Most businesses consist of this type of structure: top-level managers, middle managers, first-level managers, and then the staff.  A likely hierarchy of a small company may be the owner, manager, department manager, supervisor, and then the staff.  Talk to someone in the chain of command who is higher than your boss. If your supervisor is repeatedly out of line, try talking to their manager.  When dealing with smaller firms, you must insist that your hearing be confidential.  If you're uncomfortable talking to your company about a boss, contact the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. This is a federal organization responsible for employment and anti-discrimination laws. This can include incidents of managerial abuse that violates anti-discrimination laws.

"Cut away dead and decaying foliage regularly.  Early summer: Dead-head flowers and remove any stringy bits at the end of flowering season. Dead-heading should be done weekly or fortnightly during summer unless you are looking for seed stock. Removing flowers promotes the growth of fresh leaves and often more flowers in many species of perennials. This should be done in early summer. Perennials suited for deadheading include alchemilla, Aquilegias, nepetas, geraniums, pulmonarias and Symphytums. (Winter: Tidy up and cut down the plants. Use garden shears (hand or electric) or secateurs. Make sure the seed heads are finished first and tidy the plants up so that they appear neat.;  , From time to time, it is important to keep an eye on how they are growing, then be sure that they are conforming to growth standards set for them. If they seem to be lagging behind for a long time, you may need to take remedial action to improve their lot, such as fertilizing or shifting their location in the garden.  If your perennials are up to being divided (and many of them are), this is an important means for thinning them out and moving extra growth around the garden. For most plants, this can be done wherever you feel it is appropriate, although some of the plants need this to be done regularly, as explained below. To divide perennials, simply:  Insert two gardening forks together into the centre of the plant, back to back and gently ease them apart.  Trim away any rotting, diseased or old growth from the inner part of the plant. Also remove woody parts. Select the best pieces of the plant for replanting (usually around the edges).  Replant the two halves - one back where it came from, and the other somewhere else in the garden.  Note that some perennials need regular dividing or they become scraggly and cease to thrive. Watch for heucheras, asters, monardas, sedums and stachys, which do need annual or biannual division. (, This will help ensure trouble-free existence for years to come. It also means ensuring that soil top-ups or fertilizing are very important to remember and do - add this task to your gardening calendar. If a previously moist but well-drained soil suddenly becomes soggy, you may need to either fix the soil, or shift the affected perennials, or you will notice that the plants no longer cope as well and may suffer from root rot or other waterlogging damage.  Keep the garden space well mulched and add compost to perennials every spring to give them nutrients to draw from. It is also important to feed perennials with nutrients throughout summer.  Use eco-friendly garden sprays (see 'Relateds' below for examples) on a regular basis to remove such insects as aphids, thrips, whitefly, beetles etc.  ","keep them groomed. check their growth. divide them. always use the right soil type for the perennial. add compost every spring. keep the insects at bay.

"For this trick you will need to cut one of your cards in half. Do this with a trick deck you don't plan to use for card games. Take out four cards: three jacks of any suit and a number card (4 of hearts or 7 of diamonds)., Use a pair of scissors to cut the numerical card in half so that the top and bottom of the card are still clear. Then use tape to join the ends of the severed card together. Don't tape in front of the inside of the card.  Your card should now be able to be folded without tape showing., Fold the numerical card on top of one of the jacks. Hold the cards so that the masked jack is in the middle of the other jacks. When showing the hand to people it should look like a numerical card in between jacks., Once you have the prepared cards in your hand, you're ready to try it on someone. First show your audience the 'three' cards. Make some type of line about how one card is being sandwiched between two jacks. You want to get them thinking about the two jacks in your hand., Now you're ready to finalize the trick. Turn the cards over so they are face down and pull them onto a surface starting with the bottom card. The masked jack will look like any old face down card. It is important to grip and conceal the sleeve card. Have someone from the audience flip the cards over.  When finished successfully, the audience will see three jacks.  Practice concealing the 'mask' and work on preforming this trick quickly. The faster you can do the trick, the more convincing your act is.  ","gather your hand. prepare the number card. mask one of the jacks. set up the trick. make the jack 'jump.' "
", Ensure that they are both the same width and the same length. The length will be determined by how large you would like the wreath to be., Wrap them around each other until you cannot wrap any further., You should now have a 2-braid circle wreath shape. Bake as normal for the clay., This is completely up to you and the end look you'd like and your skill level. It looks fine unglazed and unpainted, so the next step will presume that's as far as you're happy to take it., Find suitable ornamentation to add to the wreath, such as large felt flowers, felt or fabric ladybugs, felt or fabric butterflies, etc. Arrange these in a nice way at various intervals around the clay wreath. When you're happy with the pattern, glue in place.  Natural items are good too, such as wheat sheaths, gumnuts, seeds, etc.  You can add bows, glitter, charms, etc. as preferred.  Make sure that the knot is good and strong; there is a fair bit of weight to be hanging from this., Choose a wall or other similar placement for the wreath.  It is not recommended that a large wreath be hung from something that moves constantly, such as a door, as the banging movement of doors might break the clay.  ","use proper art clay for making this wreath. roll out two lengths of clay. braid the two pieces together. smooth the ends together to form a circle. decide whether to leave the wreath bare or painted/glazed. add decorative elements. tie a ribbon hanger onto the top portion of the wreath. hang the clay wreath in a safe position.

"A denominator is the number below the fraction bar.For example, if you are calculating 45+34{\displaystyle {\frac {4}{5}}+{\frac {3}{4}}}, you can note that the fractions have different denominators: 5 and 4.  A multiple is a number that another number equally divides into. You can also think of a multiple as the result of multiplying a number by a whole number. You are looking for the smallest multiple that the two denominators have in common.For example, the smallest denominator in 45+34{\displaystyle {\frac {4}{5}}+{\frac {3}{4}}} is 4. The first several multiples of 4 are 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20. The smallest of these multiples that 5 shares with 4 is 20. So, 20 is the least common multiple of the two denominators.  The result will give you a factor of change. This factor tells you how much bigger the common multiple is than the denominator.  For example, if the least common multiple is 20, and the first fraction’s denominator is 5, you would calculate 205=4{\displaystyle {\frac {20}{5}}=4}. That means 4 is the factor of change. The least common multiple is 4 times larger than the denominator.  Doing this will keep the numerator and denominator of the equivalent fraction in proportion.For example, if the factor of change is 4, and the first fraction’s numerator is 4, you would calculate 4×4=16{\displaystyle 4\times 4=16}.  The numerator will be the product of the factor of change and the original fraction’s numerator. The denominator will be the least common multiple.  For example, 45=1620{\displaystyle {\frac {4}{5}}={\frac {16}{20}}}.  The result will give you a factor of change for the second fraction. This factor tells you how much bigger the common multiple is than the denominator.  For example, if the least common multiple is 20, and the second fraction’s denominator is 4, you would calculate 204=5{\displaystyle {\frac {20}{4}}=5}. That means 5 is the factor of change for the second fraction.  This will give you the numerator of your equivalent fraction.  For example, if the factor of change is 5, and the second fraction’s numerator is 3, you would calculate 5×3=15{\displaystyle 5\times 3=15}.  The numerator will be the product of the factor of change and the original fraction’s numerator. The denominator will be the least common multiple.  For example, 34=1520{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{4}}={\frac {15}{20}}}.  Since the equivalent fractions have the same denominator, you can add the numerators as you normally would. For example, 16+15=31{\displaystyle 16+15=31}.  Make sure you use the common denominator of the equivalent fractions. For example, 1620+1520=3120{\displaystyle {\frac {16}{20}}+{\frac {15}{20}}={\frac {31}{20}}}.  ","verify the fractions have different denominators. list the first several multiples of the smaller denominator. divide the first fraction’s denominator into the least common multiple. multiply the numerator of the first fraction by the factor of change. write the first fraction’s equivalent fraction. divide the second fraction’s denominator into the least common multiple. multiply the numerator of the second fraction by the factor of change. write the second fraction’s equivalent fraction. add the numerators of the equivalent fractions. place the sum of the numerators over the new denominator.

"Don't tell even the most trustworthy of friends, for a mere slip of their tongue could give a clue of your password to hackers.;  , Let's assume you've been posting tons of stuff about your favorite thing on Facebook or Twitter. If your password is related, it makes it much easier for a hacker to guess your password. Therefore, as much as you want to, do not use a password related to something you like or what you post. Make it an extremely long, nonsensical, and unexpected garble of capital/lowercase letters, numbers, and preferably symbols. Of course, if you know you have a bad memory and won't remember the password, don't make it too arcane. You don't want to be locked out of your own Gmail account! There are many short but hard-to-crack passwords. Also, don't use your account password on any other accounts. Don't keep any password information for your other accounts on Gmail. Otherwise, the hacker(s) can crack into even more sensitive information, such as your bank account.  If a hacker is determined enough, they will eventually succeed. But Two-Step Verification makes it so much harder for them to crack into your account! Not only will they have to guess your password, they will need access to your phone. A text message or voice call with the verification code will be sent to your phone each time someone (or even you) tries to sign in to your account from a non-trusted computer. Unless you have hateful, hacking siblings and/or parents that share your computer, make your computer trusted! Otherwise, you will have to look at your phone and type in the verification code every single time. It is especially necessary if you have siblings skilled in hacking, which is a common case. Make every other computer untrustworthy! That means, even if it's your far off uncle's computer! And of course, a backup code will never hurt in case you do not have access to your main phone.  If hackers even with a verification code are doing suspicious things on your account, this will lock them out of your account.  Your IP address will be displayed on the bottom. And for the sign in details, it should have your IP address (unless you went elsewhere). Let's say you're in Nevada, and you use Google Chrome. If you checked the account activity and it showed an IP address from Rhode Island and the browser was Mozilla Firefox, your account was most likely compromised. Just because you set the alert preference to alert you for strange activity doesn't mean you're safe, of course. The most skilled hackers can make their activity seem completely innocent while ruining your account.  There is always a chance. If you have a recovery e-mail address, use it to send a message to Gmail about the compromising of your main account. If they take it seriously, your account should be safe in a little while. The other way to use your recovery e-mail if your password was changed is the e-mail it receives upon the Gmail account's password being changed. If you did not change it, it means someone else did. In that message is a link to change your password. Immediately change it. If the hacker(s) already sent messages to all your contacts (for example, to send them money), contact them as soon as possible and let them know any such messages are scams.  ","never tell anyone your password. don't pick a password that reflects your interests. enable two-step verification!, make sure in your gmail account, the 'alert preference' option reads 'show an alert for unusual activity'. regularly check your account activity!, don't lose hope!

"When you let an employee go, it’s important that you file this change with your state’s Division of Unemployment Insurance quickly and accurately.  This will minimize the risk of anything going wrong if the former employee files for unemployment benefits.  Any time you hire or rehire an employee, it’s important to complete all necessary paperwork in your state.  This will help minimize the chance of paying unemployment benefits to a person who’s actually ineligible to receive them.  If you appeal a determination to award unemployment benefits to a former employee, you must participate in the hearing.  If you file an appeal but fail to appear in court, benefits will be awarded to the employee.

"Choose a large roasting dish or other oven-safe container with high sides. This should be large enough to hold your smaller dish (or dishes) with about 1–2 inch (2.5–5 cm) of space around the edge, to allow for water circulation.Place this dish in the oven now, as it will be difficult to transport once filled with water.  Preheat your oven according to your recipe before you begin this process.  Ramekins and other small containers may slide against the surface of the baking dish when you pour in water. A folded towel or a silicone baking mat will help prevent this. This will also provide more insulation, but that is not typically necessary., Place the pan or ramekins that contain your dish into the large container. If you are using multiple containers, nestle them together in the center to prevent them sliding around.This method is great for custards, flans, cheesecakes and other baked desserts that contain eggs.  To prevent a skin forming on smooth custards, cover the small containers with foil., Heat water to boiling and pour it carefully into the larger pan, until it reaches ⅓ to ½ of the way up the sides of the smaller containers.Pour slowly to avoid splashing water into your food. If available, pour from a kettle or measuring cup spout.  Follow the baking instructions for your recipe, but check on the bain marie frequently. The water should be barely simmering. If it starts to boil, reduce the oven temperature.If the water level gets low during cooking, pour in hot tap water to replenish it.

"Empathy is one of the most powerful tools you can use to support parents of special needs children. The parents often have feelings of grief and loss of dreams and expectations, and they may feel guilty about these feelings.Stay away from saying 'I'm sorry' or making similar comments, but be sure to validate their feelings. It may be essentially automatic for you to apologize, but this isn't what the parents need to hear. You have nothing to apologize for, and you'll better support the parents by accentuating the positive rather than acting like something terrible has happened to them.  Ask if there is anything specific that offends or annoys them, so you can refrain from doing those things. For example, some people are deeply offended by 'people-first' language, in which you describe their child as a 'child with special needs' rather than a 'special needs child.' They prefer 'identity-first' language, instead.Although the word is used in legal and social contexts, many people also dislike the word 'disability,' because it focuses on what the child can't do rather than what they can. Others prefer it to terms they find patronizing or condescending. The only real way to know is to ask about their personal preference, if they have one.  Parents with special needs children want to protect their child, and may have significant concerns about the future. As someone who cares for them, your role is to acknowledge those concerns and recognize them as valid.Avoid using dismissive language. If the parents mention something about their child, you may be inclined to say something like 'oh, that's no big deal.' However, for that child it may be a very big deal.  Similarly, saying the child will grow out of it or be 'better' when they're older will only show that you don't understand that child's diagnosis or how it affects their life.  Instead, accept the parents' concerns at face value and acknowledge their validity. You might say 'I understand that you're concerned about Jamie making friends in a new school. That's a valid concern. What can I do to help?' You can also say, “What are you thinking about doing about it?” to help them develop solutions.  Parents with disabled children often feel powerless to help their children and may believe they are not providing enough for their children or doing all that they can do. You can support the parents by reminding them of the good things and maintaining a positive outlook on the future.They need people to remind them that they are good parents, so when you see them doing something admirable, say so.  Be there to celebrate with them on the good days, and on the bad days you can be the one to remind them of the good days and reassure them that there are many more good days ahead.  At times you may not feel like being positive, but being optimistic (even if you have to fake it) encourages the parents and families to carry on.  You do want to keep your optimism in check, though. Don't insist on a positive attitude at the expense of failing to acknowledge the parents' legitimate concerns. Saying things like 'Oh, it'll be just fine. There's nothing to worry about!' can make the parents think you're being dismissive.  If you also have experience with disability, the parents may come to you with questions. However, if you don't have experience raising a special needs child you typically aren't going to have any advice that would be helpful.If you've been reading about the child's diagnosis or about parenting disabled children, you may find an article or website that you want to share with the parents. However, you shouldn't do this in a way that comes across like you are judging them, or criticizing their parenting skills.  For example, if you read something that you think would benefit the parents, you might say 'I read this article yesterday that reminded me of you as a parent. Would you like me to send you the link?' If they are interested, you can share it with them.  ","empathize with the parents. acknowledge the parents' concerns. stay positive. avoid giving unsolicited advice. "

"You will need to figure out the rate and collect it on all sales in your state to submit in the future. Read your state's laws on collecting tax for online sales.  Buy receipt books from office supply stores that have carbon copies. Give the white copy to your customer and save all carbon copies for bookkeeping purchases.  If you make more than a couple of sales each year, you should have a program that organizes your costs, inventory, prices, sales and more for easy bookkeeping.  Buy bookkeeping software, such as Quickbooks to keep your information all in 1 place. You can also try the online bookkeeping sites, Stitch Labs or Outright, which is intended for craft sellers. You can keep track of your sales from all venues, inventory, expenses and business contacts for a monthly fee of $10 to $25 per month. The advantage of these products is that they keep a double-entry system, the standard for accurate accounting.  If you do not make enough in sales to warrant the expense of bookkeeping software, keep very detailed spreadsheets. Keep a sheet for every month of the year. List reoccurring expenses, variable expenses, each individual sale and tax collected. Calculate your income on an ongoing basis, instead of waiting until the end of the month. If you do not know how to work formulas in a spreadsheet program, sign up to take a class with a community college, lifelong learning center or public library.  Once you have a dedicated account, you are able to pay for expenses through the account and deposit your sales income. Your online statement will give you an opportunity to double check your accounting work to ensure your check book balances according to your spreadsheet or bookkeeping system.  Don't allow your bookkeeping to get too far behind, so enter sales as soon as possible. Save your receipts in a file folder in chronological order.  If you use an online bookkeeping system, you may want to invest in a free online receipt tracking site like shoeboxed.com. You can scan all your receipts from both expenses and sales and save them under headings. This will eliminate the risk of losing your receipts, if you have them in 2 places.  List the sales individually under the venue. Then, input the expenses associated with each individual fair, seller or online site to figure out the profitability of that venue.  Online and software bookkeeping programs should allow you to do this automatically by associating each sale and expense with a type of account. Use your spreadsheet or program to regularly assess your income and remove any channels that aren't profitable.  Do not wait until the end of the year to find mistakes that can cost you money or put you at risk for an audit by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).  If you have large revenue from craft sales, you may be required to submit quarterly or bi-annual returns as well as yearly returns. Although this may take more time, it can allow you to pay taxes slowly, instead of in 1 lump sum.  If you have a large amount of sales, receipts and expenses, then a tax professional is more likely to help you pay accurate taxes. By having a strong grasp of small businesses, an accountant may be able to save you money through tax credits and exemptions.  ","research your state's sales tax. produce a receipt for all your sales. invest in inventory and accounting technology. open up a business checking account and a business credit card. enter your receipts into your spreadsheet or software program after fairs or after a week of online sales. keep a separate spreadsheet for each venue that you sell. reconcile your bank account, online marketplace and spreadsheet/bookkeeping records every month. keep a regular schedule of submitting sales and income tax. consider hiring an accountant.

"A salon employee or online advice can help you find the characteristics of your hair. This will help you choose the right treatments and products. Here's the basic breakdown:  Wavy hair (type 2), generally thin and easy to handle  Curly hair (type 3)  Coily hair (type 4), usually very fragile and hard to grow out;  , Washing hair too often strips it of natural oils. Try washing it once a week. Switch to once every two or three weeks if your hair starts to break easily.  Try to find a shampoo that doesn't leave your hair feeling too dry.  To reduce damage, wash hair in lukewarm water and rinse in cool water.  The heat from blow drying can cause damage, leading your hair to break before it grows to the desired length. Instead, plait your hair, wrap it in a silk scarf, and let dry overnight. Alternatively, towel dry your hair by wrapping it in a towel and simply rubbing your head for a while.  Restore these with conditioner suited for African hair. Periodically deep condition your hair as well.  You can use leave-in conditioner in between washes.  Rub natural oil into the middle and ends of your hair to make it soft and supple. This will help prevent it breaking before it grows too long. Jamaican oil, castor oil, Moroccan oil, or lavender oil are all good options.  Covering your hair with a satin scarf can help your hair take in the oil.  Water strengthens dry hair and may stimulate your hair roots. You can apply water, moisturizing conditioner, or a mixture of half olive oil or half coconut oil. For extra moisture, apply each one, in that order. The oil will help seal in the moisture.  If you use gel or mousse in your hairstyle, try hair jam instead. This will hold your hair, then eventually melt into oils to add shine and moisture.  These can strengthen some types of hair, but may damage dry hair. Try brushing your hair: if your strands stretch significantly before breaking, you may need more protein.  Do not leave in protein conditioner longer than instructed on the label, or it may turn hard and brittle.  About every other day or when your scalp feels dry, apply coconut grease to the tip of your pointer finger. Apply at the top of your part and sweep back until all the grease has been applied.  Stop if you notice dandruff, as oil can feed the fungus that causes it.  If you have a perm, grease only once a week, or apply hot oil instead.  Once a month, use a neutralizing shampoo to clean all products out of your hair. If you use a lot of sprays, gels, and other styling products, use it every other week.  ","determine your hair type. wash your hair only when you must. let hair dry on its own. use conditioner each time you wash. shampoo strips your hair of natural oils. apply hair oil daily. moisturize. consider protein conditioner. grease your scalp when dry. remove products with neutralizing shampoo.

"Start with the music that rocked a generation. Hitchhike down to your local record store (or truck on over to eBay) and pick up the record of three days of love and music that defined the high point of hippiedom: Woodstock.  Listen to Jimi Hendrix and his inimitable rendition of Star Spangled Banner, Joe Cocker getting by with a little help from his friends, and the ever-popular Fish Cheer from Country Joe and the Fish.  For a truly authentic Woodstock experience, listen to it in the rain. In the mud. Naked, with friends.  While Woodstock has some of the best acts and most memorable songs of the sixties, don't neglect other music of the era as you build your hippie cred. (Actually, hippies never used the word 'cred.') Groove to some of these other great artist that tapped the toes of the Biggest Generation:  Bob Dylan. There's a dichotomy here, one you must resolve for yourself. Do you go with Acoustic Bob, or Electric Bob? Either way, Mr. Dylan is one of the key ingredients in any hippie repertoire.  The Beatles. Especially during their psychedelic period, when they'd moved from 'She Loves You (Yeah, Yeah, Yeah)' to 'Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds.'  Jefferson Airplane. Before the watered-down, glitzed-up popsters that were Jefferson Starship, Jefferson Airplane took us down a rabbit hole, and gave us somebody to love.  The Grateful Dead. If you don't know the Dead, then you just don't know the meaning of the word 'hippie.' These guys gave birth to an entire genre known as the 'jam band,' exemplified by bands like Phish, String Cheese Incident, and Widespread Panic (actually, The Allman Brothers Band gave birth to Panic). They also gave birth to an entire volume of jam band jokes, like 'Why do Deadheads wave their hands in front of their face when they dance? So the music doesn't get in their eyes!'  Janis Joplin. If there is an archetypal 'hippie chick,' it would have to be Janis. Of course, she had her hair, her beads, and her wild-abandon ways, and she also had a voice that could sear, soar, cajole, seduce, and stun with its power.  While there are far too many excellent hippie bands to list individually, you must become familiar with Crosby, Stills, and Nash (with and without Neil Young); Joni Mitchell; Judy Collins; Sly and the Family Stone; The Doors; Donovan; The Who; The Stones; The Byrds; Buffalo Springfield, and, arguably, Frank Zappa.;  , The music then was exactly what a generation needed. But time marches on, and there is awesome music being produced today that fits the ethos of peace, love, and understanding. Enjoy it. Being a hippie is all about openness and embracing what's good. As long as you can dance to it.  Understand fully the many aspects of the 1960s and 1970s that formed the hippie subculture. Learn how many of these people got together, what their general morals and beliefs were, and where they came from.  So much of the history of hippie subculture can be found on the internet today; possibly more than any other subculture. You can gain much insight into the Hippie subculture from watching the original Woodstock movie, 'Celebration at Big Sur', 'Monterey Pop', and so on. These are shown on Sundance and the Independent Film Channel, or you might be able to rent them from Netflix.  Don't just glue yourself to the History Channel (like wow, how to make a hippie feel old, man!). Read the words of the poets and authors and other cultural touchstones that defined hippiedom:  Electric Kool Aid Acid Test by Tom Wolfe about Ken Kesey and his Merry Pranksters is required reading, and when you're done, you will know if you're on the bus, or off the bus.  Learn to howl, and read the poetry of Allen Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac. While they themselves preceded the hippie culture, their works sparked the creative spirit in such icons as Hunter S. Thompson, and Bob Dylan (among many others).  Don't forget to laugh at the comics, and yourself. One of the greatest comedians to come from that era was the guy who gave us the 'hippie dippy weatherman with your hippie dippy weather, man.': George Carlin. Unlike many hippies of the era, Mr. Carlin stuck to his beliefs throughout his life.  Understand that being a hippie today is a bit different than being a hippie in the 60's and 70's. Hippies have new ideas on different topics that deal with the changing times. The hippie generation forming today is doing living by many of the same ideals that formed then, but the Vietnam war is over, and Martin Luther King, Jr., was more or less victorious in his struggle for civil rights.  Ask your parents what it was like while growing up in those days. You may be surprised—and, at turns, appalled—learning about your parent's bag was. They might surprise you, as they were once young and wild, too, and experienced many of the same things you are experiencing today, including love, war, a divided country, and a persistent existential threat.  Contribute as little to pollution as possible. Hippies love mother earth, and do all they can to keep it well. Buy clothing and products that are recyclable and are good for the environment.  Do volunteer work and learn about barter. Hippies in the 60s believed in trade or barter rather than money.  In the day, hippies had their own lexicon, as does every generation. Here are just some of the words that were part of the hippie's vocabulary:  1-A, closely related to Draft Card: This would determine whether you would have to go to Vietnam, unless you could get into the National Guard (hard), get CO status (harder), or move to Canada.  Babe, baby, chick, old lady: These were affectionate terms for women and wives or girlfriends.  Bag: Your thing. What you were or weren't into. 'Like wow, you know, needlepoint just isn't my bag.'  Blow your mind: Be really impressed by something almost unbelievable. 'Man, it blows my mind that your old lady used to be my wife!'  Bogart: Not sharing a joint.  Bummer: A very bad thing. 'Oh, bummer, man. I'm out of bread.'  Bread: Money  Cat: A hip hippie.  Cop out: Bagging responsibility and taking the easy way out. 'He loves the war, but joined the National Guard. What a cop out.'  Dig: To grok; to understand, or to like. 'I like really dig Sgt. Pepper, man, you dig?  Your thing. What you do. Your bag. You dig?  Far out: Like totally cool.  Gone: Really, really far out.  Flashback: An unexpected replay of a drug experience, without the drugs.  Freak flag: Long hair.  Fuzz: Police. Also, pigs, cops, and 'the man.'  Grok: To dig. Coined by Robert Heinlein in Strangers in a Strange Land.  Grooving: really enjoying something. 'Man, I'm grooving on these new tunes by Dylan'  Groovy: Very cool. It's a good thing.  Head: Somebody who enjoys drugs.  High: What a head usually is.  If it feels good, do it; Make love, not war; Give peace chance; : Hippie mantras  Joint: A marijuana cigarette.  Killer: Really good. 'That was some killer weed in that joint. Acapulco gold?'  Rap: To converse.  Split: To leave. 'Man, it's been great rapping with you, but I gotta split now, gotta get ready for my gig at the Fillmore.'  Wow: An expression that shows excitement. 'Wow, man, bummer you have to leave. Me and my old lady have some killer weed that will really blow your mind, you dig?'  , Or don't. Clothing is optional for hippies, and even when it's required, the key to being a hippie is to not care about the material stuff. It's about the attitude, not the fashion. So no need rummaging through eBay finding the right round-rimmed rose-colored glasses, bell bottoms, or tie-dyed shirts. It's just as credible to visit the bargain bins at Goodwill. As long as you're comfortable and colorful, you're cool.  Wear clothes made of natural materials, especially hemp. Hemp is the plant that releases the most pollution-preventing oxygen. Colorful ponchos and the Baja Jacket are a great hippie clothing staples, too.  Look into second-hand stores, thrift shops, garage sales, and making your own clothes and jewelry.  Hippies are known for their tie-dye attire, Native American jewelry, peasant skirts, and bell bottom pants. Men grew out their hair and facial hair, such as goatees and mustaches.  Women usually went places without a bra and no makeup. The image of the barefoot hippie is real, but they also wore sandals, soft boots or moccasins, even tennis shoes. Hippies were not immune to the weather.  Stand against anti-life things such as wars, and help to campaign for a more liberal society with issues such as gay rights and drug laws. Take a stand for the environment and give animals a voice.  Most hippies think that drug prohibition hurts more than drug use. Google LEAP (Law Enforcement Against Prohibition), or NORML (National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws).  Grow your hair and go to the hair salon as little as possible. Keep clean, but use natural soaps and deodorants and herbal products. Dr. Bronner's has long been a favorite maker of cleansing products for hippies. Make your own, if possible. Dreadlocks are a popular hippie hair-do too.  Some hippies are into smoking pot, and the use of psychedelic drugs such as mushrooms and LSD. More recently, ecstasy is also making a scene in hippie culture. Is it legal? Not at all. Is it dangerous? There's no consensus on that one. Ultimately, it's a choice for you to make, given what we know in the 21st century, but it was most definitely part of the hippie culture of the 60's. One can only wonder what would have become of bands like The Beatles or The Grateful Dead without their experimenting with hallucinogens.  Given that, you don't have to take drugs to be a hippie! Remember, many hippies—Frank Zappa, notably—avoided drugs and preferred the 'natural high', which they sought through meditation, listening to music, colored lights, dancing, backpacking, and other healthy activities. Also, recreational drug use (barring alcohol) is illegal in many countries, so do be careful.  Some hippies eat only organic vegetarian and vegan food, though keep in mind that in the 60s, 'organic' was not a food category, and veganism was rarely practiced. Most hippies were too poor to be too picky about what they ate.  Today's organic foods, free-range and health food stores are a legacy of the hippie movement; you might find hippies at your local one.  Stay away from foods with more than 10 ingredients on them. If they look confusing to your eyes, then they're NOT healthy!  , Support your local farms and buy produce from them!  , This includes taking cow's milk (a cow's milk is best for its young child), Bee's honey, (they create it themselves, therefore it's a by product of an animal), and eggs (in the case of chickens, they are basically a 'period' of a chicken; an unfertilized egg doesn't turn into anything, but fertilized by a rooster, it turns into a chick) out of your diet.  Study chakras and meditate.  These films capture the hippie counterculture pretty well.  ","feel groovy. play it forward. get counter-cultured. get up to date. try to follow hippie ideals. learn the lingo. get the clothes. do your part to make the world better. let your freak flag fly. like wow, man, look at the colors. become a vegetarian. go gmo free!, going to farmers markets is also a hippie thing. going vegan is also a good alternative if you believe that animal's lives should be well respected. spirituality is also pretty important for the neo-hippie. watch movies like woodstock (1970), festival express (2003), revolution (1968), magical mystery tour (1967), alice's restaurant (1969), and magic trip (2011).

"You may have a collection of shampoos that are meant to tame frizz, define curls, and smooth waves. What they probably all have in common is a few chemicals that actually make dry, rough hair worse: sulfates. Buy shampoo that is completely free of this chemical.  Commercial shampoos are made with sulfates because they act as an effective cleanser. They strip the hair of its natural oils to give it that 'squeaky clean' quality. The problem is they make hair too clean, and it damages the hair. In fact, the same chemicals are used in dishwashing and laundry detergents.  Health food stores and natural beauty product stores sell shampoos without sulfates. Look for a bottle labeled 'sulfate-free' to be extra sure it doesn't contain the chemical.  Some people with curly hair choose to forego using shampoo entirely. They find that their dry hair doesn't need to have its natural oils washed away, and water alone does the trick for washing out dirt.;  , Since sulfates wash the oils away from out hair, conditioners resupply moisture and shine by adding silicones to the mix. The problem is that silicones build up in the hair over time and cause it to start looking dry and dull. Buy a new conditioner that doesn't contain silicones; you may see results the first time you use it.  Hair balms, creams, gels, and other products also often contain silicones. Examine all of your products and toss or donate the ones that have ingredients that could be harmful to your hair.  Trimming away the split ends and other damaged sections of hair can go a long way toward making it look and feel healthy again. Get rid of the damage caused by your old shampoo and conditioner products. It's time to start fresh with a new routine.  Now that you aren't putting sulfates and silicones in your hair, you don't need to wash it every day. In fact, washing your hair that often can really dry it out, increasing volume and frizz. To keep your hair manageable and healthy, wash it two or three times a week.  Have you been washing your hair with hot water for years and years? High temperatures can really do a number on hair that's already rough and dry; the hot water causes the hair shaft to get frayed. Instead, go as cold as you can stand. When your hair is dry, it'll look sleek and shiny.  If you hate taking cold showers (who doesn't) try washing your hair separately, in the sink. That way you can use ice-cold water without getting chilled.  Here's the routine you want to avoid: roughly toweling your hair, violently brushing out tangles, then blasting it with the hair dryer. Hair that is already dry does not respond well to this rough treatment. Instead, use the following routine to dry your hair:  Pat it dry with a soft towel. Don't wring it out or twist it up in the towel; gently squeeze out the excess water, then pat it dry.  Apply leave-in conditioner or anti-frizz serum. Make sure it's free of silicones. Run some through your hair with your fingers while it's still damp, and use a wide-toothed comb to gently work out any tangles.  Let your hair finish air drying. Put away the hair dryer and let it dry the natural way. It'll take longer, but after a few weeks your hair will regain its natural health and shine.  Blow drying, flat ironing and curling your hair every day, or even a few times a week, makes for a lot of long-term damage. Try to adopt a styling routine that makes the most of your air-dried hair.  When you do want to dry your hair, choose a cooler setting on the hair dryer and use a diffuser.  If you want to curl your hair, try curling it without heat.  Getting your hair trimmed and shaped every few months will keep it looking fresh and healthy. Just make sure your stylist knows not to use shampoo and conditioner with sulfates or silicones, and ask her to use a cooler hair dryer setting and employ the diffuser when you're getting your hair styled.  If your hair is consistently dull and rough, you may not be getting the nutrients you need to keep it healthy.Incorporate more of the following foods into your diet:  Fish, avocados, and nuts that contain omega-3 fatty acids. These are essential to hair and nail health.  Fruits and vegetables with vitamin E and A, such as spinach, kale, carrots, and sweet potatoes.  Dehydration is another cause of dull, dry hair. Drink at least 8 glasses of water a day to restore your hair's shine and vibrancy.  ","use sulfate-free shampoo. buy silicone-free conditioner and styling products. get a trim. wash your hair less often. wash your hair with cold water. dry your hair with care. avoid using heat styling tools. get regular trims. eat nutrients that promote healthy hair. drink plenty of water.

"You need to find out if your situation is an isolated incident or if it's likely that many others have had a similar problem.  In many cases, the injuries suffered by each individual are so minor that they wouldn't be inclined to sue the company on their own.For example, you might have wrongfully been charged processing fees to purchase a concert ticket that only amounted to a few dollars out of your pocket. It would cost you more to sue the company for that money than you would stand to gain. However, if hundreds of thousands of people were similarly charged, the lawsuit could be worth millions of dollars.  Another common example of a class action lawsuit is a product that turns out to be defective, such as a bad seal on an auto part that causes the car to malfunction. In that case, many people may have relatively minor injuries, while others may have had car accidents that resulted in more serious injuries and property damage.  To get a class certified, you and your attorney must be able to prove that your injuries or losses are representative of similar injuries or losses suffered by a large number of people. The issues of both fact and law must be the same or similar for everyone in the potential class.For example, if you were injured as a result of an undisclosed side effect in a prescription drug you took, you could potentially have a class certified if others were similarly injured because of the same side effect., An attorney who specializes in and has experience with class action lawsuits will be vital to your effort.  Typically class action attorneys offer a free consultation to evaluate your case and determine whether a lawsuit is appropriate, and whether a class action in particular is feasible.  Class action attorneys typically don't expect payment up front. Rather, they take the case on contingency and are paid a percentage of the settlement, or of the award if you go to trial and win.  For this reason, you want to look for an attorney who has specific experience litigating class actions, not just individual personal injury or products liability suits. Class actions require an attorney to have significant resources available to research and litigate the case, and typically don't result in a quick recovery.  If you've found legal counsel, your next step is to get others on board with your suit so you have enough people for the court to certify the class.  Once the class is certified, you must make reasonable efforts to contact all potential members of the class, and this usually includes trying to notify people using a variety of general media including television, newspapers and magazines, or the internet.A good deal of marketing may be necessary to find affected members of the public who want to join the class. Some law firms run commercials on television, while others use online advertising and social media to get the word out.  Although you may receive a larger recovery if you act as lead plaintiff, you also must spend a lot of time and effort on the lawsuit.  To get your class certified, your injuries or losses must be typical of everyone else in the class, and you and your attorney must have a plan to litigate the issue and be able to represent the interests of the entire class.Keep in mind that you can't be a lead plaintiff if you have a conflict of interest with other class members.Lead plaintiffs have the best interests of the entire class at heart and want the larger wrong to be remedied – they aren't in it just for themselves.  As lead plaintiff, you will be consulted by the class action attorney and have decision-making authority regarding litigation strategy and whether to accept any settlement offered.In return for this work, however, you probably will be entitled to additional compensation than you would get if you were any other member of the class. Judges have broad discretion to award additional compensation to lead plaintiffs for the work they've put into the case.  Even after the class is certified, you must continue to provide information and help coordinate efforts to communicate with class members and negotiate a possible settlement.  Suing as a class means all of the people involved in the case can pool their resources.In addition to any documents or evidence you are able to provide, other class action members may come forward with their own information, which can strengthen your case.  Class action lawsuits often involve in-depth research that is far more extensive than that required in similar individual lawsuits. For this reason, your attorney may call on you frequently for updates or to get additional information about your injuries and experience.As lead plaintiff, your attorney also will consult you for approval on litigation strategies and whether to accept, reject, or make a counter-offer if the company you're suing issues a settlement offer.  ","research your case. talk to an attorney. connect with others who have been similarly harmed. understand the responsibilities of being a lead plaintiff. work with your attorney. "
"A baby significantly changes the lives of everyone around it from individuals to couples and families. Talking about and welcoming the inevitable changes about to happen can help you better prepare for your baby.Some things a baby may change are:  Personal relationships  Finances  Living situations  Lifestyle  , The concept of labor, delivery and a new baby may cause fear and anxiety because they involve things you can’t necessarily control. You may ask yourself questions like “Am I able to provide support during and after the birth?” or “What happens if I pass out?” You are not alone in having these feelings and it’s important that you recognize these are completely normal concerns.Avoid bottling up any fears and concerns you might have. Talk with the baby’s mother, family members, friends, and doctors any questions you have about preparing for your baby.  Remember that having a baby can really change your life and your relationship. Keeping in mind things such as the biological inclination for mothers to nurture a baby can help you prepare for the baby., Even if you are not together with the baby’s mother, a baby is likely to thrive when its parents have a positive and/ or healthy relationship. Maintaining a strong and healthy relationship throughout pregnancy can prepare and help you be as supportive as possible during birth and beyond.Discuss anything related to pregnancy, delivery, your baby and your relationship with the mom. You may not agree on everything, but finding compromises can help you better prepare for the birth of your baby.  Talk about your role during pregnancy and birth.

"Nothing quite beats the sound of an authentic piano, but many digital keyboards can replicate the sound of a piano, as well as mimic other instruments. They are also lighter and cheaper., Size matters when it comes to pianos. The bigger the piano the better it will sound. You hit a key on the piano. It triggers a mallet that strikes a chord in the piano. A bigger piano means that there is more room for the chord to vibrate. More vibration equals richer tone.  Consider the amount of space you have. There are two kinds of pianos — upright and grand. Uprights save more space than grand pianos. You might not have room for a grand concert piano at home. Uprights come in different sizes and can range from 35” all the way up to 52” tall. Grand pianos are not as tall as uprights, measuring around 36' to 48' tall and up to Fazaioli's 10' model.Consider how often you move, when determining the size of your piano. Remember that when you move, you’ll have to move the piano too. This can get expensive., Are you or your children classically trained? Or are you a novice? Some people buy beginner pianos and then upgrade later on. This is a safe bet, because many people lose interest in playing the piano over time.  If you decide to buy a beginner piano, purchase an upright piano. They are cheaper. They sound great. They save space. In general, they are ideal for people just starting out.  Do you want a wood grain finish or a painted exterior? Figure out which finish you like and how dark or light you want your piano to be. Most people only consider the piano, its size, and its sound quality. They often forget to think about how the piano will look with their other furniture.  Every piano company is different. Some feature more contemporary designs, while others retain classical flourishes. Look at examples of each piano design on the manufacturers' websites. This is a good way to get a feel for the prices of most pianos.  Upright pianos cost between $5,000 and $15,000 on average. Grand pianos normally cost anywhere from $10,000 to $50,000. Of course, these are average prices. You can find pianos at wildly different ends of the price spectrum. Pianos can be pricey to purchase and they also have additional maintenance fees like tuning costs. Expect to tune your piano at least once per year. This can cost between $100 and $350 depending on where you live.  Set aside an allowance of $250 to $1000 for initial repairs and transportation.  Consider the climate you live in, and set aside money for keeping your piano in good condition. Pianos are generally made of wood and wire, both of which expand and contract slightly with temperature changes. Climate can affect the frequency of tunings.  Unlike other big purchases , pianos depreciate in value very little over time if kept in good, working condition. Buying a piano might be a good investment.  ","make sure you want a piano and not a digital keyboard. figure out what size and sound you want in a piano. consider who will use the piano. choose the finish you want. research the different brands of pianos. determine a budget.

"Ask yourself, which of your friends is currently texting you? Which of your friends is currently calling you? Which of your friends is trying to keep steady conversation and progress a relationship with you? Who is learning about you?  If this sounds like the person you are asking about, it's because there is potential interest in you, and they want to keep exploring the possibility that you are the one.  If you see them infrequently and always with a group (and they don’t seem to be pushing for more frequent or individual contact), that’s a sign they like you as a friend.  They will probably give away the friend or lover vibe when there are other people around.If being rude is in your friend’s personality, they may not hide that because they feel comfortable that you accept them for who they are no matter what they act like. They don’t go overboard trying to impress you. A lover may suddenly become nicer when you're around.  Some girls bite or twirl their hair, blush, giggle, and usually just try to get your attention. Boys are not that different. Guys usually try to act cool and do stuff like laugh harder, try to be the center of attention, and kind of act like jocks – if they are trying to impress you.  He (or she) sees you several times a week, including weekends. You have met most or all his friends and coworkers. Everyone has heard about you. He makes plans for the future about you two, everything from buying a house, bed sheets, fried chicken, a ring, the brake job on the car. He talks as if you two will be together forever. He takes photos of you two and they are all around his house. He is very interested in what you do, think and where you go. He’s a lover.  How often do you think about this person? Can you ignore them or do you have to text back ASAP? Are they the first person you go to with big news (and are you)?  A lover is someone who puts you as their number one priority, and you are more likely to spend more time together and share the same lifestyle. Lovers spend most of their time with you. They are always making plans to see you.  Don’t fall for the trap of assuming sex means you’re in the lover role. Guys who don't love you and have sex with you, do not bond with you. Women have a tendency to bond more with guys when they have sex. However, sexuality is a component of most relationships that move from friend to lover.  Another piece of this puzzle is the lumping together of love and sex- historically, this was not always the case. If you had one-time, unplanned, casual sex with a friend, just be friends. If you date and have repeated good, exciting, and emotional sex with someone, they are a lover.  Sexual chemistry is a strong hint that he likes you for more. A friend is someone with whom we have fun and can share our deepest secrets with if we're really close with them; they are someone we go to the movies with or watch a sports game together. A lover is often just the same, only with an added sexual layer to the relationship, and an overall greater intensity. You think about them more, you feel excited and nervous in their presence etc., Jealousy can mean that a person cares in a way a friend doesn’t. Friends aren’t jealous if they are real friends because they want you to be happy. However, if you are jealous it could also be a sign that the love is unrequited or not returned.When your friend acts rude to a new friend whom you like, or always seems to put down the person you like, it's possible that they like you. They might be jealous and worried that person is going to take you away from them.  Do you get annoyed or feel irritated when he/she checks another person out or says anything good about their attractiveness in front of you? If you do, he or she is probably a lover.  Does this certain someone try to spend time with you alone? They may be a potential crush. But if they only speak to you with a bigger group of mutual friends, or are already taken, chances are, they're just a really good friend.  With a friend, they won't ever really act flustered around you. If you've ever been to a pool party and have that one friend who always sees you and gets flustered, that's one way to tell.  Consider whether he or she chases you. If you don't have to do anything to chase this person because they’re always around or trying to get you to hang out, they’re probably interested. If you have to make any effort, they are probably not that interested.  Consider whether your mood changes when you see this person. The feelings you get near a lover are not the same as a friend; they are closer and deeper. For example, you may feel happy around a certain friend, but with the person you love you feel as if your day has gone better by just having seen them.  When you are around them, do you get butterflies or do you just wave and chat? When you sit near or next to them at the lunch table do you think about holding hands or do you think about lunch? When you see them out of school do you blush and smile or do you calmly walk over to them and start a conversation? Do you find yourself dreaming about them when in or out of school? If so, you are in love with that person.  True love is all about a continuous sacrifice. It never ends. Your friends may not always be around, especially when your tough times start to become their tough times. But your lover will, and you may have to sacrifice a job, your health, money, time, and other things for them.  A lover knows you more than you know yourself. A lover would argue with you but wouldn’t stay mad at you because they just care too much. A lover would know your past...all the wrongs you’ve done but he/she would look past it, and they wouldn’t use it against you.  A lover would care for you when you’re down. That means that they bring you pizza and they would always imagine their future with you. If they want to travel to live in another country or find a new place to live in, they would always picture you with them. A lover would love you for who you are, even with your flaws.  This is the bottom line. Someone who considers you a lover will be more invested in you, more available to you, and they will make you a priority in their life.  How do they talk to you? Friends will start talking to someone else even though they were just talking to you and yell a 'hi' or 'hey' to someone they are friends with while talking to you. A lover is completely focused on you. Even if someone else says hi to them or tries to talk to them, they might not even notice unless you point it out or the other person does something like snap in their face to get their attention.  When your friend always seems to care more than they should, or they always tend to be worried if you’re okay, they most likely like you as more than a friend (or wish you liked them as more).  ","assess the amount of contact. study how they act around other people when they are with you. study the frequency of contact and whether you know his closest circle. see whether the relationship has a sexual component. determine whether they - or you - seem jealous. analyze the person's actions. consider how much you – or they - are willing to give up and how much you know each other. pay attention to whether you keep their focus.

"You have probably seen lots of films if you are interested in becoming a film director, but you can start to use your film viewing experiences as a way to learn about film making. Watch as many films as you can and pay attention to the details.  Try to count at least 15 mistakes in each film you watch. Look for acting errors, editing errors, storyline continuity errors, etc.  Develop your awareness of storytelling as you watch films. Try watching movies with the sound off and pay attention to how the story unfolds through images as well. Or, you can also listen to the dialogue, soundtrack, and other sounds in a film to see how the story unfolds through what characters say.;  , To become a director, it is important to get started right away and use any means necessary to make your own films. Get a camera if you don't already have one. Although a quality camera will help you to produce better quality films, start with any camera you can find.  Write your own screenplay or work with a friend who writes.  Get a group of friends together on the weekend and shoot scenes for a short film. Over time, you can edit the scenes together using a program like Adobe Premier.  Making short films will force you to start learning the technical aspects of directing. You'll need to know how to edit, write, and do everything else, too. Making your own short films will give you a chance to wear multiple hats and develop different skill sets.  The best way to learn to direct actors is by getting experience acting, whether this is by acting in your own films or being part of a drama group. Learning more about acting and doing some acting yourself will give you a greater appreciation for the actors that you are working with and it may make it easier to communicate with them.Try to learn the lingo of actors. For example, you can learn about different acting strategies or techniques, such as classical acting and method acting.  While you will probably start out writing your own scripts, you may need to work with other people’s scripts later on. Reading scripts that other people have written is a good way to practice bringing someone else’s story to life. When you read other people’s scripts, try to think about the details of how you would shoot each scene.For example, if two people are having an argument in a scene, how would you position them? What camera angles would you use? What kind of lighting would you use? What sounds would be in the background?  , Though it's totally not required, film school is great for three things: forced experience, access to crews, and networking. Plenty have made it who did not go to film school, but plenty more have made it who have. You'll have access to internships, workshops, and, most importantly, names, names, names. If you have a project, you can get a crew handed to you and you can network by helping others out, too.  Although highly competitive, NYU, USC, University of California at Los Angeles, AFI (Los Angeles), and California Institute of the Arts are some of the top schools. Several well-known directors have attended these schools, such as Spike Lee, Martin Scorsese, Oliver Stone, Ron Howard, George Lucas, John Singleton, Amy Heckerling, David Lynch, Terrence Malick, Francis Ford Coppola, and John Lasseter., Becoming a film director doesn't happen overnight. Most directors started out working as runners, camera operators, or performing other roles as part of a production crew. No job is too small. Whether it's filing paperwork, making sure the actors have their bagels, or watching over the camera equipment at night, it's a step in the right direction.  If you're in film school, look into internships. If you're not, check your local Craigslist, get in the know with the creative types in your area, and offer to be of service. If you're amicable and trustworthy, people will want to work with you again. And the gigs will get bigger and better each time.  A production company is more likely to give a chance to someone with five years of production assistant experience over some kid fresh out of film school. Try to find a production assistant job or another entry level production crew job and do your best.  Long story short, you won't become a director without a reel. That is the most important thing to have. That being said, this is definitely an industry where it's a lot easier to show said reel if you have an in. To get an in, you need to start networking right away. The more people you know, the more opportunities you will have.  Attend industry events, such as mixers, conventions, parties, premiers, etc. Introduce yourself to people and try to develop good relationships with the people you meet. Offer to help out on future projects or invite others to work with you.  On your path to become a film director, you will need to develop your resume with other types of directing jobs, like directing music videos, TV shows, and commercials. The paychecks you receive for these jobs won't be in the millions, but these jobs will help to fill out your resume with directing experience.  Some of these gigs will pay well and you may even enjoy the work, so don’t turn down a directing job just because it is for a commercial and not a feature length film.  Making short films with friends you have made in the industry is the quickest way to bulk up your reel. Work with the friends you've made, and with others who are also trying to break into the industry. Sometimes the budget will come out of your own pocket, sometimes it won't, but it's a necessary step on the ladder to success.  If you have a film you're particularly proud of, then you can enter it into a film festival. The great part about it is that you can enter a film festival anywhere. There are probably some film festivals in your state or region that you can participate in.  Sundance receives 12,000 submissions per year, so it is competitive. You may want to start smaller and work your way up.Just make sure you meet the deadline and formatting requirements!Quentin Tarantino's 'Reservoir Dogs' was discovered at Sundance Film Festival and Steven Spielberg stumbled upon a then unheard of film called 'Paranormal Activity' at a film festival.  Your reel, or portfolio, is what you'll be submitting to any project that's looking for a director, so it is important to make sure that it is impressive.Models submit their modeling portfolios, actors submit their headshots and resumes, and directors submit their reels. Your reel should include information about your education, professional experience, and films. Here's what you'll need:  Information on your educational experience  An accompanying resume showing your experience to date  Your contact information  Clips that also show your skills in editing, writing, animation and cinematography  A list of film festivals participated in and awards won  Miscellaneous experience -- music videos, commercials, animated shorts, TV shows, etc.  Stills and storyboards showing your process  , Even after you become a director, you're not necessarily on the top of the totem pole. You'll have to work with lots of different people and sometimes people will clash with each other or with you. As the director, keeping everyone happy will often be your responsibility.Start working on your people skills early on so that you will be well-equipped to handle different problems and personalities later on.  Keep in mind that you may have to deal with some really frustrating situations. Imagine that your producer calls you and tells you he doesn't like the scene you filmed at 5 AM in the middle of Nowhere, Kansas to get the exact perfect shot at the golden hour. The actress changed a few of her lines to give her character more depth and the money's gone. You'll spend the entire night reworking the script to make room for something that can be filmed tomorrow at the studio.  Once you have a decent reel, an agent may want to represent you. An agent can negotiate your contracts for you and help you to decide you what is and what is not in your best interest. However, you should never pay money up front to acquire an agent. An agent should only charge you if you make money as a result of his or her efforts.  A large part of an agent’s job will be to negotiate your 'gross points.' This is a fancy term for however much money the movie makes, you get X percent of it. When a movie makes $100, it's not that big of a deal. But imagine if your next movie rakes in $1 billion! Those gross points matter and they matter big time.  Get ready to take none of the credit and all of the blame. When a movie does well, it's rare that the director gets seen as the reason why. But when a movie does poorly, it's always that the director gets blamed. If it's a flop, you'll be hard-pressed to get another parallel gig anytime soon. Even if a movie that you direct is successful, you may not get as much recognition as the actors in your film.  Maybe not for you, but for the average Joe on the street, directors aren't seen as the amazing film visionaries they are. It's the actors that make the movie. So when it comes to the public, you'll go unappreciated. And when it comes to your crew, it's no different. If your movie is bad, your producers will blame you. If the actor is upset about how their hair looks, they'll blame you. It's a cycle you'll, best case scenario, grow to tolerate.  After you have had a few directing jobs, you can become a part of the Director's Guild of America (DAG) (provided you're US based, of course). By becoming a member of DAG, you're guaranteed a $160,000 salary for 10 weeks.  In most cases, you must be hired by a signatory company to be eligible. Or you make it big out of nowhere.The initial fee is a few thousand dollars and you pay minimal dues beyond that. It's completely worth it, especially if the projects are not constant.  After you achieve your goal, make sure that you enjoy and appreciate your job. It will be stressful sometimes, but it should also be quite satisfying. You will always be doing something different depending on the stage of the film that you are working on.  In pre-production, you're translating the script into a movie. Something visual. You're figuring out all the logistics, the casting, and the real nuts and bolts of it all. This is arguably the most important.In production, you'll be doing what everyone pictures directors do. You'll let the actors know what you see for them and how you want the scene to play out. However, you'll also be on a massive time crunch to paint a masterpiece. It will be chaotic, but also thrilling.  In post-production, you'll sit down with editing team and piece it all together. Make sure that you develop good relationships with your editors to ensure that you are on the same page. In post-production, you'll also figure out the music and all the other finer points to draw it all together.

"When you have small children, it is best to keep some household items out of reach. This does not mean you must eliminate them from your household. Instead, put them in high cabinets and consider getting child safety locks. You also can put special covers on doorknobs to prevent access to some closets or rooms. Items to remove from the reach of children include:Latex balloons  MagnetsFigurines  Decorations like tinsel or Christmas tree ornaments  Rings  Earrings  Buttons  Batteries  Toys with tiny parts (e.g. Barbie shoes, Lego helmets)  Little balls  Marbles  Screws  Safety pinsBroken crayonsStaples  Erasers  Small rocks;  , Toys with small pieces are not intended for young children and should include a warning label. Follow age guidelines on toy packaging. Do not give children toys from vending machines as these do not have to follow safety regulations.At restaurants with kids’ meals, ask for an age-appropriate toy.  If you spill a bag of pasta, for example, pick it up immediately. Check under tables and chairs for extra pieces. Anything on the floor is fair game for a child to place in his mouth., When your older children play with items like Legos or Barbie shoes, ask them to pick up their messes. Explain that they too need to be careful about small objects.Consider making it a game for school-age children to see who can find the most small items.  Although you cannot watch children 100% of the time, try to be as vigilant as possible. If you see them getting into something they should not, intervene immediately. Set ground rules for items that they can and cannot touch.  Remember that a child’s windpipe is as wide as a drinking straw. Remove seeds from foods like watermelon and pits from foods like peaches.This practice applies to both children and adults.  For hot dogs, slice the hot dog lengthwise. Then cut it into smaller pieces widthwise.Remove the skin.Quarter grapes.Be especially careful when eating fish with bones (which should only be done by older children and adults, not young children). Tell your children to try to take very small bites and remove any bones beforehand if possible. Do not swallow too fast.  Show your children how big a bite should be. Show that the piece of food should be smaller than their child-sized spoon or fork. Talk about how we need to eat slowly for safety and also to be polite. Instead of praising children for being done eating quickly, praise children who eat at a moderate pace.  When discussing healthy eating practices, explain to your children the importance of chewing their food well. They should chew their food until it is soft and easy to swallow. You might consider having them count to ten while they chew. After a while, they will be used to slower chewing.  Do not feed children solid, chewy food until they have sufficient teeth and are developmentally ready. Talk to your doctor to see where your child is in terms of development.  Children learn based on what they see. Try to plan enough time for meals so that you are not rushed.  Alternate drinking and eating. Teach your children not to drink and eat at the same time.Encourage your children not to speak and chew simultaneously.  Do not feed your young children while they are walking, standing, or otherwise moving. Sit at the table whenever possible with a straight back. In no case should your child eat and run. Also avoid eating in the car or while on the bus or subway.If you make a sudden stop, you or your child could choke.  Children under the age of five should avoid several food items. If you do give these items to children, you should cut or cook them very carefully (e.g. hot dogs). Although older children and adult can eat these items, they too should practice caution. Foods for young children to avoid include:  Hot dogs cut into coin shapes  Fish with bones  Cheese cubes  Ice cubes  Peanut butter in spoonfuls  Peanuts  Cherries  Hard candies  Fruits with skins (e.g. apples)  Celery  Popcorn  Raw peas  Cough drops  NutsCaramelsChewing gum  , Instead of serving raw vegetables, steam, boil, or fry them.

"Be sure to include as many people as possible. For example, for an office award, include department members and staff from other related departments. For a sports team, include the team members, parents, etc. For a school presentation, include classmates.;  , The speech should not just list accomplishments, but should tell the story of the achievement, no matter how big or small. Keep the story 'light' - the idea is to make the recipient feel special.  It is his or her special day, so the more you can do to make them feel special, the better.  , This not only adds a great touch, it provides an opportunity to share the accomplishment with others who may not have been able to join the award ceremony, through a newsletter, newspaper, or email. It also enables the recipient to have something tangible to relive the moment at a future date.  ","schedule a time in advance to present the award or trophy to the recipient(s). prepare a short speech explaining the recipients special achievement. invite the recipient to stand next to you when making the presentation. shake the recipients hand or give them a hug, if appropriate. , take a picture of the person receiving the award.

"Take a moment at the end of the day to ask your wife how she’s doing and how her day went. This could be during dinner or as you are both getting ready for bed. Ask her directly, “How did your day go?” or “Tell me about your day.” Then, listen patiently as she speaks to show her you are listening.You should also display open body language so your wife feels encouraged to talk to you about her day. Keep your arms relaxed and at your sides, with your body positioned towards her. Make eye contact with her as she speak so she knows you are paying attention to what she is saying.  This means paying attention to what your wife is saying and responding with an interested, engaged answer. Rather than brush off conversation with your wife or changing the subject when your wife comments on something, respond with an answer that keeps the conversation going. This will create a healthy dialogue between you and your wife and show her that you are interested in her concerns, even if they are not things you would usually discuss or talk about on your own.For example, maybe your wife enjoys gossiping about the latest drama with her work friends. She may say, “You will not believe what Donald did to Mark at the meeting today.” Rather than respond with, “Who cares? Can you pass the chips?”, you should make an effort to be engaged in what your wife is talking about and show her you care about her interests. You may say, “What did Donald do? He is always doing something inappropriate in meetings.” This will keep the conversation going and allow you to connect with your wife.  Sometimes, all it takes are three simple words to brighten your wife’s day: “I appreciate you.” Say this to her after she has had a long day, but comes home and prepares dinner anyway, or when she goes out of her way to help you out. Remind her that you appreciate her hard work and dedication to your family, even when she has had a hard or challenging day. Though you can always show her how much you appreciate her by doing kind gestures, saying the words directly to her can also make a big impact., Take the time to compliment your wife on a daily basis, even if it’s just a small comment, to let her know that you value her and appreciate her. You can use “I appreciate you” as a compliment or say, “You look great” as she heads out the door.Try to be genuine with your compliments, as you do not want to come off as fake or insincere. Make eye contact with her and smile as you give her a compliment, focusing on a specific thing she is doing or how she appears. Giving your wife one genuine compliment a day can show her that you continue to be amazed and in awe of her.  ","ask her about her day. be a good conversationalist. tell her that you appreciate her. compliment her, just because. "
"The fabric of your baby clothing might require special treatment for best washing, or may be washable with your normal laundry.Check the tag on each article of baby clothing and note washing temperatures, drying procedures, recommended detergents, and so on.  Pajamas and sleepwear are sometimes made of fire retardant material. This material usually requires special cleaning to preserve its flame retardant properties, so be extra careful to check tags on sleepwear.;  , Divide all articles of clothing into smaller loads of white, light, and dark colors.Keep any flame retardant garments separate to ensure you do not wash these with the regular laundry, as this can ruin the fire-resistant properties of those clothes.  If there are any differences in the temperatures at which you should wash the clothing, sort like temperature clothes into a separate pile.  You should always wash cloth diapers in a separate load, though you might consider washing these with towels to help balance the washing drum of your washer., Now that you've checked the tags on your baby clothing and know the recommended settings you should use, set both the temperature and washer cycle.Then turn your washer on and allow it to fill with water. If garments don't have labels, wash these in warm water except for:  Cloth diapers, which should be washed in hot water to improve sanitation.Flame retardant garments, which should be washed in cold or warm water to preserve their flame retardant features., Strongly scented detergent, too, should be avoided, as these can be overpowering to very young children. Measure the correct amount of detergent based on the size of the load according to tag and label directions.  Baby-friendly detergents are made by most major brands, and are usually clearly labeled as being recommended for babies' sensitive skin.  You can make your own baby-friendly detergent by combining 1 cup of castile soap flakes, 1/2 cup washing soda, and 1/2 cup borax.Add 1 cup of the mixture to your washer and you're ready to launder!  It is not recommended that you use homemade detergent on flame retardant garments. The oils used to formulate castile soap can break down the flame retardant fibers.  Scatter the load of clothes you are washing into your washer. Submerge each garment into the water and make sure weight of the clothing is distributed equally throughout the washer. Be careful to not overfill your washer., After you close the washer you will have to allow your baby clothes to run through the normal cycle. This will take some time, usually somewhere around 30 - 45 minutes. During this time, you might want to sort more laundry to prepare for the next load, read a book, or tackle some other chores around the house.  Any remaining soap in the fibers of your baby clothing can irritate your child's skin. To be extra sure this does not happen to your child, you should set your washer to run the clothes through a second rinse cycle.If you are using homemade detergent, castile soap tends to leave more residue behind than store-bought detergent. Add 1 tbsp. of white vinegar to the cycle to help with this.  If you are concerned your dryer might be too indelicate for your baby's clothing, you may want to consider allowing your clothes to hang dry on a clothesline.  ","read the instructions. sort your baby clothing. set your washing machine. add detergent to the water.babies have very sensitive skin, so be sure you use a detergent formulated for infants. make your own detergent. load your washing machine. await the end of the cycle. rinse your baby clothes again.

"Always shave after or during a shower or bath, regardless of the part of your body you’re shaving. Warm water weakens hair structure and raises it from the skin, making shaving less irritating. In addition, always apply a shaving cream or gel before shaving to lubricate your skin.Avoid shaving with just soap and water.  After applying shaving cream or gel, wait a minute or so before you start to shave. This will allow the cream or gel to reach the base of each hair shaft. That way, each individual hair will be slightly raised, your skin will be moisturized, and your razor will be less likely to cause irritation or ingrown hairs., Avoid shaving with dull blades. Change your razor every three to six uses, or more frequently if necessary. Check the razor's lubricating strip before you start shaving, and use a new one if it's worn or whenever a razor feels dull when you start to shave., No matter where you’re shaving, also go in the direction that your hair grows. Shaving against the grain pulls hair, causes irritation, and can cut the skin. Be gentle, proceed slowly, and avoid applying too much pressure on your razor.Rinse the razor with hot water after every couple strokes to prevent too much hair from collecting between the blades.  When you’ve finished shaving, you should wash your freshly shaved skin using a gentle cleanser. Rinse the area with cool water and dab dry with a towel after cleansing.Avoid skin cleansers that contain alcohol. If you want to go with a natural cleanser, consider applying witch hazel or tea tree oil to freshly shaved skin.  , Moisturizing after shaving helps your skin recover and helps prevents irritation. Rub a small amount of moisturizer over the area, and try not to over-moisturize. Leaving too much residue behind can block pores and weigh down individual hair shafts, which leads to ingrown hairs.  ","avoid shaving dry skin. allow shaving cream to set for a minute before shaving. use a sharp razor. shave gently in the direction of hair growth. wash your skin after shaving. finish with aftershave balm or moisturizer.

"Add a drop or two of liquid dish soap to a tub or bucket of water. Rinse and dry your fabric. While still slightly damp, press your fabric with an iron set to the 'silk' setting.  If you wish to sketch out a design instead of painting it freehand, this would be done after ironing.  Apply safety pins connected to rubber bands around the edges of your silk--every 4–6 inches (10.2–15.2 cm). Lay your silk over the frame and begin to apply push pins to the frame. The rubber bands will hook around push pins set into the frame to create a taut trampoline.  The rubber bands should be small enough to maintain good tension, but long enough to as to avoid tearing the fabric.  You can link two rubber bands together to create longer ones if your frame is much larger than the piece of silk.  The goal is to create a taut surface on which to paint. The surface should be taut, but should not be too tight that it begins to tear.  Place 4 plastic cups or containers under the frame to raise it off the work surface.  The resist can be applied with a paint brush, or through the narrow spout of an applicator bottle. Allow the resist to dry completely before moving on to color. Depending on preference, there are two type of resists that work well for silk painting:  Rubber based resists, or guttae, are similar in consistency to rubber cement and can be diluted to a thin consistency useful for drawing finer lines. After the color has been set, they are removed by dry-cleaning the finished fabric. The downside of this resist is the fumes it produces. It is recommended that you use a respirator in a well-ventilated area when applying rubber based gutta.  Water soluble resists are non-toxic, odorless, and wash away in warm water. These resists work well in conjunction with silk paints (as opposed to dyes), which are heat set with heat. The downside to this resist is that it's not as free-flowing as other guttae, and fine details are harder to achieve.  Carefully apply your dye or paint with a brush. Allow the color to flow towards an area of resist. Painting directly on the resist may cause it to dissolve and fill in. There are two options when it comes to color:  Silk paints are pigment-based products that color the surface of the fabric, but do not penetrate into the fabric's fiber. These colors can be used on a wide variety of fabrics (including synthetics) and are set with a dry iron  Silk dyes color fabric by forming a bond with the fibers in the fabric. These are a wonderful choice if you do not want to diminish the natural luster of silk. Colors are light-fast and washable.  If you have opted for silk paints, heat-set the color by applying the iron for 2-3 minutes on the back side of the fabric. After ironing, rinse the silk in warm water, hang to dry, and iron again while still slightly damp.  If you used silk dyes, after allowing the color to dry for 24 hours, rinse the fabric until the water runs clear. Add a couple of drops of light detergent or dish soap to a bucket or tub and wash the silk. Rinse again with cool water, and hang to dry. When the silk is almost dry, apply a dry iron heated to the 'silk' setting.

"Find a place to be alone. Sing through the song and don’t bottle up your feelings. Suppressing the urge to cry will just prolong your pain. Take the time to sing to yourself, being fully present in how you feel. Let the tears flow freely, and spend as much time doing this as you need. You may need a whole day, or even several days to get it all out. Treat the process with the same sincerity as you would a true grieving process. You deserve it! If you don’t invest time in releasing your intense feelings, they will continue bothering you when you perform.;  , Take a break from singing and just listen to the song. If you can access other recordings, listen to as many versions of the song as possible. If no recordings are available, record yourself singing it once and just listen to that recording. Embrace the emotions that come over you as you listen. As intense or time-consuming as this process may be, your reward will be a deep insight into your emotional self. This will not just help the tears subside; you will likely start to heal from serious pain you still carry from past experiences. This will aid you on your quest to greater resilience.  Make sure you write about this valuable experience. Verbalize what you are feeling. Write down your thoughts and read them aloud to yourself. Feel free to share these thoughts with a trusted friend. Articulate what you’re feeling in the mirror. There is no such thing as coming to understand your feelings 'too much', especially as a performer. Even if you think you are 'over it' at this point, writing about your experience will help you preserve valuable insight for the future.  Sing the song and allow your emotions to manifest themselves as they will. If you are still crying at this point, don't fret. The sting will lessen with time. In the meantime, you will learn how to sing through your crying. This skill will rescue you in emergencies when you get emotional during performance.  If after cycling through these steps you still don’t feel better, do something else. Take out the trash. Go for a walk. Work out at the gym. Talk to a good friend. Volunteer at a soup kitchen. Take a bubble bath. Do anything to get your mind off the song. A lively activity followed by relaxation could do wonders for you.  When you're ready to sing the song again, take some time to imagine yourself doing so successfully. Close your eyes and imagine yourself performing the song. Visualize yourself doing so successfully. What do you sound like? What do you look like? What do you see around you? Take note of as many other details as you can. Act like a little kid and draw what you see. Let your right brain indulge in this sensory experience.  By now you have let yourself cry it out, think deeply, take a break, and reflect about your experience. At this point, you have hopefully taken the edge off the pain you used to feel when singing this sad song. Go ahead. Sing it again and see what happens.  If your attempt to sing still makes you bawl, don’t give up. Repeat these steps in whatever order helps you the most. If your efforts seem futile, don’t be shy about seeking professional help. There may be unresolved issues that need addressing—not just so you can get through the song, but so you can live a happier life.  ","cry it out. let it wash over you. write it out. sing it over and over. do something else. meditate and draw. try again. rinse and repeat. "

"It’s easier to pretend that problems do not exist. However, don’t keep putting the issue on “pause” indefinitely.This can lead to feelings of resentment building up. If this is an issue that bothers you, then it’s important enough to deal with it together.  If the issue of commitment seems to come up then go away frequently, set aside time to definitely talk about it and reach a conclusion together.;  , Take a step back and ask yourself, “What is it that I want?”Think about what motivates you to be in this relationship and why you’ve chosen this person. What brings you happiness? What things make you think twice about this person?  Some people enjoy the feelings of being in a back-and-forth relationship. Ask yourself if you enjoy the uncertainty or the tension this creates.  Having an idea of what you want to say can help you stay focused and not let emotions take over during the discussion. Think about the main thing you want to discuss, and aim to keep this the focus of the conversation.Resolve not to let the conversation get off track or distracted.  Your key point may be, “I want this to be a committed, monogamous relationship.”  One way to prepare is by starting at the end of the discussion. How would you like this discussion to end? Start there and find ways to prepare what to say to get to that point.  Prior to having the discussion, plan what outcome you would like to see occur as a result of the conversation. Are you wanting your significant other to give you a verbal commitment? Or are you planning to give an ultimatum of “commit or the relationship is over.” Think through how you want to approach the discussion and what goals you have in mind. Be willing to commit to your plan.  Prior to going into the discussion, think about your timeframe. Are you unwilling to continue in the relationship unless your significant other proposes within a certain time limit, like one year? Will you cut off the relationship right away if your significant other refuses to call you girlfriend/boyfriend?  , Don’t assume you know how the conversation will end. Instead, approach the situation with curiosity and be willing to accept that anything can happen.Don’t assume you know how your significant other will react or what he or she may say. You may be surprised at what your significant other says or learn something new about him or her.  It can be difficult to start an emotional conversation. When starting a conversation, share what you want for your significant other.Share what’s important to you and how it relates to your significant other.  You can start by saying, “I enjoy our relationship and I hope you do, too. I hope you feel as happy being with me as I feel with you. One thing that causes me to feel unhappy is our differences on commitment. Can we talk about that?”  For more information, check out How to Handle Difficult Conversations.  Be honest and encourage your partner to be honest as well, as it’s in both your best interests to communicate your thoughts and feelings.Communicate what you want from your significant other and from the relationship. Say, “I want to be in a relationship with you. I want this relationship to be exclusive.”  , Ask your significant other about what matters to you. Listen closely to hear if there are any unmet expectations from your significant other. Does your significant other fear rejection or disappointment? If anything is unclear, ask a question.Some questions you can ask include, “What are you getting from this relationship? What makes you want to stay in this relationship? Are there things that make you unhappy? What fears do you have about being in a relationship?”  , Listen closely to what your significant other says. Don’t think up things to say while your significant other talks. Instead, do your best to appreciate your significant other’s perspective and understand it more fully.If you don’t fully understand your significant other’s perspective, ask about it. Say, “What experiences have made you feel fearful?”  For more information, check out How to Listen.  Choose your words carefully, as your significant other may feel like he or she is being blamed. Avoid saying things like, “you never….” or, “you always….” Don’t put all the responsibility onto your significant other. Take responsibility for your own thoughts and feelings, and recognize that blaming won’t help you move forward in this relationship.Take ownership of your feelings. Use “I” statements instead of “you” statements, which can help remove blame. For example, instead of saying, “Why won’t you commit to me?” say, “I feel hurt by the fact that I want a committed relationship and it seems less important to you.”  , Be willing to end the conversation with each of you willing to compromise. This may be more difficult if one person wants to break up and the other person does not, however, you may make your goals to treat each other with respect, or to prioritize any children involved.One goal you can have is to stay monogamous or to give the relationship one full month of commitment.  Your significant other may have abandonment issues or other challenges that interfere with the inability to commit to you and the relationship. He or she may be dealing with some problems from past relationships (like cheating) or from childhood that impede the ability to commit now.Individual or couple’s therapy may be beneficial for working through these problems with a therapist.  If you have a discussion and it doesn’t end with a solid conclusion, you may feel more confused than ever. You may decide to put your life on hold while your significant other decides whether he or she wants to be with you, yet think about how this is helping or hurting you.Don’t allow your wants, desires, and needs to be pushed aside while your significant other figures out what he or she wants.  Ask yourself, “Will I regret these actions if the relationship doesn’t work out?”  Ask, “Am I letting this person dictate my life or giving control over to this person?”  , You may choose to stay with this person despite the differences of opinion on commitment. If this is the case, you may need to give up any feelings of negativity, hurt, blame, or judgment. Radical acceptance means choosing to accept life as it is without forcing your own desires or wants on top of what is. It means accepting things that may feel unfair or hard without resisting what you cannot or choose to not change.If you stay in a relationship that does not meet your needs 100%, then it is up to you to accept the situation. If your significant other has made it clear to you that he or she does not plan on changing, then it’s up to you how to respond. If you stay, you cannot express resentment or negativity for this choice. Instead, recognize you have made a choice and will handle the consequences.  Say to yourself, “This is the choice I have made and I accept the feelings and consequences that result from it.”  , Don’t allow yourself to get completely wrapped up in fears about the relationship. Put your energy into pursuing things that encourage you to grow and become a better person. Follow up on your own hopes and dreams and remind yourself that you can accomplish your goals outside of your relationship.Start a meditation practice, yoga, or relaxation. Join a gym or start an activity you enjoy, such as sewing or painting.  If you made goals or agreements during your discussion, follow through on them. Ask your significant other to also follow through on any agreements he or she made. While having the discussion was important, it’s equally important to follow through on anything discussed.  For example, you may have agreed to a monogamous relationship for 1 month, or you agreed to stay together as long as you move in together in 2 months. If your significant other agreed to propose to you within 3 months, make sure these agreements are kept.  If your significant other refuses or is unwilling to follow through on agreed upon items, this is a red flag.  If you feel like you are not getting your needs met, it’s not worth staying in the relationship. You might feel like you put in more work and effort than your significant other yet feel unfulfilled. If there isn’t a balanced give-and-take in the relationship, think about leaving. You may feel like this issue is a “deal breaker”, and if so, break the deal.  ","recognize that avoidance won’t solve commitment problems. be honest with yourself. prepare what you want to say. decide what outcome you want from talking to your partner. let go of knowing the outcome. open the conversation. talk about what each of you wants. ask questions. listen intently. avoid blaming. agree on common goals. attend therapy. avoid waiting around. practice radical acceptance. pursue your own interests. follow through on any agreements. break it off.

"If you want to operate a giving fund on a somewhat larger scale, you should talk to people you know. Find a group of like-minded people at work or other friends and discuss the idea of creating a group giving fund. With more people involved, you will be able to generate more money and do more good for others.When a small group of people become involved, the title may change to a “giving circle” or a “giving club.” But the principles remain the same.  As a group, you should decide on some basic issues. While no written by-laws of any type are required, it may be a good idea to write down some key operating details, especially if you want your group to exist over time. Some things to decide early on are:Will you hold regular meetings? If so, when, where and how often?  Will regular contributions be required? How much from each member of the group?  What is your group’s mission or outreach? Will you have a particular focus?  How will your group decide who to give money to?  , If you create a personal giving fund for yourself, you can mange just setting the money aside in any safe place. However, when you involve a group of people with more money, you should create a separate bank account. You may want to talk with an attorney or tax adviser for advice about naming the account and about any tax issues that may be related to it., This goes along with discussing your group’s mission and outreach. You should determine what types of needs you will seek to address. This will help you make decisions about donations in the future, and it may also help bring some attention to your group and generate additional giving.Some ideas might be to focus on local schools, non-profit arts organizations, assisting underfunded animal shelters, or anything else that interests your group members.  As a group, you should decide in advance how you will plan to make donations out of your fund. Determine if you will want to have groups apply to you or if you will want to make the donations unilaterally based on members’ suggestions. What criteria will you consider in choosing any one group over another? How formal a process do you want to create? These are all considerations that you should review before beginning your work together., You should not rely solely on memory for future donations. As you make grants to various individuals or organizations, you should keep records of dates and amounts. These records will help you in the future, if the names come up again. You can decide whether you wish to donate to the same organization multiple times, and in what amounts., Especially in the early stages, you should develop a process of reviewing your group’s operations. Decide if the group is functioning as all the members had wished. If you are not meeting the goals you had set for yourselves, then you should examine why. Make any changes in your operating structure that you feel are necessary to help meet those goals.  ","encourage a group of friends or coworkers to participate. set up your goals and structure. open an account. establish a focus area for your group. develop criteria for giving. keep records of your group’s donations. review your groups activity regularly.

"Make sure the vegetables you use are ripe and undamaged with no spots or bruises. You will need:  5 pounds tomatoes  1 pound canned green chilis, chopped  2 jalapeños, seeded and chopped (if you want extra spicy salsa, add two more jalapeños)  2 cups chopped white onion  3 cloves garlic, minced  1 cup white vinegar  1/2 cup chopped cilantro  2 teaspoons salt  1 teaspoon sugar;  , Canned tomato salsa tastes best when the tomatoes have been peeled. To peel the tomatoes, use the following method:  Remove the stems from the tomatoes and give them a rinse.  Use a sharp knife to cut an 'x' at either end of each tomato.  Put a large pot of water on the stove and bring it to a boil.  Blanch the tomatoes by dropping them in the boiling water and allowing them to cook for 30 seconds.  Remove the tomatoes, allow them to cool, and peel off the skin at the 'x.' It should come right off.  Taking care to preserve the juices, use a knife to slice out the core of the tomatoes.  Chop the tomatoes and set them aside in a bowl with their juices.  Bring them to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium low and allow the salsa to simmer. Taste to make sure the salsa has enough spices, and add more if necessary.  Use a thermometer to make sure it reaches a temperature of 180 degrees Fahrenheit (82 degrees Celsius). This kills any enzymes or bacteria that may otherwise spoil your canned salsa.  Fill the jars to within a quarter inch (half a cm) of the rim. Use a funnel to ensure that the seal between the jar and the lid stays clean.  You may want to wash the canning jars using the hot water cycle on your dishwasher before starting the process. Place the lids into boiling water for a couple of minutes to sanitize them.  If you spill salsa on the rim of the jars, wipe it off with a paper towel before proceeding.  Screw on the lid rings to make sure they stay put. Don't tighten the lids too much at this point, since air needs to escape at the next stage of the canning process.  Fill the pot with water until it covers the jar by 2 inches (5 cm). Turn the burner to high heat and bring the water to a boil.  If you live at low elevation, boil the jars for 15 minutes.  If you live at high elevation, boil the jars for 25 minutes.  Allow them to cool completely. The lids will make popping noises as they cool and seal.  If a lid makes a popping noise when pressed down and released, the can has not been properly sealed. You can place unsealed jars in the refrigerator to use immediately, or put them through the canning process again.  ","gather the ingredients. prepare the tomatoes. place all of the ingredients in a large steel pot. cook the salsa. pour the salsa into clean canning jars. place the lids on the jars of salsa. place the jars in a large pot. remove the jars from the water carefully. check the seals by tapping on the lids. finished.

"Look for products with the following in the first seven items on their list of ingredients:  Benzoyl peroxide: kills the bacteria that cause acne, helps remove oil from the skin and removes dead skin cells that can clog pores.  Salicylic acid: helps prevent pores from becoming plugged.  Alpha hydroxy acids: help to remove dead skin cells and reduce inflammation, and stimulate the growth of newer smoother skin.

"A smart way to develop an easy-to-remember password is to combine three small words of significance to you, and make a single password. For example, you can use 'mydogspot' or 'jimswifejane.'  Remember, sheer length is far superior to a shorter but random mix of numbers, letters, and symbols, which will be difficult to remember.;  , Develop a password using the first letters of a sentence or phrase that means something to you - like your national anthem or a slogan you have seen somewhere. 'Don't shop for it, Argos it' would become 'DsfiAi.'  , Choose one letter of the first word and one letter of the second word, and repeating this until you get to the last letter of each word. An example could be:  Say your most important possessions are house & plane  Password: hpoluasnee  , Length can be a huge advantage to memorization. If your typing is fairly accurate, consider large phrases from a book, speech or movie, such as:  'It was a dark and stormy night!'  'My fellow Americans!'  'Houston, we have a problem.'  The length can provide security even if special symbols are not used. This can help with sites that prevent the use of symbols.  Make good use of punctuation and capitalization to make a secure pass phrase that complies with common password rules.  ","make a compound word. connect the first letters of a sentence. choose two words and combine their letters. come up with a pass phrase. "

Whatever the case may be, the first step is recognizing and stating there is a problem. Be clear and specific when talking about what went wrong. This lets the recipient (your boss, customers, coworker) know that you see the problem, and understand it., It seems simple enough, but your apology will go a long way if you actually say that you are sorry for what happened.Use “I” statements to get the apology across. “I’m sorry,” or “I deeply regret what I did.” This puts the focus on you, and what you did. Otherwise, it might sound as if you are blaming the other person.  Make sure to avoid the non-apology, or apologizing for how someone else feels. Avoid statements like “I’m sorry if what I did upset you” or “I’m sorry you took that the wrong way.” When you do that, you aren’t actually apologizing for your actions, just the result, which suggests you didn’t so anything wrong., Try to help the recipient understand how the mistake happened. Even if it was just an oversight or error on your part, identifying the cause of your mistake is a way to tell the other person that you know what happened and can avoid doing it again in the future.  One important part of this is to make sure the apology and explanation are separate from one another. While you want to make sure the recipient understands your intentions, the important thing is that you apologize first. Once that has been accepted, then you can move on to explaining yourself., If you are apologizing, then something has gone wrong. While your apology is a nice start, in order to maintain a good professional relationship it is important that you work with the recipient on finding a solution to the issue. The way you go about doing this depends on the nature of your mistake.  If you are a company apologizing to your customers, explain how you intend to resolve the problem. Make sure you include specifics related to the original problem. Avoid generic statements like “we are doing everything possible to prevent problems like this in the future” will come off as insincere without details.When dealing with customers, resolving the problem can mean giving the customer a discount on their next order if the mistake was a pricing error, or shipping the next order for free if it was a shipping or delivery mistake, or paying for damages that occurred as a result of mishandling. It is important to provide options like this as a way to keep customers.  If you are apologizing person-to-person, such as to a co-worker, you may consider asking for discussion and input on the way to resolve the issue. The recipient may not want to discuss it further, but you should give them the option. Offer by saying, “I am open to discussing what happened so we can work on avoiding this again in the future,” or something similar., Depending on the setting, an apology may be seen as an admission of guilt, especially if you are apologizing on behalf of your company to customers. If you or your company is not at fault for what happened, you do not need to issue an apology.Don’t take responsibility for things that are not your fault, and you will avoid over-apologizing, which can weaken your image with co-workers or customers. It is certainly appropriate to express empathy, but you should avoid taking responsibility. You can tell people “I’m disappointed to hear that,” and offer to help resolve the problem, but avoid saying “I’m sorry.”  If you are apologizing on behalf of a business to your customers, this may be seen as an admission of responsibility, and you may be held legally and financially liable. Make sure you discuss what happened with a lawyer to discuss any potential legal difficulties before apologizing. This isn’t effective for lots of the smaller mistakes that may happen with customers daily, so you may consider creating company policies for certain mistakes, and how your employees should handle them.  If your customers are angry or upset with something your business has done, you need to move quickly. They are more likely to listen to an explanation if you issue it as soon as possible. The longer you delay saying anything, the more angry the future recipient will be.While there are times when you should delay apologizing in order to consult with other people, such as a lawyer, it is important that you get on that as quickly as possible so you can get your message out as soon as you can.  Depending on the nature of your error, including what you did and who it was against, there are different mediums you can use to respond. If your mistake was one that affected all of your clients, an email is a good choice. If your error was posting an offensive or inappropriate message through social media, using that platform as a place to express your contrition.  If you need to apologize to someone in your own company, or to a specific client, try to arrange for a face-to-face meeting. If you can’t be in the same place, try video-conferencing, then a phone call. The closer you are able to get to the person you are apologizing to, the better. This will make you look more serious when offering your apology., Once you have apologized, and the apology has been accepted, you both need to be prepared to move past it. Hanging on to the issue will only make the situation more difficult to handle.This goes for recipients too. If someone apologizes to you, and you accept it, there is no need to dwell on the mistake any longer. Bringing it up again will look petty or unprofessional.  ","acknowledge the problem. make sure you say “i’m sorry.” acknowledging that you were responsible is the most important part of the apology. offer an explanation. offer to fix the problem. make sure it is appropriate. act quickly. find the appropriate medium for your apology. move on after apologizing.

"A number of purple shampoos--literally, the shampoo is purple--are available at salons and drugstores, and they work to counteract brassiness in blonde hair.”Brassiness” is when blonde hair takes on an unflattering yellow or orange tone. It results when the blue molecules in hair begin to fade and leave the yellow and orange molecules to shine through more strongly.  Purple shampoos work by restoring blue tones to the hair, helping to prevent brassiness.;  , The minerals in tap water can contribute to changing blonde’s natural tone into a brassier color (from iron deposits) or into a greenish color (from the chlorine in the water).Installing a filter on your shower head will help prevent those color-changing minerals from being absorbed into your hair and will help keep your hair its natural shade.  If your hair is taking on a brassy tone, make an appointment at the hair salon to have toner applied or buy toner at a drugstore and apply it yourself.Toner increases the blue and purple tones in your hair and mutes the orange and yellow ones, counteracting brassiness.  You can typically expect to pay about $40 or more for a toning treatment at a salon.  A drugstore toner will typically cost around $10, but may not be as effective as a salon treatment.  Spraying your hair down with tap or filtered water before going in the pool will help prevent it from soaking up chlorine in the pool water.Be sure the water you’re spraying your hair with isn’t already highly chlorinated, or it will defeat the purpose.  If your hair begins to take on a greenish cast after swimming in a pool or because your shower water contains higher levels of copper or chlorine, you can help tone down the green by using an acidic hair rinse. An acidic hair rinse will remove the buildup left behind by styling products and mineral deposits that can cause changes in your hair color.Mix 1/2 cup (for shorter hair) to 1 cup (for longer hair) of apple cider vinegar with 16 ounces of water. After shampooing, rinse your hair with the vinegar mixture and let it sit for about 5 minutes. Rinse your hair again and style as usual.  Dissolve 6-8 aspirin tablets in a glass of warm water and rinse your hair with the solution. Let it sit for 10-15 minutes, then rinse out the solution.

"On Windows Vista or Windows 7, open the command prompt as default user, not as Administrator. The reason will be explained later.;  , For example: SUBST X: 'D:\Documents\John\Letters'.  You should see a newly created drive letter X:, with which you can access your mapped folder directly.  , To automatically map your folder when your system starts, put the SUBST command in a batch file, and put the batch file in your Autostart folder in the start menu. Advanced users can use the windows task scheduler, however this is not covered here.  These mappings are only created for the user who originally issued the SUBST command. When you login as 'John', and you open a command prompt as 'Administrator' and execute the SUBST command, 'John' will not be able to see any mapped drive letters because the mapping was created for 'Administrator'. This is why you need to open the command prompt as a default user in Windows Vista and Windows 7.

"A college education is not a prerequisite to work as a production assistant, but many recent graduates with degrees in broadcast journalism, communications, and film compete for PA jobs. These degrees are less relevant than actual work experience, but they can help you get your foot in the door.The most relevant Bachelor’s degrees are broadcast journalism, communications, and film. However, a college degree is not required for the field and even a relevant degree might do little to advance your prospects.;  , Shorter training programs, known as 'boot camps,' teach skills important for a PA in a condescended period of time. These are more closely tailored to the specific demands of a PA than college programs and can look great on a resume. These typically cost approximately $200 for a two-day course.  These programs are concentrated in areas with a thriving media industry, like Atlanta, New York, and Los Angeles., The best way to get into the industry is to get experience working in it. Unfortunately, that means you often need to work as an unpaid intern for several months. Try running errands on a local independent film production crew or at a local television station's production department.  Some cable systems will have local origination programming on which they will welcome a volunteer production assistant. They may have an informal (and free) training program, as well.  As a production assistant, you should be willing to work long hours in return for the experience. You might need to work 12-hour days mostly standing up. You will often be required to perform menial tasks, like picking up coffee, and will be judged on how well you perform even the smallest task.Though the job is grueling it doesn’t pay well, usually no more than minimum wage, and sometimes less. To keep yourself motivated you should think about the long-term career opportunities that can develop from a PA job., A production assistant works with people in all roles of production, including the director, assistant director, producer, lighting director, camera operators, talent and extras. You will often be required to perform tasks like answering the phone. That means that you need to be able to express ideas clearly both through written and spoken English.Taking college courses in the humanities will often help you develop your writing skills.  Working in sales or services industries can be a good way to develop your oral communication skills.  One of your principal responsibilities as a PA will be editing video. Each station will use a different type of non-linear editor and will usually be willing to train you in the one that they use. However, you should at least be able to demonstrate that you have some experience editing video.  Programs that channels use include: Avid, Quantel, Final Cut Pro, and Sony.  Production assistants are not generally required to operate the camera, but production assistants can be asked to perform almost any function at the studio when the need arises. Knowing how to operate the camera can give you an advantage. Furthermore, successfully operating the camera when needed can be a ticket to a better position in the future.Studying film in college is a good way to learn about operating the camera. Alternatively, some organizations offer short courses in filmmaking that can help you develop your skills with the camera.  You will need to become familiar with the roles of a typical production crew. Some colleges offering programs in production have free course material available online.  Be fluent in the use of a radio (walkie talkie) and surveillance mic equipment.  Examples of relevant terminology include terms like: “cut,” “dolly,” “framing,” “story board,” and “wipe.”, As a production assistant you will be expected to know something about the content that you report on. If you want to be in sports, you will need to know about sports. If you want to work in news, you will be expected to understand politics. Figure out what field you are interested in and start doing research.  No one is, or should be, a production assistant forever. It pays too poorly to be anything other than a stepping stone to a better career. Thus, you should know what positions you want to move on to and begin preparing yourself for the expectations.  If you can, speak to someone in the field about what the expectations and career trajectories are.  You should keep these on you at all times, because you never know when you will meet someone who will be able to recommend you for your first job in your career in production. Be sure that your networking materials include your cell phone number or a current phone number. Your resume should speak to how you possess the aforementioned skills, including communication, camera operation, work ethic, attention to detail, and video editing.  You will need to demonstrate that you can edit video to get a job as a production assistant. Keep a reel of video that you have edited to share with potential employers. Use your time in college or in a production boot camp to develop such a reel with professional input.If you can, try to have reel ready that it is pertinent to the position you are applying for. Though if you don’t have relevant material it should be fine, because it will still show that you have the basic skills necessary to edit film.  Contact production coordinators, producers, or assistant directors either by telephone or in person. Give them your resume and make a pitch for why you are qualified for the job. If you know anyone in the business, see if they can put in a good word for you.  Leave your resume and card and follow up soon after the first contact. You should follow up periodically thereafter.  You can’t live forever on a PA job. The point of the position is to get experience behind the scenes, to learn the intricacies of production, meet leading figures in the field, and learn from their insights. Whether you are still looking for a PA job or have just gotten one, you should work hard to meet important people in the field.Interacting with people on social media can be a good way to introduce yourself to people in the field.  Look for local events that will likely attract people interested in media.  Never stop looking to meet new people. Talk to people at yoga or the bar. Engage in clubs and activities that expand your social network.  ","get an appropriate degree. look for training programs. intern. prepare yourself to work long hours. develop strong communication skills. learn to edit video. learn how to operate a camera. familiarize yourself with the basic terminology of the industry. learn everything about the content you specialize in. carry your resume and business cards. create a reel. reach out to employers. network.

"Having a game plan for what you and your family will be eating each week can be a game changer. With a meal plan, you will be more likely to eat healthy foods, even if you are on the go. Sit down with your family once a week and make a plan for what you will be eating at each meal during the upcoming week., Once you have your healthy meal plan put together, you will need to make a shopping list. Go through all the recipes you will be making and list all of the ingredients you will need to make your meals. Be sure to go through your pantry, refrigerator, and freezer to see what ingredients you already have on hand., Making sure your kitchen is stocked with healthy food is one of the most important parts of successfully preparing healthy meals. Pick a day that you can make a weekly shopping trip, and make it part of your weekly schedule., When you come home from a long day of work, chopping and preparing ingredients for a healthy dinner can seem overwhelming. You can get ahead of the game by taking an hour or two on the weekend and prepping ingredients for your meals.

"If you already know how to read chord progressions, simply read this step and skip the rest of this section as the chords to 'Happy Birthday' are very simple.  Below is the chord progression to 'Happy Birthday'.Happy Birthday  Hap-py |(C) birth - day to |(G) you. Hap-py | birth - day to |(C) you. Hap-py | birth-day dear |(F) (na-ame). Hap-py |(C) birth - day (G) to |(C) you.  A few important things to note about 'Happy Birthday':  The song uses a 3/4 (waltz) beat. This means that there are three beats per measure and that the quarter note gets one count. This is easy to observe in the first measure: if you follow the lyrics, 'birth - day - to', each syllable gets one beat.  The song starts with two pickup eighth notes. In other words, the 'Hap-py' at the start of the song occurs before the first beat as the chords don't kick in until 'Birth-day'.  You can use any strumming pattern that's comfortable for you. A simple one that works well is to simply use a down strum for each quarter note (three per measure.)  ;  , This chord is played for the whole first measure, starting on the 'birth' syllable of 'birthday'. You don't have to play any chords on 'Happy', since these are pickup notes to the first measure.  An open C major chord is played like this:  Open CHigh E string: Open (0)B string: First fret (1)G string: Open (0)D string: Second fret (2)A string: Third fret (3)Low E string: Not played (X)  You can keep from playing the low E string by muting it with one of your fretting fingers or simply avoiding hitting it with your strumming hand.  Keep playing this chord through the third measure.  An open G major chord is played like this:  Open GHigh E string: Third fret (3)B string: Open (0)G string: Open (0)D string: Open (0)A string: Second fret (2)Low E string: Third fret (3)  , Keep playing this chord through the fourth and fifth measures and the syllables 'Hap - py birth - day dear...'  , This will be the first syllable of the name of the person whose birthday it is. Play this F chord for the whole measure, through the next 'Hap - py' syllables.  An F major chord is played like this:  F MajorHigh E string: First fret (1)B string: First fret (1)G string: Second fret (2)D string: Third fret (3)A string: Third fret (3)Low E string: First fret (1)  Note that the chord above is a barre chord. This means that it uses the side of your index finger to fret all of the strings on the first fret. Beginners can find this difficult to do, so, if you can't quite get it to sound right, try this alternative instead:  'Easy' F MajorHigh E string: First fret (1)B string: First fret (1)G string: Second fret (2)D string: Third fret (3)A string: Not played (X)Low E string: Not played (X)  , Play C on the 'birth - day' syllables and G on the 'to' syllable. In other words, two beats of C and one beat of G.  You may have trouble switching between these two chords so quickly if you're a beginner. Practice this measure by itself and don't give up as you want your finger motions to eventually become second-nature.  For effect, let this final chord ring out.  Congratulations! You've just played 'Happy Birthday.' Practice the steps above until you've gotten the hang of it, then try singing over the chords!  , The melody to 'Happy Birthday' is a simple one that everyone knows, so practicing it is easy and you'll know right away if it sounds wrong. The first two notes (the ones that correspond to 'Hap - py') are both Gs.  The note you'll want to start with here is the one you get by playing the open G string. Play one note for each syllable in 'Hap - py,' like this:  High E string:----------------B string: ---------G string: 0-0---------D string:--------A string:--------Low E string:--------  For this section, since there's not an easy way to represent staff music or tablature on WikiHow, we're going to proceed measure-by-measure. For a traditional inscription of the melody, visit a site like Guitarnick.com or start-playing-guitar.com.,  Each beat gets one note, like this:  High E string:--------B string: ----------1G string: 2--0D string:--------A string:--------Low E string:--------  ,  B gets two beats and the two G eighth notes get one, like this:  High E string:--------B string: 0------G string: --------0-0D string:--------A string:--------Low E string:--------  ,  The third measure is the same as the first, except that the final note is two frets up, like this:  High E string:--------B string: ----------3G string: 2--0D string:--------A string:--------Low E string:--------  ,  The fourth measure is the same as the second, except that the first note is one fret up, like this:  High E string:--------B string: 1------G string: --------0-0D string:--------A string:--------Low E string:--------  ,  The G you start on here is an octave higher than the G you've used earlier. The next two notes descend from this G, like this:  High E string:3--0--B string: --------------1-G string: ---------D string:--------A string:--------Low E string:--------  ,  The B you start on here is made with the open B string and the final Fs are played as eighth notes on the high E string, like this:  High E string:---------1-1-B string: 0--------G string: ----2------D string:--------A string:--------Low E string:--------  ,  Start on the open high E string here, like this:  High E string:0------------------B string: -----1--3------G string: ----------D string:--------A string:--------Low E string:--------  ,, Above, we've used straight eighth notes for each of the 'Hap - py's in the song — that is, eighth notes where each note is played for the same amount of time. However, if you pay attention while you sing the song, you'll probably notice that the eighth notes aren't actually played straight. Rather, they're swung, which means that the first eighth note is a little longer than the second. To play the song more accurately, the 'hap' syllable should be played for a little more time and the 'py' syllable should be played for a little less time than if you were using straight eighths.  In musical terms, we'd say that the first eighth note in each 'Hap - py' is a dotted eighth note and the second is a sixteenth note.  Try singing the song aloud to yourself again. Odds are, you'll naturally stretch out each 'you' and the last syllable of the birthday boy/girl's name. This is a good thing, as it lends the song a little more of an emotional, dramatic quality. If you're not already doing this when you play the song on guitar, try adding it to your playing and it should come easily.  In musical terminology, holding a note at the end of a piece or phrase in this way is called a fermata., The notes and chords above don't make up the only way to play 'Happy Birthday'. In fact, there are several different sets of chords and notes (called 'keys') that you can use to play this song. Though a discussion of what exactly a key is is beyond the scope of this article, it's easy to find music for 'Happy Birthday' in different keys by using a search engine query like 'Happy Birthday guitar keys.'  For example, here's another way to play 'Happy Birthday:'  Happy Birthday  Hap-py |(G) birth - day to |(D) you. Hap-py | birth - day to |(G) you. Hap-py | birth-day dear |(C) (na-ame). Hap-py |(G) birth - day (D) to |(G) you.  In the examples above, we've only used major (happy-sounding) chords. In reality, you can also add chords called 7 chords to this song to give it a slightly more complex, almost bluesy feel. If you want to do this, simply change the chord in the third measure and the second chord in the seventh measure to the 7 version of that chord so that a D becomes a D7, a G becomes a G7, and so on.  For example, here is the original chord progression for 'Happy Birthday' from the top of this article with 7 chords substituted in:  Happy Birthday  Hap-py |(C) birth - day to |(G) you. Hap-py |(G7) birth - day to |(C) you. Hap-py | birth-day dear |(F) (na-ame). Hap-py |(C) birth - day (G7) to |(C) you.  For reference, a G7 chord is played like this:  Open G7High E string: First fret (1)B string: Open (0)G string: Open (0)D string: Open (0)A string: Second fret (2)Low E string: Third fret (3)  ","study the chord progression before you start playing. play one measure of c. 'happy birthday' starts on a c major open chord. play two measures of g. on the first beat of the second measure (starting on the 'you' syllable), play an open g major chord. play two measures of c. next, on the syllable 'you', play an open c chord. play one measure of f. on the first beat of the sixth measure, play an f major chord. play two beats of c and one beat of g. the seventh measure is the only one in the song that isn't the same chord for the whole measure. end on c. end the song by playing an open c major chord on the final 'you.', start with two g pickup notes. play a-g-c in the first measure. play b-g-g in the second measure. play a-g-d in the third measure. play c-g-g in the fourth measure. play g-e-c in the fifth measure. play b-a-f-f in the sixth measure. play e-c-d in the seventh measure. end on c. finally, hit the first fret on the b string to bring the song to a close, like this: high e string:----------------b string: 1--------g string: ----------d string:--------a string:--------low e string:-------- , swing the 'hap - py' eighth notes. let each 'you' note ring a little longer than normal. try playing in different keys. try substituting 7 chords in the third and seventh measures.

"A hamster's teeth and nails do not stop growing. This is why hamsters need chews and sand to keep their teeth and nails filed down. Occasionally, you may need to have your hamster's teeth or nails trimmed if they become overgrown. Unless you're professionally trained, it's best to take your hamster into the vet when he needs a trim. You want to make sure the procedure is done safely and your hamster is not hurt in the process., Hamsters are not always friendly to new pets. If you're going to introduce a second hamster, do so when your current hamster is still young. Also, do not place a male and female in the same cage unless you want them to breed. Hamsters are very fertile and a female can give birth to 3 to 18 babies every 30 days.If you do add a new hamster, you should spend several days introducing them. Keep your hamsters in separate cages where they can see each other for a few days. When you do place them in the same cage, keep an eye on them to make sure there's no fighting. You might want to wear protective gloves during the introduction. In the event of a fight, you may have to separate the hamsters., As stated, a wheel is an essential part of your hamster's health. However, you want to make sure your hamster's wheel is big enough for safe use. Small wheels can cause back problems from your hamster bending his back to fit the wheel. If you have a larger hamster, go for a bigger sized wheel.At minimum, look for a wheel of at least 6.5 inches. Certain types of hamster, like Syrian hamsters, tend to grow very big. In this case, you should get a wheel that's at lest 8 inches., You should never let your hamster out of his cage unsupervised. If you use a hamster ball or similar device, only allow your hamster to roam in it when you're watching. Accidents and mishaps can occur, resulting in injury and even death. Your hamster should never be allow to roam the house without supervision.  ","trim teeth and nails regularly. take precautions when introducing a new hamster. get the right wheel. supervise your hamster when you let him out of his cage. "
"Your doctor may recommend that you take certain medications on a regular basis to help reduce the inflammation and pain caused by the arthritis. Some of these medications, like ibuprofen (an anti-inflammatory), does not require a prescription and can be taken several times a day. The following medications have been known to relieve the pain and inflammation caused by arthritis:Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs — otherwise known as NSAIDs, these types of medication include ibuprofen (e.g Advil) and acetaminophen (e.g. Tylenol). Most NSAIDs are available in some form as over-the-counter medications, but you can also get a prescriptions for stronger versions of NSAIDS (i.e. Tylenol 3s and 4s, etc.)Corticosteroids — mainly used to control inflammation. These drugs are administered with an injection. Oral corticosteroids may be given for rheumatoid arthritis.Analgesics — target only pain relief and do not control inflammation and include acetaminophen (i.e. Tylenol). Analgesics are also available in a cream form (e.g. Voltaren) and can be rubbed into the skin around the area that’s painful. Low level analgesics (like regular strength Tylenol) and a variety of the cream versions, are available over-the-counter. Stronger versions of analgesics are available by prescription.Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs — otherwise known as DMARDs, these drugs actually work to modify your arthritis. DMARDs are available only by prescription.Biologic response modifiers — used mainly for rheumatoid arthritis, they work to block specific steps in the inflammation process of your body. Biologics are only available by prescription.Osteoporosis medications — help to slow bone loss or help to build new bone. There are a number of drugs that are used to treat osteoporosis and all are available only by prescription.;  , If anti-inflammatory medications are not successful, your doctor may recommend getting regular injections at the site of your arthritis. These injections usually include an anesthetic and a steroid, and they can last for several months.While you may find injections successful, they are only meant to be a temporary measure and cannot be continued indefinitely.  Splints can also be used on your hands and wrists in addition to, or instead of, medication or injections. A splint will help support and stabilize your hand or wrist in order to reduce the stress placed upon it by certain activities.Splints are normally worn for a limited time every day, as opposed to all day, every day. Most arthritis sufferers tend to use splints when performing specific activities which may cause them more pain, such as typing, driving, painting, gardening, etc.  Unfortunately medications and injections do not always work as well as we’d like. Another option to consider is hand surgery. The exact type of surgery will be catered to your specific situation, but the main goal of the surgery is to reduce the pain over the long-term.Surgery where the joint can be saved or reconstructed is always the first, and best, option. However, if it isn’t possible to save the joint as is, your doctor may perform a joint replacement or a fusion.  Fusing the joint(s) together can significantly reduce the amount of pain you experience, but it will permanently remove any movement you have in that joint. The fact that the joint cannot move is how the pain is eliminated, as the joint can no longer rub together.  Joint replacement involves replacing your original joint with a man-made joint. Man-made joints usually consist of plastic, metals or ceramic and can last a very long time. A joint replacement will not only eliminate the pain you’re experiencing, but it will allow you to continue to use your hand normally.  No matter what type of surgery you may have, you will need to perform hand therapy (a type of physical therapy) afterwards. Initially after surgery you may be asked to wear a splint full-time in order to limit the movement of your hand while it heals. You may also need to change the activities you perform until your hand or wrist is strong enough.Most people can recommence normal activities approximately 3 months after surgery. However, the speed of your recovery is high dependent on the effort you put towards taking care of your hand or wrist.  ","take recommended medications. treat pain with injections. splint your hands and/or wrists. consider surgery for your affected hand. attend after surgery hand therapy. "
"With a job you hate, love, or are indifferent to, it can be difficult to remember the good portions of it and the reasons you have to be grateful for the job. Practicing gratitude about your job can make it easier to cope with it if you hate it, and remind you of all its excellent qualities when you are more positive towards it.  Keep a gratitude journal that is only for your job. Every day come up with at least 3 things that you are grateful for about your job. This could be something like 'sun was coming through my work window' or 'the cute delivery girl smiled at me' or 'I got a raise today.' Even if you aren't feeling particularly grateful for your job that day, try to find just 3 things that you can focus on.  try to come up with ways that this job is good for you. It could be that it brings you enough money to buy that new book series you wanted, or is close to your house so you don't have to commute far.;  , Even if it's an especially difficult job to like, having at least one bright spot to look forward to during your work day can make all the difference. Even if this bright spot happens to be your lunch hour.This step goes beyond simply finding things to be grateful for. If you dread going to work in the morning, focus on that bright spot so that you convince yourself into being more excited for work.  For example: before you get up in the morning (especially if it's early and your alarm has just gone off), lie there for a moment and call up that bright spot (getting to see and flirt with your cute coworker). During the day, when that bright spot happens, stop and think 'I am grateful.'  , Perhaps now you have experience dealing with a difficult boss, or you are more effective at time management because the job has forced you to be creative. There's an opportunity to gain insight in every position you have, whether that position is high or low, even if the only insight you gain is that you don't like the job.  Some people focus on the skills they develop during a job because they are beneficial in helping them climb up the career ladder. If you're stuck at a lower-level advertising job where you do all the work and get none of the credit, for example, you can take solace in the idea that the skills you're gaining now will eventually help you get a better position.  Others focus on knowledge they gain while at the job. Let's face it, a lot of jobs aren't the greatest. The pay is low, the hours are bad, and the stress is high. If the only knowledge you take away from the job is that it's not a job you want to be doing the rest of your life, that's important. Use that knowledge as motivation in finding a new job — something that you actually like doing.  Figure out why the work you do is important and what your presence means to your place of employment. There is always something that you bring to the table, even if it's only your strong work ethic and quick sandwich making skills.  Remember, each person who is part of a workplace brings something important to their job. Focusing on what you do that is important will help you better value your job and your place in it.  Remind yourself of the importance of the job itself. Every job is important if you look at it from the right angle. If you work in a coffee shop, for example, tell yourself how the people who come in are getting a needed pick-me-up and they wouldn't get that without you and the work you do.  You're not going to love, or even enjoy, every single second of your workday or every single task that you're asked to do. If you're pushing yourself to 'love' your work regardless of the more difficult aspect, you'll be more likely to find yourself dwelling on the difficult aspects, instead.  Give yourself permission to have days where you simply don't want to go to work, or don't enjoy yourself there, even when you're practicing gratitude and finding bright spots. The problem is when that is the only way you look at your job. Occasional down days and irritations are bound to crop up.  When something happens that irritates or frustrates you, remind yourself that the specific situation is what is frustrating, not necessarily the job itself. This will make you less likely to descend into a downward spiral where you begin to focus only on the irritating aspects of the job.  Sometimes you need to do something for yourself that can relate to your work. This could be anything from writing blog posts about the service industry, to developing a new way of structuring your company.Consider what might help make your job, or further marketability, better. Is there a better way to do your job? Is there a way to do things faster? Could you make the copier work better and break less often? Doing any of these things will demonstrate your creativity and your initiative and will give you a purpose.  Sometimes there are ways to improve your job so that it goes from terrible or soul-sucking to much more manageable. This may mean having a talk with your boss, it could mean cutting down on your hours, and so on.  For example: if it's a coworker or your boss who is making your life miserable at work, you may want to have a private talk with them. They may not realize what they're doing is affecting you so negatively. Even if they do realize, calling them on their behavior (especially if you can offer reasons why they need to change) can do a lot to improving things for you.  Set boundaries. If you work too many hours (or lots of overtime for which you aren't really being paid) discuss this with your supervisor. If there is an unspoken rule that you have to work overtime, don't fall into the trap.  Sometimes you really have to just quit the job that is sucking your soul from your body. Start quietly looking for a new job, maybe in an area that you're more suited for, or something you might prefer doing.  Decide if you really can't stay at the job you're at. This means that the job is affecting your mental or physical health, or if you're being abused by management or a coworker, etc. if you've tried to improve your situation and can't, it's probably time to move on.  Try to avoid leaving your job until you have another job, but remember, there won't always be a safety net into which you can leap. You may have to be prepared to scrape yourself off the bottom, if things really don't work out. This does not mean you should stay at a job that you truly cannot stand.  Even if you don't always like the people with whom you work, it creates a good atmosphere when you find ways to avoid taking them for granted. Just realizing and acknowledging how each person contributes (even if it is only a little!) to the company can make a huge difference.  Say 'thank you' to the people you work with. It can be for more general things, like they cleaned up in the kitchen after using it, or it can be for the work they've done. Say things like 'Thank you so much, John, for putting in all that extra work on our presentation. You've really make the presentation so much better,' or 'Thank you, Jane, for fixing the copier yet again. You really know how to work that thing!'  Acknowledge each person's value. Each person who works at a place of employment has intrinsic value, as well as value to do with their job. The customer service rep who answers the phone all day is the face of the company to the customers, the dishwashers in the back kitchen is making it so that you have clean dishes to use throughout the day, the person who cleans the bathrooms makes the work environment habitable. Pay attention to all the people in your organization.  Instead of a generic 'Hey, how ya doing?' get in the habit of saying 'Hey, Abby, how's life treating you?' It turns out that a part of our brains lights up when we hear our own names being spoken, increasing the warmth we feel for others.Being happy at work in large part depends on being happy with coworkers, and your relationship with coworkers can be improved simply by slipping a person's name into a sentence. So do it: Use names more often and see work get better.  To create a more positive environment that's better to work in you have to find encouragement and support in the people with whom you work. You're going to have to see and cooperate with these people every single day, so finding ways to do that will make your life there much happier.  Foster trust by starting each interaction with the basic assumption that you can trust your coworker. This means trusting them to do their job, trusting them to work positively with you. Doing this will create the expectation of trust, and make your coworkers more likely to step up and earn your trust. Will people still fail your trust? Of course, but this way you're more likely to foster more trust, and those times when people don't follow through will be aberrations.If there are people that you don't like or who have a negative impact on you, minimize the time you spend with them as much as possible. Don't be rude. For example, if Sally, rude office gossip, comes into your workspace, give her a few minutes of your time and then say, politely, 'Hey, I really have to get this finished. I'll catch you with you later.'  Do what you want others to do. This means doing your work in a timely manner, being on time to work, and not passing around nasty or mean gossip about your coworkers. Modeling this behavior (without telling people they should act more like you, and doing stuck-up things like that) can make people more likely to want to act that way themselves., Your job might be something like cleaning hotel rooms, or serving people sandwiches, or it could be something big in banking. Whatever it is, try to find make something inspiring out it, even if it's only inspiring to you. You get to decide whether the work you do is important.  Look at the people who inspire you, including famous people. For example: you don't have to turn into Mother Theresa, but you could try giving a helping hand to some of the struggling people in your company (like offering to mentor them, or giving them positive feedback, etc.).  Start a creative project, at your job or outside of (but link to) it. A good way to keep inspiration flowing is to have a creative project that you're working on. This could be something as simple as trying new ways of doing your work (turning the sandwiches you make into works of art; improving your latte making skills until you can make coffee art; reorganizing your cubicle so it is more conducive to working).  Even if you don't exactly enjoy what you do, finding ways to have fun with your colleagues can make the work go by much faster. You don't have to slack on your job, or be cruel, to have fun, either.  Have a whiteboard where you write down the funniest things that people have said that day (as long as you aren't repeating mean or rude things).  Start a really bad joke contest and have some sort of silly prize for the winner. Again, avoid cruel jokes (racist jokes, sexist jokes, rape jokes, etc.).  What we do at work has meaning at home. And how we feel at home gets translated into how we feel at work. It's a cycle, where one part of the equation influences the other. Focusing on maintaining a good 'work/life balance' will help you make both parts even better. Here are some ideas about what you can do outside of work to make the time that you do spend in the office even better.  People have a tendency to get wrapped up in their own lives, especially in their jobs. Suddenly you find that it's been over a year since you last spoke to your friends, because all your energy and attention has been going into staying late at work to get that promotion.  Having a strong community of friends and family is incredibly important to your overall health. People who have strong connections tend to live longer and feel more fulfilled in their lives, which in turn make them happier in their work lives, as well.  Set up a time with your friends each month when you can meet. It can be something like meeting for breakfast every first Friday of the month. Then the date is on people's calendars and, as it's monthly, if they can't come that month, they can come at a later date.  Make sure you're spending time with your family (spouse, children, etc.). Even if you're tired, taking some time to ask them about their day and helping out with the household chores can make home life much happier and more fulfilling.  Most people aren't going to find a way to incorporate their passions into their jobs. Don't let this mean your passions fall by the wayside because you're focusing exclusively on work. Find ways to pursue them outside of your job, so you don't need your job to fulfill that need.  For example, if you're really into rock climbing, you don't necessarily need to be a rock climbing instructor, or somehow do that as your job to be happy and fulfilled at work. You could do a job that helps fund your passion, or that allows you to take vacations to go on longer climbing trips.  Do something with art or something creative. Take up knitting, or participate in some free drawing classes (you can sometimes find free life drawing at colleges). This will help you feel like you're accomplishing something important, will give you a creative outlet (if you're not getting it at your job).  Trying out new things in your life can make it easier to handle the surprises life has a way of throwing your way. It's also a great way to build inspiration in all different areas of your life, including in your life.  Doing new things doesn't necessarily mean spending piles of money on a worldwide trip, or skydiving class (although if you can do that and want to, great!). It means trying out different things in your community that challenge you: taking a cooking class, or going to free lectures at your local university, doing guerrilla gardening, and so on.  You can also do things like work at a soup kitchen or shelter. These can get you out of your comfort zone, remind of the positive things in your own life (like food, a roof over your head, your health, a job, etc.), while doing positive work in your community.  Stresses at work and in your life can cause you to get ill, both in body and in mind. Find ways to make sure that you're getting the support and healthy practices that you need to keep going through the stress and through the potential difficulties.  Exercise is incredibly important to your health, physical and mental. It releases chemicals like endorphins which help you feel happier. Exercise can ease depression and anxiety and it can boost your energy level. Try for at least 30 minutes of exercise each day. If you are feeling sleepy during your work shift, get up and move around (walk the stairs in your building, take a walk around the block, do some jumping jacks). It will work better than an energy drink to keep you going to the end of your shift.  Eating right means you're putting food in your body that helps to fuel it and make it work at optimum levels. Frequent consumption of foods that are sugary or high in salts and saturated fats, can make your mood worse. Go for protein (meat, nuts, soy, etc.) and lots of fruits and veggies. For carbohydrates, go for the better ones (brown rice, sprouted wheat, oats).  Get enough sleep. Most people in the United States (especially those who work) are operating on a sleep deficit, which will make you less effective and happy at your work and in your life. Try for at least 8 hours each night, the more hours you get in before midnight the better rested you'll be. Turn off all electronics at least 30 minutes before bedtime.  A lot of people never end up able to, or willing to, take their vacation days, even if their jobs offer paid vacations for their employees. Vacations give you the distance from your job that can help you decide whether it's a good fit for you, if it's really as bad as you sometimes think. Or they can simply rejuvenate you so that you can get back to work with a better attitude.If you can't really take a whole vacation, try for at least a few days off each year, where you simply allow yourself to relax and you take care of yourself.

"Planning a killer house party is a lot easier when you’ve got accomplices to spread the time and responsibilities out to. Talk to your friends, and see who is interested in helping. This will make things a lot easier on you. Consider the following:  Who has what responsibilities. Try to spread the responsibilities out based on who is good at doing what.  Who gets the cash. If it’s your home, you should probably get the largest cut of the cash. Consider this and talk to your friends ahead of time so everyone knows what they’re going to get out of the whole affair.  Who has money and other supplies to bring to the table. You might want to include a friend who has a band or a good sound system in the party planning. Also consider people who have party planning experience and might have kegs or other important supplies.  If you've got roommates, consider asking them to share the responsibilities of holding a 'rent party.' Then, you'll all work toward the common goal of making enough money for rent that month.;  , With house parties, location is everything. After all, the main function of the event is to gather a lot of people. You’ll need to consider a few things to make sure you’ve got a good location:  How big is your house? Do you have enough space for the number of guests you’ll be entertaining.  Do you have an appropriate “main party” area. This could be a basement, a large living room, or a back yard.  Do you have the permission of other relevant individuals (family, roommates, landlords) to have a large party at your home., While the home is the most important part of throwing a house party, there are a number of important accessories that will help make your party. Remember, your party is all about making sure your guests are occupied and entertained. You don’t want anyone being bored or leaving. A boring party that lacks proper accessories could undermine your ability to have other parties later.  A good stereo system. You’ll need a system that can fill your home or backyard with sound. Don’t go overboard, though. You don’t want your neighbors calling the cops and you don’t want to completely drown out conversation.  A beer pong table and cups. Beer pong is one of the best ways to entertain your guests. Make sure you have all of the appropriate supplies.  A poke table, cards, and chips, for more sophisticated crowds.  A pool table or some trivia games.  The money to buy or rent a beer keg and other alcohol. You won’t make any money if people have to bring their own alcohol. Because of this, you’ll want to make sure you have the money to pay for alcohol in advance of the party., Figuring out how many people you can accommodate is extremely important in the whole planning process. You don’t want to go ahead and plan a party for 500 people if your house and backyard can really only accommodate 100. Consider:  Seating. A small portion of people will be sitting at any given time. So don’t plan for more than 20% of your guests to be sitting at a given moment.  Parking. Parking is extremely important, as most of your guests will probably arrive by car. Make sure you’ve got enough parking for the number of people you plan on hosting.  Space. Take stock of the sorts of rooms and outside space you have to entertain. Can you fit 20 people comfortably into a living room? How many people can be standing around your pool in your backyard?, Before you move forward, you need to put together a preliminary budget and make sure you have the money to lay down in advance of the party. Don’t cheap out here. You have to have all of the supplies to entertain your guests, especially if they’re going to be paying to get you’re your party. Consider paying for:  Alcohol.  Renting equipment (kegs, a sound system, or more).  Contingency money if anything is broken at your home. This might just come out of your profits.  Let your neighbors know that you’ll be throwing a big party. Having your neighbors on board, or at least in the know, will make your party experience much better and will eliminate a few potential problems. Ask them:  If there is a particular weekend that would be better for them.  If they’re also planning on having an event on the weekend you’re planning on.  If they’d like to come and join the party., When planning a party, you might get wrapped up with the big things like booking a band or picking a beer selection and easily forget about small things that will make your party a seamless experience for everyone. Don’t forget about things that seem small, but are critical. Remember to:  Provide plenty of garbage cans.  Have lots of coolers with ice.  Provide ashtrays for cigarette butts., Before you hold your party, make sure you know local ordinances when it comes to noise. After all, you don’t want to get shut down by the cops for having your music too loud. Consider the following:  Know if there are ordinances that restrict noise levels on certain days and times in residential neighborhoods.  Communication with your neighbors is key. Even if there are ordinances, you’ll most likely be able to party on if you talk to your neighbors ahead of time and let them know what you’re doing. The best bet is to promise to turn the music down at midnight, and disperse the party by 2 A.M.  Invite your neighbors as a way of heading off alienating. They might even want to contribute.  Call your local police department to see if there have been any noise-related disturbances reported recently., Advertising will be key to having a large party that makes you some profit. After all, you want to maximize your profit and get as many people as you can fit into your house at one time. There are a number of ways to get the word out about your house party:  Social media. Consider social networking sites like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat to get the word out. Create an event page, and invite all of your friends and have them invite all of your friends. Make sure you include specifics and warn people that you’ll be charging.  Word of mouth. Tell all of your friends and have them tell their friends. Talk to people in your classes and at work and invite them. Tell everyone that they are welcome to bring as many friends as they want.  Flyers. Put up some flyers around campus or in your community advertising your party. Be careful with this though, as you might have some people come and try to take advantage of you or your guests., After you’ve made sure you have a good house and other supplies and advertised, you’ll need to prep your space. You need to make sure that the house is ready for your party and that spaces you want closed off are indeed closed off, and spaces you want people to hang out in are inviting.  Remove valuables that can be easily stolen and lock them in a closed off bedroom.  Move furniture out of the way in larger rooms so that people can walk around.  Find some extra chairs and make sure you’ve got enough seating for your 20%.  Setup a bar and snack area. If you can, do this in at least two different locations so you don’t have everyone hanging around one area., In order to have a really good party, you’ve got to make sure that the cops don’t shut your party down because of underage drinking. Because of this, you need to take precautions to avoid supplying alcohol to underage guests. This doesn’t mean you have to exclude people under 21, just don’t supply alcohol to them.  Make sure you know the laws in your area.  Don’t supply alcohol to minors.  Post signs that say no underage drinking., At house parties, entertainment and music is key. You need to make sure your guests are entertained and are entertained with quality music that they’re into. Hiring a band or a DJ might be something that makes your party more appealing to people who are on the fence about coming.  Consider hiring a local band that people around your town know and love. This might lure people to the party.  Get a friend to have their band play. It doesn’t have to be for the whole time, but just for an hour or less.  Find a DJ or a friend who enjoys playing DJ. This way, you’ll have someone dedicated to making sure the music is spot on for your guests., If you’re planning on having a large party with people you don’t know, you should consider hiring someone to manage security at your home. Most of the time, just the presence of an intimidating person in a “security” shirt might ward off potential problems., The best house parties are parties where people don’t just get trashed, but enjoy drinking drinks that they like in a fun atmosphere. To achieve this, make sure you supply drinks people actually want to drink. Consider the following:  Prepare a signature mixed drink. This might even be hunch punch.  Supply jello shots.  Pick a solid middle-of-the-road beer that everyone will like. If you want, you can pair a solid beer keg with a really cheap one and give people the choice., One way of raising money for your party might be to invite investors beforehand by using crowd sourcing websites like Kickstarter and Crowdtilt. This way, you can get people to either donate or invest funds before you've even had the party. This will help reduce the amount of your own money you will need to use to buy party supplies and secure entertainment.  Ask people to contribute as a 'donation' via crowd sourcing.  Ask people to contribute as investors via crowd sourcing. You can pay back upfront investments later with funds obtained at the party.  Ask people to sponsor a specific aspect of the party, like hiring a band or buying a keg.  Consider holding a couple raffles with the winning prize being a good bottle of liquor. This is one way to get people to pay you a little money for the hopes of a huge reward. It might also add excitement and entertainment value to your party, as you could market it to your guests as a main event.  If you’ve got a DJ, have them announce the raffle and then announce the winner.  Take a bottle of Grey Goose and try to sell 100 tickets for $1 each. The balance between cost and the tickets you sell is your profit.  Check with local laws about raffling alcohol., If you’ve got a DJ, a band, or are just playing songs yourself, consider getting your guests to pay for requests. You could ask them to pay as little as $1 a song. Over the course of a 3 or 4 hour party, you could potentially make some decent money just off of song requests.  Make sure all of your party supplies – snacks and alcohol – are purchased as inexpensively as you can. Don’t settle for the closest liquor store or supermarket. Actively seek out places where you can buy your supplies for little money.  If you’re in a city, county, or state, that levies high taxes on alcohol, consider traveling to a nearby/neighboring place that has lower taxes. This could be substantial depending on where you are.  Call suppliers. If you’re planning a party for 300 people, chances are you’ll need a few kegs. Call suppliers and liquor stores and try to get the lowest prices.  Buy cheap, but don’t cheap out. Don’t buy the cheapest brand of beer and liquor. Some people won’t like it, and won’t come back next time. Instead, find a “middle” beer/liquor that appeals to the most people possible., Charging for admission, at the door, is one of the easiest ways to make your party pay. However, there are a few pitfalls in this approach. The likelihood is that people will be coming and going in and out of your house and backyard all night. You can’t really expect to stop them each time they go in and out. Consider:  Giving out wristbands to people who have paid. This way, you’ll be able to identify people who have paid and people who have not.  Making sure alcohol is supervised. If you’ve given out wristbands, and you’ve got someone pouring drinks, you’ll easily be able to stop people from freeloading off of your liquor who have not paid. This approach also has the added bonus of weeding out underage drinkers.  Providing food in addition to alcohol and other drinks. If you charge for admission, make sure that admission is worth it (otherwise people won’t pay). Relatively inexpensive hotdogs and hamburgers could go a long way in enticing people to pay up to get in.  Know the laws in your area. Charging for admission to a house party might create liability for yourself., Let your friends and other guests know that the goal of the party is to raise money for your rent that month. This is a good way to getting people to volunteer donations, as they'll not just be funding their own fun for the night, but they'll be helping you out in general.  Pass around a jug or bowl at the party for donations.  Ask friends to chip in whatever they can for the cost of the party.  Make sure that the party is worth it, as some of your friends might be in hard times of their own, and won't take kindly to be asked for money if you have not supplied alcohol, food, and entertainment.  Charging for alcohol is at house parties is illegal in many places in the United States unless you have a license that allows you to do so. One way around this (in many areas) is to ask for donations for alcohol. This has advantages and disadvantages. It will help you with some people might not want to pay for a party they might not stay at. However, you’ll also run into people who won’t want to donate, and you could lose money.  Know the laws in your area.  People might circumvent you and bring their own alcohol – then you won’t make any money.  You’ll need someone always standing by the alcohol to collect donation money., One way to try to turn a profit from your house party is to hold a tournament and charge for playing. Entice your guests with a substantial prize, like a bottle of liquor or tickets to a concert if they win. Whatever money is left after you pay for the prize will be profit. Consider:  Beer pong.  Poker.  Pool.  Trivia., Perhaps most importantly, your party should be a good time for you and your guests. While profit might be your priority, why have a party if you’re not going to have fun? Enjoy the part, enjoy the moment, and enjoy the fact that you are making all of this fun possible for other people. And in the end, your party might help pay your rent next month!  ","find a couple friends to help plan the party. make sure you have a good house or location for your party. gather important accessories and resources for the party. determine how many people you can host. put together a budget. talk to your neighbors. make sure you have the small and basic things. educate yourself about local noise ordinances. advertise your party. preparing the space. consider the law and the consequence of underage drinking. hire a band or a disc jockey. hire someone to manage security. have drinks people want to drink. use crowd sourcing websites to fund your party before it begins. raffle off liquor. sell songs. buy cheap. charge for admission. frame your party as a 'rent party.', ask for donations for alcohol. hold a tournament of some sort. enjoy your party.

"Flowers are always appreciated as a table decoration and spring is an ideal time to indulge in a few favorites, like tulips and daffodils. While you could simply stick them into a vase, arranging the flowers in an interesting way can improve their impact. Some ideas include:  Find a glass vase. Place glass pebbles in an Easter color (use clear if you don't like the colors) at the base. Then arrange a row of peeps facing outward around the jar. Insert a bunch of flowers at the top. Since adding water is not a great idea with the peeps in the jar, this arrangement should be made just before placing on the table and then the flowers can be returned to water after the meal. (Note: candies in Easter colors can be substituted for the glass pebbles.)  Arrange flowers around a cake stand (see above).  Find a nest basket and fill it with flowers. Use a low, round vase to place the flowers in, or simply cut the flowers down low and place in just prior to adding to the table.  Use artificial flowers in an arrangement if you can't get real flowers.  ","place flowers as the centerpiece. "
"Toy blocks and other construction toys help with creativity, and sharpen crucial skills like motor and spatial skills. The purpose of a block is to build and create something larger than the block itself and is a great metaphor for life as a whole. Give your child a set of blocks and play with them, watching and helping as they create various structures.Try to find blocks of all different colors, shapes and sizes.  Don’t make assumptions. Instead of saying “Are you building a house?” say “What are you making?”  Begin incorporating blocks at around the age that your child can sit up and hold things alone, perhaps around 9 months of age.;  , Though you should play with your toddler often, you should still allow them to do so on their own most of the time. As the adult, you might tend to take over or direct their play more than you might realize, which can stifle their creativity since they will rely on you for directives. Instead, set time where they can play on their own terms apart from you.This could be while you are cooking or cleaning or enjoying some time to yourself.  Keep them safe, however. Childproof your home to give yourself peace of mind while they are playing alone. Check on them every few minutes or allow them to play in the room that you are in.  Though you should not always manage their play, you can give them certain ideas to help spark their own creativity. Encourage your child to ‘pretend play’ by assigning them a role like “doctor” and you serving as the “patient” or by allowing them to choose the scenario. This will allow them expand their imagination by imagining themselves to be a different person.This is a also a good way to encourage cooperative play and help develop social skills.  They can pretend play with their siblings or friends, as well.  Allow them to use props for the pretending like costumes, pots, blocks, etc.  Though playing indoors can be fun, there is a whole world outside that will offer them far more to explore. Allow them to go outside for at least 30 minutes daily when the weather is nice. You can even take them for a walk in the neighborhood., Though it is nice for your toddler to play with you or to play alone, playing with other children their age can really help to spark their imagination. They will also learn to develop interpersonal and conflict resolution skills, as well. Contact your friends who have children around the same age or other parents at the daycare/school your child attends.You might say “Hey, I was wondering if you wanted to let Isaiah come over on Saturday for a couple of hours to play with Frederick?”  You can also schedule playdates online through Meetup groups and by registering for local community toddler activity classes.  In addition to blocks, there are several others toys that you can get for your child to spark their imagination including:  Art kits  Dress up clothes  Small instruments  A magnifying glass  Clay or Play Doh  Legos  , Another way to spark your child’s imagination is by reading stories to them. These stories allow your child to think about a reality beyond their own and also to visualize the story as you read it. Encouraging a love for reading at a young age can help to foster a lifelong development of imagination and creativity. Choose stories that they can relate to as well as those very different or out of the ordinary.Allow them to select the book every other night.  Tell them stories. You can even try trading off lines or allowing them to fill in the blank. For instance say “Once upon a time there was a beautiful girl named ___ who lived in a ___.”  , Teach them to think outside of the box by using everyday items to create something new and unexpected. Use chair cushions and blankets to make a fort. Use pots and pans to make music. Doing so will encourage them to employ similar inventive ideas., In order to encourage your child to explore, you must model that for them. Try new foods as a family, go to a new park, or try a different route going home from their school. Foster a culture of exploration in them at a young age and they will develop an inquisitive personality and imaginative brain.Make sure to maintain a regular structure so that they can integrate the new experiences. Too much inconsistency and newness can be disorienting and unhealthy for a toddler.  Though technology can be helpful at times in fostering imagination, it can also take up too much mental space and prevent you from thinking creatively. Limit and monitor the amount of TV your child is watching and avoid providing them with games on a tablet.Letting your toddler play with others and physical objects has been proven to be better for development.Allow electronic use for a maximum of two hours per day.  Model good behavior by limiting your own cellphone and TV use while they are awake.  To encourage your toddler’s imagination, step outside of always being the “serious adult.” Wear a tiara while you do chores to make your toddler laugh. Get into character during random moments like dinner time. Use a different voice sometimes. This will teach your child about how flexible their own personality is., Children with imaginary friends tend to be better at tasks that involve imagining how someone else might think and also tend to engage more with peers socially.If your toddler should have an imaginary friend, don’t shun or discourage them. Instead, accept this and allow them to explore their imagination fully.Imaginary friends are seen most often in only children.  When you are selecting a daycare or preschool for your child, be as peculiar as possible. Many schools offer art classes or even teach a second language, so you should try to choose programs like this to foster your child’s creative mind.Read reviews online or talk to your friends who have older children about what they did.  At an early age, expose your child to different cultures and experiences. Take them to museums and art galleries. Take them to festivals in your area. Learn about other cultures and encourage your child to do the same.Expose them to different activities, such as music and dance. The more they experience, the more you can see which activities pique their curiosity and interest to pursue further.  Look in your local newspaper or on social media to find upcoming cultural events that are kid-friendly.  Though it is important to teach your child about proper dress, you should give your child some choice in what they put on their bodies. Doing so reinforces the idea that their opinion matters and can be used to shift how they look and what they do, which encourages imagination. If they want to wear an outfit that is a bit strange or mismatched, allow them to do so every so often.Allow them to dress as they like while at home, as well.  ","encourage the use of blocks. avoid managing their play. encourage pretend play. get them out of the house. schedule playdates. purchase imaginative toys. read to them before bed. reinvent everyday household items. explore new things as a family. unplug from tv and other electronics. be silly. accept their imaginary friend. carefully select their preschool. expose them to the arts. be flexible with their attire.

"These systems deter break-ins and crime because they offer a direct line to emergency services from inside your home, whether you are home or away. If burglars notice that your home is equipped with a home security system, they might pass on your house and move on to an easier target.Only share your home security code with individuals whom you absolutely trust. If you think someone untrustworthy has obtained the code, change it as soon as possible.  Choose a home security system with a lighted motion sensor. When these systems detect movement, they turn on flood lighting, making it easy to see what or who is approaching your home.Some home security systems involve cameras. Be sure to invest in a high definition camera, so that if your home is ever burglarized and the cameras capture photos or video of the perpetrator, the images will be clear enough to give a good picture of the burglar.  Don’t give burglars the opportunity to hide or lurk outside your home. Keep bushes and shrubbery trimmed and leave your porch light on, if possible. You want your home to be as uninviting to criminals as you can make it., While everyone loves a bright, airy space, window coverings are important to install so that your belongings aren’t on display for potential burglars. It’s especially important to keep your window coverings closed at night when it’s easiest for prowlers to look into your home for things they might want to steal when you’re gone., This is a basic but very important safety precaution. Before you leave your home or go to bed for the night be sure that all your doors and windows are locked, including your garage door, if you have one.This applies to your car, as well. Be sure that all your windows are closed and any valuables are out of sight or locked in the trunk.  Timers help you control when your lights and TV turn on and off when you aren’t home. This gives the illusion of someone being home and can help deter potential home break-ins.Many timers can be programmed remotely with your cellphone and some even have a battery backup in case of a power failure., Offering personal information on your mailbox or exterior of your home invites stalkers and burglars to learn who lives at your address. For safety and anonymity do not advertise your name on the exterior of your home., If they keep an eye on your home while you’re gone, ask them to watch for any suspicious activity. Authorize them to report any strange activity or suspicious individuals to police or the neighborhood watch group in your absence.  If you’ll be gone for more than a week, consider having the post office hold your mail and hire a teenager in the neighborhood to mow your lawn. An overgrown lawn with packages piling up at the front door is a dead giveaway to criminals that no one is home at your house. Make it a priority to have your home appear to have someone at home so that potential criminals will be deterred.  ","invest in a home security system. install window coverings for privacy. lock your doors and windows. install timers on your lights and tv. remove your name from your home’s exterior. let your neighbors know when you’ll be out of town.

"This will determine the candle making supplies you must purchase. Types of candles include:  Taper candles. These long, slender candles must be held upright in candle holders.  Pillar candles. These candles are broad enough to stand on their own, although they must be placed on a fire-safe plate for burning. They may have more than 1 wick and, although they are commonly cylindrical, they also come in a variety of other shapes, including square, oval and octagonal.  Poured candles. This type of candle may come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes, as the candle wax takes the shape of whatever container it is poured into. Be sure to use fire-safe containers when you make candles using this technique.  Votive candles. These short, cylindrical candles are dropped into clear, glass votive containers for burning.  Tea lights. Tea lights are similar in shape to votives, only they are shorter and sit in aluminum cups for burning.;  , The type of wax you use will be determined by the type of candle you choose to make. Remember that different types of wax have different melting points - the lower the melting point, the softer the wax - and that they may each react differently to additives. Therefore, you should always read the manufacturer's instructions before purchasing candle wax.  Paraffin wax comes in a variety of melting points, and can therefore be used for everything from poured candles (low melting point) to molded candles (high melting point). Paraffin does not have natural oils, so it does not hold scented oils as well as other oil-based waxes.  Beeswax is a natural wax that, as its name suggests, comes from bee hives. It has a sweet scent, is slow burning, has a high melting point, and can be relatively expensive.  Tallow is a wax that is derived from animal fats. It is colorless and has a low melting point, but it tends to emit smoke and an unpleasant odor when burning.  Bayberry wax is made by boiling leaves from the bayberry plant. This wax has a sweet, floral scent, is naturally a shade of green and has a very low melting point. Bayberry wax can be very expensive in comparison to the other types of candle making wax.  Soy wax is relatively inexpensive, burns cleanly, has natural oils that blend well with additives and comes in a wide range of melting points. Therefore, soy wax may be used for any type of candle.  Gel wax is clear and odorless, and has a very high melting point. It is generally used for theme candles with embedded objects, as gel candles are typically clear. Gel wax does not have natural oils, and therefore may not mix well with additives, which easily give the gel an opaque appearance.  The purpose of the wick is to draw fuel up from the candle and to the flame, and the type of wick you choose should be compatible with the type of candle you make, and the type of wax you choose.  Flat wicks are generally knitted or braided of 3 fibers. They burn consistently and are self-trimming, and are widely used for pillar and taper candles.  Square wicks are thicker than flat wicks, making them a good choice for use with additives, as the thicker wick helps prevent against wick clogging. Square wicks are self-trimming, and are generally used in pillar and taper candles.  Cored wicks are thick, braided wicks that have a metal core that makes them stand straight up, as opposed to the curling of flat and square wicks. The stiffness of cored wicks makes them a good choice for poured candles.  Wax coating. Wicks that have a wax coating work well with oil-based waxes, but you will want to use a wick that is not coated in wax if you are using candle gel, as the wax will cloud the gel.  The supplies you need will vary according to the types of candles you make, and a candle supplies list could include any number of the following:  Double boiler. Use a double boiler for melting your candle wax.  Thermometer. Your thermometer of choice should fit inside the double boiler. Use a high-quality thermometer, as it is very important to keep your melted wax at the appropriate temperature to prevent it from reaching its flash point and erupting into a fire.  Pouring pot. You will pour your melted wax from the double boiler into the pouring pot, and then use the pouring pot to pour your candles.  Candle wax.  Wick.  Additives. There are a number of things you can add to your candles for different aesthetic effects. Fragrances and dyes are the most common candle additives.  Containers. You will need to purchase containers if you plan on making poured candles. Depending on the type of candles you make, you may need to purchase votive holders, tea light cups, vases, bowls or any of a wide variety of containers that can be used for candle making. Remember that you may pour candles into any type of container that is fire-safe.  Compare prices before purchasing candle supplies. Explore these candle supply resources:  Chain retailers. Search the arts and crafts departments at your local retail department store.  Wholesalers. You can find many wholesalers of candle making supplies on the Internet. Wholesalers are a good option if you want to purchase your supplies in bulk. Just be prepared that you may need to provide a business license or business references in order to purchase wholesale.

"Compare prices on tableware and settings at local department stores. You can often find good deals on tableware and settings at discount stores, department stores, and dollar stores. If you do not have money to spend on tableware or settings, you could also ask to borrow a few things from a friend or family member.Try using disposable plates. You can save money and avoid the dishes.  Place a large bowl in the middle of your table. Before the meal or during appetizers, distribute small pieces of paper and some pens to guests. Ask guests to write a note about something they are thankful for in their life. Ask them if they are comfortable sharing their notes and, if so, to fold them and put them in the wishing well. During dessert, you can ask a volunteer to read a few of the notes aloud., The dollar store is one of the cheapest places to find holiday decorations. You can even purchase conventional products like glasses, candles, and buckets and then use them to make your own decorations. If you are really ahead of the game, you could buy your decorations the day after the holiday, when they are really cheap, and then use them the following year., Instead of going to the movies or to the shopping mall, you could go for a hike. Hiking is a free activity that has the additional benefit of ensuring everyone in the family gets some exercise on this busy and often stressful holiday. Look for hikes that are close to your family holiday location and include the family hike in your itinerary. The advantage of hiking over other physical activities is that it does not necessarily require specialized equipment, special skills or fitness levels. In other words, as long as one is able bodied, one can probably enjoy a short walk or hike in the woods.  If there are differently abled people in your group, you should look for a path that meets their mobility needs.  Specialized hiking equipment is available such as walking poles and hiking shoes, but this equipment is not necessary for a short, easy Thanksgiving day hike.

"The best way to look sad in person is to actually be sad. Sometimes you can accomplish this by focusing your mind on sad thoughts or memories. Try focusing on one or more the following:  The loss of a loved one and never having the chance to say goodbye.  Your own death and the limited time you have of life.  A tragic mistake from childhood that can’t be resolved or made up for.  Be warned that acting sad is a very good way to actually make yourself sad.Be careful pretending for too long.;  , Humans are social animals who accomplish a large part of their communication through facial cues and nonverbal means.Getting the major facial expressions down is a solid place to start when performing sadness. Try the following:  Frown and pout your lips. Both expressions are common displays of sadness.  Lower your gaze and turn your face away from the person you are talking with as though hiding or embarrassed.  Furrow your brow to show nervousness, consternation, frustration, or displeasure.  Look resigned or exasperated by raising your eyebrows and if in prolonged surprise. This communicates something like “I still can’t believe things are this bad.”  , Recent research suggests that looking sad has more to the do with overall body posture than facial expressions.Further research suggests that when reading emotions in other people, viewers will focus their attention on a person’s chest to read nonverbal cues.When you want to take your sadness act to the next level, incorporate full-body signs of depression and try the following:  Slump your shoulders and upper body downward to show the exhaustion and insecurity that come from sadness.  Turn your body away from the person you are talking to as though protecting yourself from further hurt.  Clutch your body or fold your arms in front of you to symbolize closing yourself off from the other person’s attempt to cheer you.  Touch your face to display a key gesture of sadness and self-comfort.  We all know that crying is a key sign of sadness and depression, and getting your face to look like you’ve spent the last few hours crying can go a long way convincing the person in front of you that you’re sad.  Rub your eyes hard to work up small tears and leave visible redness.  Why fake the tears when you can have them for real? There are a few good ways to actually cry on command that can amp up your sad game.  Sighing is a universal sign of sadness, and a well-timed sigh can trigger the other person to recognize and even respond to your sadness subconsciously., One of the most significant signs of sadness and depression is sleep deprivation.Beyond that, a lack of sleep is also one of the most easily recognized features of someone’s face.These facts make sleep deprivation a solid element to include in your act. Try the following:  Yawn silently. You are likely to yawn more loudly when waking up in the morning, but yawn more quietly when communicating a need for sleep.  Close your eyes and sigh as though just this one moment of rest is helpful.  Sad people will pull away from the world and take less interest in what is happening around them. You will look more sad in a face-to-face meeting if you come across distant and lost in your own mind.  Give the impression that you have lost interest in things you once enjoyed. For example, pretend you did not watch the latest sporting event and don’t care how it turned out.  Start to say something but then stop yourself as though communicating just isn’t important anymore.  Toy with things absent-mindedly, such as the edge of your sleeve, twigs or leaves, chipping paint, etc.  If you want to come across genuinely sad, you should give the impression that you want to stay sad. This means pulling away from other people and resisting their attempts to cheer you up.  Mention casually that you haven’t spoken to friends in a while and have been spending time alone.  Respond to invitations by saying “maybe” in a way that invites the person to infer you mean “no.”  Stop listening while the other person talks. Do this in order to show disinterest or interrupt them as though you weren’t really listening.  ","think sad thoughts in order to generate genuine feelings of sadness. take on a sad facial expression. convey sadness with your body language. show signs that you’ve been crying. sigh deeply. act as though you have been losing sleep lately. give signals of being troubled, distracted, or even a little absent-minded. appear socially detached by refusing to commit to future plans and avoiding upbeat social activities.

"Use the kind that can be found in costume stores and dollar shops what covers your face but has eye holes, mouth hole and nostril holes. This mask will keep the fabric away from your face, helping you to keep breathing and seeing okay.  Try the mask on for comfort. If it isn't comfortable, make any adjustments needed before gluing the fabric to it, as it's harder to do afterward.  Lycra, spandex, etc. are good choices but if you're not sure, check with the fabric retailer who might be able to offer some options once they understand what you're trying to do.  Attach the fabric to the mask by gluing it all the way around, overlapping the fabric edges to the back of the mask, going from the top of the mask down. A hot glue gun will make this easier but take care not to melt the plastic if it's a plastic mask.  As you glue, keep the fabric taut (stretched) so that it doesn't bunch up. Check that the fabric is smooth - wrinkles will spoil the end look.  Be sure to work around the elastic part that holds the mask to your head––it needs to be able to stretch normally still.  This is the piece that hides the back and sides of your head and joins to the front mask, completing the mask piece.  Place the mask down on a wider and higher piece of material.  Trace a wide oval or circle around the mask, leaving at least 4 inches/10cm space between the edges of the mask and the circle or oval circumference, with slightly longer for the portion that goes down your neck (the part that tucks into the shirt). The back piece fabric needs to be large to ensure a good fit. Use your own head size to guide the final measurements.  Overlap the top edge of the back piece (opposite end of the part you've designated as the neck end) to the back of the mask behind the forehead.  Continue gluing down the sides of the mask to the chin. This completes the back piece; the remaining unglued length at the base will tuck into the neck cover when assembling the mask.  This part isn't essential if you find that you can see through the fabric but test it to see. Only do this if you can't see through the fabric. If there is any risk of the fabric running once pierced, seal the circle edges with glue or sew around the border with invisible thread (a very fiddly job).  Cut a length of fabric from the stretchy white fabric that is wide enough to roll around your neck and cover the neck into the shirt collar. Glue this piece into a stretchy tube.  This piece covers the other two pieces for smoothing over the whole look.  For wearing, simply add the separate items as follows:  Put the face mask on first. Adjust for comfort.  Put the neck cover or dickey on next. Push it down to the neck zone and tuck the ends under the shirt.  Finish with the pantyhose leg. This should cover both the mask and the neck cover, to provide a smooth finish.  Go out and spook your fellow party goers.  ","purchase a blank white face mask. find some white fabric with good stretch to it. cut the fabric slightly wider and longer than the mask. make a back piece. glue the back piece to the mask. poke tiny holes into the eye area. make the neck cover (dickey or false shirt front). cut off one leg from a pair of white pantyhose. put it all together. done.

"Turn the oven on to 250 degrees F (120 C). Tear off parchment paper and line two baking sheets with the paper. Set them aside while you make the butternut squash chips.Ensure that one of your oven racks is in the middle of the oven. This will help the chips cook evenly.  Wash and peel one small butternut squash that's about one pound (455 g) in size. Use a large knife to carefully cut the squash in half so you end up with a thin end and a round end. Scoop the seeds out of the round end and throw them away. Use a mandoline to slice the squash into 1/8-inch thick (3 mm) slices.The slices from the thin end of the squash will be circular slices and the slices from the round end will actually be rings that you can fry.  Place the slices and rings of butternut squash into a large mixing bowl and drizzle them with 4 teaspoons of olive oil. Sprinkle the squash with 1/2 teaspoon of kosher salt and 2 teaspoons of chopped fresh herbs. Consider using:Sage  Thyme  Oregano  Rosemary  Parsley  , Lay the seasoned butternut squash on the parchment-lined baking sheets.

"If you are overweight, weight loss is one of the key lifestyle modifications you can make to decrease the stress on your arthritic joint, and hence to reduce the pain.  Note that if you are not currently overweight, this strategy does not apply to you. It only applies if you are currently above your ideal body weight.  Speak to your doctor or to a nutritionist about a healthy weight loss plan for you, and ask him what your ideal body weight should be.  It is important to lose weight in a way that does not compromise your nutrition (such as extreme dieting), and in a way that is sustainable for you in the long term.;  , Sports that put you at a higher risk of injury and that can lead to arthritis include ones with a lot of pounding such as running, as well as skiing, snowboarding, basketball, hockey, and football, among others.  For many people, giving up a sport they love in order to prevent further injury can be a challenging decision. Many people who injure themselves in athletics are very passionate about the sport they play.  It is important to consider not only your short-term satisfaction of playing the sport, but also your long-term quality of life, which may be compromised if you continue to put undue stress on your injured and arthritic joint.  Think about whether there are any other lower-impact sports or activities you enjoy. Perhaps you can try swimming, riding a bicycle, or water running, as all of these activities are excellent for your cardiovascular health and fitness and also low-impact for your joints.  If you have a physically demanding or strenuous job that stresses your injured joint, ask your boss if you can switch to alternative duties at work. Perhaps there is a desk job you can do, or another task that does not involve the same amount of physical stress and strain.  Consider getting a medical note from your doctor that explains to your boss the importance of not further stressing your injured and arthritic joint, particularly if the initial traumatic injury was sustained at work.  If you were injured on the job initially, look into the possibility of worker's compensation and/or employment insurance. You may receive coverage. If your injury is particularly severe, you may get disability pay without needing to return to work.  Strengthening the surrounding muscles can help to reduce the impact and the load on the joint itself.  The exercises prescribed to you by your physiotherapist will depend upon the nature of your injury, and which joint specifically is affected.  It is also recommended to consume more fish, which is rich in omega-3 fatty acids, and/or walnuts and flaxseed which also contain omega-3 fatty acids. Finally, consume plenty of organic fruits and vegetables; the antioxidants contained in these can help with post-traumatic arthritis.  These include evening primrose oil, omega-3 fatty acids, chondroitin, and glucosamine sulphate. Speak to your naturopath if you are interested in trying natural supplements as a means to treat your post-traumatic arthritis.  ","consider weight loss.post-traumatic arthritis is normally caused by an injury (often a sports injury, or an injury at work), and it is exacerbated (or made worse) by continual weight bearing and stress and strain on the joint. choose lower-impact sports and activities.particularly if the injury that first led to your arthritis was sports-related, you may want to consider avoiding this sport, or reducing our involvement in it, to prevent further injury to the same joint or to other joints. ask for modified duties at the workplace. see a physiotherapist.one way to reduce the pain in your joint from post-traumatic arthritis is to see a physiotherapist who can prescribe exercises for you to strengthen the muscles surrounding your injured joint. modify your diet.consuming more turmeric and ginger (both of which can be used as spices on your food) helps to combat inflammation and the pain from post-traumatic arthritis. consult a naturopath.there are a variety of supplements that have been shown to help with osteoarthritis (the type of arthritis that most often develops post-traumatically).

"Since you're adding this bow to a wreath, pick out ribbon that will contrast with the deep evergreen color of the foliage. Red, silver, and gold ribbon all work well for this purpose. Cut a length at least 12 inches (30.5 cm) long.  Hold the tail end of the ribbon against your palm, using your thumb to keep it in place. Wrap the ribbon around the back of your hand and bring it up over your palm. Keep doing this until the entire ribbon has been looped around your hand.

"Using make all the time isn't good for you skin. Use a little mascara on the upper lashes and a clear or pink lip gloss and maybe a little blush to highlight you face or liquid liner starting from the middle of your upper lash line and outwards.

It helps protect your lips from drying out and gets you closer to achieving those soft,pink lips.;  , Get rid of spots,acne,zits,and pimples for clean,pure skin.

Take a shower or bath every day,but don't get you hair wet unless you're going to properly shampoo and condition it. Always condition your hair after you shampoo so you can get the silky, glossy and good smelling hair you wanted. Use lotion if you have dry skin, and use sun screen if you want creamy white skin.Brush your teeth. If you have problems having a good smelling breath,mouth wash and a good smelling toothpaste will do the trick. If pearly whites is the problem,use a good whitening toothpaste and good toothbrush.Brush about 1-3 minutes every time.If you want to smell good, then try to layer fragrances. Start with a scented shower gel or bath oil. Move on to body lotion and finish with a light splash of perfume or body spray.  It will leave your skin glowing and your hair shining.

Not only will you feel great, but it give your body a chance to freshens itself and you will look better than the day before.Sweet treats, heavy meals, and sugary drinks before bed will keep you awake,so avoid this.If your tummy's rumbling,then have a cup of warm chamomile tea to help you relax.Try to relax before bed by listening to some gentle music.Make sure you have done your homework earlier,doing right before bed will keep you awake.Put a glass of water next to your bed just in case you wake up thirsty. Pull on some comfy pajamas, wash your face, brush your teeth, and hop on to bed. Read for a while until you are nice and sleepy,then turn out the lights.  Even ugly people look better when they smile nicely.  Now, just because you're trying to look better doesn't mean you going to go all phony. Be yourself, because the beauty inside is more important than the outside.  For some occasions, such as when you go to church, wear dressy stuff, like a dress with dressy but comfortable shoes, like wedges or ballet flats.For everyday wear, go for skinny (but not so skinny that you can't breathe) blue jeans and a cute t-shirt and cool and comfortable shoes,and every now and then, wear a skirt.  Necklaces, bracelets, rings, earrings, hair clips, the choice is endless! Maybe a necklace and earrings are fine for everyday wear. Oh, a hair clip or headband is fine, too. Remember to make the accessories match the second main color of your clothes. For an example, If you are wearing matching purple skirt and shirt with orange lining and details,then use orange accessories that are a little brighter than the clothes.Remember to keep it to a minimum, though, too much is more than enough!  , That doesn't mean you should be the slenderest girl on the block. Just eat well and exercise. If you're not very happy about working out, exercise does not mean work out. Do something. Dance, swim, run, or just simply play!  , Regularly shampoo and condition your hair for silky, shiny, luscious locks, but remember to rinse it thoroughly, or it will leave your hair dull and drab, and sometimes, left over shampoo or conditioner will cause an itch to your scalp!

Choose an app that you'd like to have in the same folder.  Drag and hold an app on the edge of the screen to move to another screen.  Grouping similar apps, like Photos and Camera, into folders is a good way to organize your iPhone's home screen.  Do so by tapping the ⓧ on the right side of the text field above the folder to clear it, then typing the label you prefer.  Your iPhone will suggest a label based on the apps it contains, such as 'Games' or 'Photography,' which you can simply leave in the field if you wish.  Do so by dragging them onto the folder.  The number of apps you can put in a folder varies by iOS version. iOS 10 allows 135 apps per folder.  You cannot nest folders inside folders.

"While it can be a blow to your pride, you should understand that you are responsible for the grade you have received. Conflicts with professors can happen, and external factors can affect your grade, but in most situations, you have to realize that if you want to improve, you have to act., Realize that bad things unfortunately happen in life. While getting a bad grade may put you in full panic mode, you have to put the situation into perspective in order to get to that Zen place. Do you have your health? Do you have a family who loves you and friends who rally around you? Count your blessings. Remember that while grades are important, they aren’t the only thing that should matter in your life.  When you are upset, it is all right to discuss it with a friend or family member. Do not feel as though you have to keep it to yourself. It is understandable if you are concerned about disappointing your parents, ruining your GPA, or making a bad impression on your professors. Know that you can pull through this and that you can find support.  You can even book an appointment with your college's mental health counselors (often known as the Campus and Psychological Services or CAPS). These are trusted professionals who are trained to help stressed out and upset college students.  Do not go on the internet and write your complaints online. These can be seen by other students, college officials, or possibly your professors. There can be many consequences from this. Talk in private to a friend or counselor.  While you may be stressed out, now is not the time to neglect your well-being. Get ice cream with a friend, watch a movie, or take a bubble bath. Do an activity that relaxes you. The goal is not to run away from the bad grade but to put yourself in a mental state where you can deal with it. Once you are relaxed, look back over your grade.  You are more than your grades. Good grades can give you great validation, but you should not let bad grades make you feel worthless. A bad grade does not mean you are stupid or that you are incapable of graduating college. Everybody has other great talents, qualities, and characteristics that can't be measured by a grade in school., When alone in your room, take a few minutes to close your eyes. Breathe in and out deeply, making sure to focus on your breath. Allow your thoughts to drift away. Think about nothing, and whenever your grade anxieties surface, push them away. You can try using soft music to help calm you. Try meditating for fifteen to thirty minutes.  Yoga is another great way to keep calm and achieve zen. Many campuses offer yoga classes. Check with your campus gym to see if you can sign up for a class.  Sometimes you don't have time to meditate when you feel anxious or panicked. You can use short relaxation techniques to soothe your mood. Stop what you are doing. Close your eyes, and count to ten. Visualize a calm and happy place, such as the ocean or a babbling brook. These techniques will help your body relax, and they will release any anxiety you have.You can tense your muscles and slowly release them during your count. Or you can squeeze a stress ball and slowly relax your grip.While visualizing your happy place, try to invoke all of your senses. If you are on the ocean, imagine the wind, the salty taste of the air, and the sand between your toes. This will make visualization more effective.  Remember to breathe deeply. Breathe in and out for every count up to ten.  Some people are so distressed about their grades that they start partying harder to forget about it, starting a vicious cycle. When you are stressed out about a bad grade, try to avoid drinking until you have calmed down.  ","take responsibility for the grade. put the situation into perspective. speak to a trusted confidante. give yourself a break. remind yourself that grades do not determine your self-worth. meditate. calm down during panic attacks using relaxation techniques. avoid drugs and alcohol.

"In any group environment, there are factors that encourage cohesion and indicate member status.A major indication of a weeaboo in your midst is the use of broken and incomplete Japanese in casual conversation, often in emphatic or overly dramatic ways. Using Japanese ungrammatically can be culturally insensitive, hinder communication, and create difficulty should you choose to learn the language in the future.Some expressions appropriated by the weeaboo community include:  Kawaii (かわいい)  English statement + desu (です)  Variation: English + Japanese adjective + desu (です). For example: 'I passed that exam so you know I'm kakkoii desu.'  Suffixes like -kun (－くん) and -chan (－ちゃん)  Baka (ばか)  Sugoi (すごい)  Chibi (ちび)  Ne! (ね);  , There are many positives to joining a group or subculture, but in-group bias isn't one.The automatic assumption that Japanese products are superior to others can be self isolatingand/or a mild form of delusion.Self-inquiry is a good way of diffusing weeaboo tendencies. If you can't identify the reason why something is better, chances are your preference is a matter of taste. Some questions to ask yourself:  Why do I like this Japanese product?  What is different between the Japanese product and a similar, non-Japanese product?  What makes the Japanese product better than a similar, non-Japanese product?  , Dress code and other social conventions telegraph group membership to others.There are socially appropriate places for you express your interest by wearing the same costume as your favorite character, like at an anime convention. Choosing daily clothing styled after anime characters is, in many cases, the hallmark of a weeaboo.  A single accessory or article of clothing from your costume can add flair to your daily outfit without appearing socially inaccessible to others.  You can meet new friends and boost your creative capacity through role-playing specific characters and fantastical scenarios,but don't let this come at the cost of your own development. Pretending to be something you are not, even if you are emulating something you admire, can lead to a mismatch between your outer self and inner feelings and cause potentially extreme consequences.Accept that your personality changes as a function of growth, as do preferences and beliefs. Even if you consider yourself a die-hard fan, respecting the potential for future change influences more moderate (and less weeaboo-like) behavior.  Occasionally put aside instant gratification, including anime, manga, costume making, and online activities. Reevaluate personal goals and your place in your community.Are you happy with where you're at? Ignoring these in favor of Japanese cultural pursuits is considered evidence of a weeaboo.  ","do not use weeaboo jargon. do not abnormally prioritize things that are japanese. do not alienate yourself through your choice in clothing. do not neglect your authentic self. "
"The first patrol you unlock is patrol the Cosmodrome which is on Earth. By doing patrol, you can pick up missions. This missions are set on beacons. To identify a beacon, they will flash green. In order to locate one, pull out your Ghost and it will navigate beacons in your area. To identify this one, when you pull out your Ghost, there will be a gray mark with numbers next to it. That is where you would want to head for a mission. The numbers indicate how far away you are from that specific beacon.;  , The campaign in Destiny is quite entertaining and enjoyable. But also a good way of leveling up. You can do a story mission more than once. However many times you want. The first story you unlock is A Guardian Rises on Earth. The second one you unlock is Restoration. You can do these missions over and over killing enemies for the XP. XP is what you are aiming for. Also remember that meleeing enemies gives you extra XP rather than shooting or throwing grenades at your target.  Upgrades on your weapons and gear give you a great amount of XP. They give a couple of XP, depending on how many upgrades you have of course. But not just that, you can also gain XP from upgrading subclasses.  Bounties are one of the greatest ways of actually leveling up.You can choose between two sections of bounties: Vanguard or Crucible, depending on what level you are to reach Crucible. But for starters, stick to Vanguard bounties. Bounties objectives you have to complete. All bounties come in different tasks. By completing these Vanguard bounties the don't just give you XP to level up. But also reputation towards your Vanguard. That is also great for leveling up too. You can get bounties from the bounty tracker.  Strikes are a better way of trying to level up than doing stories. Simply because strikes are much longer and have more effect. The first strike you unlock is the devils lair. Your target is the Sepiks Prime. There is always a boss to face in a strike, and you kill enemies along the way . Better and stronger enemies possibly. In the Devil Lair strike, at the beginning when you enter the terrestrial complex and go further on, then you will encounter great enemies to kill and will give you the XP you deserve. Remember, you can always do a strike more than once too. Just make sure you have at least three people on your fireteam; if not, then the game will search a fireteam available.  Crucible is competitive multiplayer in Destiny. Once you start getting settled and welled enough into the game then you should start getting used to doing Crucible. Crucible will earn you XP and even weapons and gear. Crucible can be very effective to your Guardian.  This is when a mission at random is selected and chosen as the daily heroic mission. The mission will apparently have the heroic modifier activated. When the heroic modifier is active, enemies will appear in greater numbers and are more aggressive according to Bungie.

"There are several possibilities here:  Try designer clothing consignment stores. These stores carry designer fashions that the owner no longer wants to wear but would like to get a little bit of money for. The owner of the store takes some of the sales price and the seller gets the rest. You, the buyer, often get a real bargain. Many times the clothing in these stores has been barely worn. Be prepared for last season's fashion sometimes but if the clothing is designer, it should withstand radical fashion changes and will be well tailored, well fitting and of good quality fabric.  Shop at thrift stores in wealthy areas. You will have to rummage a fair amount, so be prepared for some hard work but amazing bargains can be uncovered.  Try market stalls. Some market sellers specialize in selling used designer wear. You can search in local phone directories or on the Internet.;  , For lower level designers, these stores are around in most major cities. For more high-end, expensive designer wear, the outlet stores are fewer except in fashion mecca cities, such as Montreal. If you are near them, you will score some amazing bargains that didn't get sold for one reason or another to the stores and designers that were meant to take them. These are usually advertised in newspapers and by way of flyers or wall posters.  Again, this works only in cities that specialize in making the clothing but they will often have some streets lined with boutiques that are so competitive, their designer label prices are kept much lower than in other parts of the world.  Try eBay and other online auction sites. Sellers do the walking, rummaging and stocking for you. All you need to do is sit there with your mouse hovering over the clothes that interest you. Ask questions if the photos are unclear or there isn't enough information supplied.  Get your friends together and ask them to bring at least one piece each of designer gear they no longer want and start swapping. Don't forget to include jewelry, scarves and hats as part of the swap party.  ","shop at used clothing stores. wait for factory outlet sales. visit rag trade districts. shop online. have a fashion swap party. "
"Know how your team will function without this employee. Think about that job's responsibilities and be ready to assign them to someone else, or hire a more suitable employee.  If you chose to hire another employee as a replacement, be careful about your recruiting efforts. If you’re dissatisfied with your employee, it's possible they are dissatisfied with the job themselves, and are looking for similar employment elsewhere. If they come across their job description for your company, and know that you are planning to fire them, they could take offense and take retaliatory measures—anything from sabotaging clients to stealing company secrets.  If the circumstances around the termination could be contested, offering several weeks or months pay in exchange for signing a severance agreement can be a good way to protect your organization from a damaging legal battle. It can also be a compassionate way to help an employee make it through what is sure to be a trying time.  You want to place where both you and the employee are comfortable speaking plainly. There may be issues that did not come out beforehand about other employees, or pay information—things that are not and should not be shared indiscriminately.

"You don’t have get rid of tortilla chips completely on a low cholesterol diet. Choose healthy multigrain chips or natural chips with few ingredients. Look for chips that only contain corn, oil, and salt. Many tortilla chips have no cholesterol, so read the label.  Corn does not contain cholesterol, so any cholesterol in a chip comes from the fat used to fry the chip (often lard). Check the ingredients to find out what the chip was fried in — avocado oil, canola oil, flaxseed oil, olive oil, peanut oil are all oils that can actually help lower your cholesterol.  Instead of eating tortilla chips with cheese sauces, try fresh salsa, pico, or guacamole.;  , Many Mexican dishes contain high amounts of cheese, which can be full of cholesterol. When making Mexican food at home, leave out the cheese completely. Instead, top with fresh veggies.If you need some cheese, sprinkle a small amount of reduced-fat cheese on top of the dish.  Cheese and full-fat sour cream are not the only toppings for a Mexican dish. So many fresh, cholesterol-free ingredients can be added to the top of tacos, fajitas, and taco salads. Try salsa, pico de gallo, cilantro, tomatoes, and jalapeños.Think outside of the box and add any veggie you like. Try black olives, cucumbers, carrots, bell peppers, onions, broccoli, spinach, roasted eggplant, roasted zucchini and squash, or anything else you enjoy.  Beans without any added fat can be a tasty and a great addition to a Mexican dish. Cook dried black or pinto beans and add them to salads, tacos, or burritos. Beans can be a healthy source of fiber and protein. Beans can also help lower your cholesterol.Try making healthy refried beans by mashing beans and adding seasoning. Just make sure you skip the oils.  To add flavor to your Mexican food, experiment with spices. Mexican food is known for its spices and rich flavors. Try jalapeños or habanero peppers if you like spicy foods. Try other spices, like cumin, chili powder, coriander, or garlic.Other spices common to Mexican dishes include oregano, cloves, cinnamon, and allspice.  If just salsa isn’t enough for you, try getting your creamy texture and taste from guacamole instead of sour cream. Guacamole contains avocado, tomatoes, and spices, which can add a boost of flavor to your dish without added cholesterol.Try slicing up some avocado and put it into all of your dishes.  Corn tortillas are much healthier than flour tortillas. Corn tortillas generally have lower fat and cholesterol contents, along with fewer added ingredients. Flour tortillas generally have more calories and fat, and they contain many more ingredients.Read the labels. Many flour tortillas have long lists of ingredients, which include hydrogenated oils, sugar, and other additives. Corn tortillas have fewer ingredients, with some having only corn and water.  You may also try whole wheat tortillas, but make sure to read the labels. While spinach, whole grain, tomato, or whole wheat tortillas may appear healthy, they may be full of hydrogenated  oils and unhealthy additives.  Hard or soft shells don't matter as long as you read the ingredients to make sure you get shells with minimal and healthy ingredients.  Consider making your own homemade tortillas. This way you can control what you put into them.  ","choose healthy tortilla chips. limit the amount of cheese. choose low-cholesterol toppings. eat beans. use spicy elements. replace sour cream with guacamole. choose corn tortillas. "
"It takes something significant to break a femur bone in an otherwise healthy individual.

It would not be uncommon for the patient to be unconscious, either from lateral injuries or from passing out in sheer pain.  Airway. The patient must have an open airway or all else is a moot point.

"Xcode is the development environment that all iPhone apps are created in. Xcode is available for free from Apple, but requires OS X 10.8 or later to be installed. There is no official way to run Xcode on a Windows or Linux PC. This means that if you want to develop an iPhone app but don't have a Mac, you'll need to invest in one first.  To develop iOS 8 apps, you will need Xcode 6.0.1 and the iOS 8 SDK, both of which are available from Apple. The iOS 8 SDK contains a significant number of new APIs that allow you to create all kinds of new app experiences, including iCloud integration and Touch ID.  To develop iOS 10 apps, you'll need Xcode 8 and the iOS 10 SDK, also available from Apple. There are significant changes to the Swift language and the SDK in this version of Xcode that you'll want to be aware of, but the good news is that there are to be no more 'code breaking' changes to the Swift language after this version.;  , While you can code completely within Xcode, you'll find that working with large chunks of code is much easier if you have a dedicated text editor that specializes in programming syntax. TextMate and JEdit are two very popular choices.  If you plan on creating custom art and designs for your app, you will want a program that can create vector graphics. Vector graphics scale without losing clarity, and are essential for a good-looking app. Popular vector programs include CorelDraw, Adobe Illustrator, Xara Designer and Inkscape. A nice, free, vector graphics drawing program is DrawBerry. It is not as powerful as the professional programs, but it is good for a first-time user, or if you just don't want to pay for something just for one use.  It handles data and object manipulation. Objective-C is a derivative of the C family of languages, and is an object-oriented language. If you already have a basic understanding of C or Java, Objective-C should be, for the most part, pretty easy to grasp.  A newer option is to create your app using the Swift language, the follow-on to Objective-C. Swift has a much friendlier syntax and a more modern feel.  While it's possible to build a basic app without knowing Objective-C, you cannot perform any sort of advanced function without coding it yourself. Without Objective-C, all you can do is move back and forth between screens.  There are a variety of tutorials available online, as well as a wealth of information to be found in various books about Objective-C or Swift. If iPhone app development is something you want to take seriously, you'll be well-served by having some resources handy.  Some of the more popular online Objective-C and Swift communities include the Apple Developer Forums, the iPhoneSDK Google Group, and StackOverflow.  If you simply don't have any interest in learning Objective-C or Swift or don't have an artistic bone in your body, there are a large number of freelancers and development teams out there that may be able to take on various aspects of your project for you. Outsourcing your development is a complicated process, but can save you lots of headaches if you're not the programming type. Make sure that everyone involved signs a Non-Disclosure Agreement, and that pay structures are in place before any work begins.ODesk and Elance are two of the most popular freelancing services on the Internet, and both have hundreds of developers and artists of all skill levels.  In order to distribute your app on the App Store or give it to others to test, you will need to sign up for an Apple Developer account. The account costs $99 per year and will require you to enter in tax and bank account information.  You can create your account at the iOS Dev Center website.  Once you've signed up for a Developer account, you will have access to Apple's development resources. These resources include a variety of sample projects which can give you a tremendous amount of insight into how app development works. Find an example that is related to the kind of app you want to create and mess around with it in Xcode.  Before you even open Xcode for the first time, you should have a well-thought-out plan for your app and its features. This could include a design document which outlines all of the functionality of the app, sketches of the user interface and flow between screens, and a basic idea of the types of systems that will need to be implemented.  Try to stick to your design document as much as possible while you are developing your app. This will help keep you focused on the features you want.  Try to draw at least one thumbnail sketch for each screen in your app.  The audience of your app will have a lot to do with the way it looks and the functionality of the application. For example, a to-do list app will have a much different audience than a gory shooting game. This will help you  , If your app is a utility of some kind, it should offer a solution to a problem that hasn't been solved before or a unique solution or method or one that does it better than previous attempts. If your app is a game, it should have a unique feature or features that help set it apart and attract specific gamers.  Your user interface will be determined by the type of content you are showing the user of your app. For example, if the app deals with photos, you will want a user interface that makes looking at photos and navigating through them as easy as possible.  The user interface should never get in the way of the user. This means that options should be clearly visible, and the user should never have to question what button does what. If you are using icons, they should accurately represent their function. Navigation through the app should be fluid and natural.  UI design is as much an art form as it is a science. You will likely be revising your design constantly as your project evolves.  Open up Xcode, and start a new Project from the File menu. Select 'Application' under the 'iOS' heading on the left side of the window. In the template section, choose 'Empty Application'.  There are a variety of templates available, all designed for different tasks. Start with a blank template until you get more comfortable with the development process. You can try one of the more complicated templates once you're familiar with how everything works.  You will need to provide a Product Name, your company identifier, and the class prefix. If you don't have a company identifier from Apple yet, enter com.example. For the class prefix, enter XYZ.  Select 'iPhone' from the Devices menu.  The Storyboard is the visual representation of all of your app's screens. It shows the contents of each screen as well as the transitions between them. The Storyboard tool will help you develop the flow of your app.  Click File → New → File.  Under the iOS heading, click 'User Interface'.  Select Storyboard, and click Next.  Select iPhone from the Devices menu, and then name the file 'Main'. Make sure that it is saved in the same location as your project.  Once you create the Storyboard, you will need to assign it as the main interface of your app. This will load the Storyboard when the app is launched. If you don't assign the storyboard, nothing will happen when you start the app up.  Click your project name in the left navigation tree.  Find the Targets heading in the main frame. Select your project from the Targets list.  Find the Deployment Info section in the General tab.  Enter Main.storyboard into the 'Main Interface' text field.  View controllers dictate how content is viewed by the user. There are a variety of preset view controllers available, including standard views and tables. You will add view controllers to your storyboard, which tells the app how to display the content to the user.  Select your 'Main.storyboard' file in the project navigation menu. You will see a blank canvas appear in the Interface Builder window.  Find the Object Library. This is located at the bottom of the right frame, and can be selected by clicking the little cube button. This will load a list of objects that can be added to your canvas.  Click and drag the 'View Controller' object onto the canvas. Your first screen will appear on the canvas.  Your first 'Scene' is complete. When the app is started, the view controller will load your first screen.  Once you have the view controller set, you can start populating the screen with the interface objects you need, such as labels, text input fields, and buttons. Interface objects can all be found in the Objects Library list that you found the View Controller object in.  Click and drag objects from the list to add them to your screen.  Most objects can be resized by clicking and dragging the boxes on the edge of the object. When resizing, guidelines will appear on the screen so that you can ensure everything lines up correctly.  You can adjust the properties for each object, allowing you to create a custom and intuitive interface. For example, you can add placeholder text to a text input field that will help guide the user on what they should input.  Select the object you want to customize and click the 'Attributes Inspector' button at the top of the right frame. The button looks kind of like a shield.  Customize the object to your liking. You can change font style, font size, text color, alignment, background images, placeholder text, border style, and much more.  The available options will change depending on the object you are customizing.  As your project grows, you will probably need to add more screen to display all the content necessary for the app to be useful. For example, if you are making a to-do list app, you will need at least two screens: one for inputting a to-do list item, and one for viewing the entire list.  More screens are added by dragging and dropping view controller objects onto blanks parts of your canvas. If you can't find a blank spot to drop it, click the 'zoom out' button until you find empty areas. Make sure to drop the view controller onto the canvas and not onto an existing screen.  You can change the initial screen by selecting the view controller you want to lead with from the project outline. Click the Attribute Inspector button and check the 'Is Initial View Controller' box. For example, if you are making a to-do list, you'll want the actual list to be the first thing the user sees when the app is launched.  Now that you have two screens in your app, it's time to make it so that the user can move back and forth between them. You can do this through the use of a Navigation Controller, which is a specialized View Controller. This controller adds a navigation bar to the top of your app that allows user to move back and forth between screens.Your navigation controller should be added to your initial view so that it can control all subsequent screens.  Select your initial view in the project outline.  Click Editor → Embed In → Navigation Controller.  You should see a gray navigation bar appear at the top of the screen you added the controller to.  Now that you have inserted the navigation bar, you can start adding navigation tools to it. This will allow your user to move back and forth between screens.  Add a title to the navigation bar. Click the Navigation Item underneath the view controller you assigned it to. Open the Attribute Inspector and type the title of the current screen in the Title field.  Add a navigation button. Open the Objects library if its not already open and find the Bar Button Item. Click and drag it to the navigation bar. Typically, buttons that move you 'forward' in the app are placed to the right, and buttons that move you 'back' are placed to the left.  Give the button a property. Buttons can be configured to have specific properties that make them easy to adapt to the circumstance. For example, if you are creating a to-do list, you'll want an 'Add' button to create a new entry. Select the button, and open the Attribute Inspector. Find the Identifier menu and choose 'Add'. The button will change to a '+' logo.  In order for your button to function, you will need to connect it to another screen. In our to-do list example, the button is located on the overall list, and needs to be linked to the entry screen. To link the button, hold the Ctrl and drag the button onto the second screen.When you release the mouse button, the Action Segue menu will appear with a list of options. Choose 'Push' to use the push transition when moving between screens. You can also choose 'Modal', which will open the screen as a self-contained action as opposed to a sequence.  If you use Push, a navigation bar will be added automatically to your second screen and a 'back' button will be automatically created. If you choose modal, you will need to manually insert a second navigation bar as well as add a 'Cancel' and 'Done' button (for a to-do list; the labels of your buttons will change depending on the needs of your app).  'Cancel' and 'Done' buttons can be created the same way that you created the 'Add' button. Simply select 'Cancel' or 'Done' from the Identifier menu in the Attribute Inspector.  Up to this point, you've been able to create a basic navigable interface without the need for any coding. If you want to add any deeper functionality, such as data storage and handling user input, you'll need to get your hands dirty in the code. Coding is outside of the scope of this guide, but there are a large number of Objective-C tutorials available online.You can use your navigable interface prototype to help you hire a developer. Having a working interface will make it much easier to explain what you need on the coding side of things.  Xcode comes with a built-in iOS simulator that lets you test your app on a variety of simulated iOS devices. To start the Simulator, choose 'Simulator and Debug' from the dropdown menu at the top of the Xcode window, and then choose the device you want to test on.  Click the Build button, which looks like a traditional Play button, to compile the app and run it. Building the app may take a few minutes. you can watch the progress in the toolbar. Once the build process is complete, the iOS Simulator will open and you can begin testing your app.  Before distributing your app for testing, you can test it on your own device (if you have one). First, plug your device into your computer via USB. Close iTunes if it opens. Select 'Device and Debug' from the dropdown menu, and then click the Build button. After a few seconds the app should launch on the iPhone. test all of the functionality before closing the app.  If your app crashed, you need to start figuring out what happened and why. This is a vast subject and there are countless reasons why your app may have crashed. Open the debug console and read the error messages. Most of the time they are rather cryptic. If you do not understand the error, try Googling the error message. Chances are, you will find a post on the Apple development forum where a friendly seasoned developer has answered their plea.  Debugging can be a very time consuming and tedious time for you. If you don't give up and persevere, in time you will get better at it. You will start to recognize the errors, track them down quickly, and even expect them on occasions. One common mistake is releasing an object from memory more than once. Another is forgetting to allocate memory and initialize an object before trying to add or assign to it. With each app your errors will become fewer and fewer.  The iPhone has a very limited amount of memory. Each time you allocate an object some memory, you have to release it when you are done with it and give back the memory. Instruments is the iPhone SDK tool for viewing and analyzing your memory usage amongst other things.  With Device and Debug selected as before, choose Run → Run with Performance Tool → Leaks. This will launch Instruments and start the app on your device. Go ahead and use the app as normal. It will seem to freeze periodically as Instruments records and analyzes your memory usage. Any leaks will result in a red spike in the Leaks timeline. The source of the leaks will be displayed in the lower half of the screen.  Double clicking on the leaked objects will attempt to take you to the responsible code or clicking on the little arrow in the address column will show you the leak history. Sometimes where the leak is detected is not necessarily where it originated from.  If you get really stumped, try by process of elimination. Comment out and/or carefully bypass areas of your code and run it. Sometimes you can narrow down the general area and then eventually home in on the responsible line. When you know where it is, you can fix or rewrite it. Remember, using Google can often provide you with the quickest direct links to internal Apple forums or documentation that deal with your issue.  While testing your app in a simulated setting is a good way to ensure that your app works and that the interface looks good, nothing beats testing from users other than yourself. Just make sure you've ironed out the most egregious bugs before sending it out for external testing. In order to distribute your app to your testers, you will need to create an Ad-Hoc certificate on the iOS Dev Center site.  External testers can provide a lot of feedback that you wouldn't expect. This can be especially useful if you have a complex app.  In order to authorize tester's devices, you will need each device's UDID number.  Choose Device from the drop down list and press the 'Build' icon. In the Finder, navigate to your project's folder and look for the 'Ad-Hoc-iphoneos' folder. Inside there will be an app. Copy your 'AdHoc.mobileprovision' certificate you got from the iOS Dev Center into the same folder. Select the app and the certificate and zip them up. This archive can be given to your external tester. You will need to create a separate archive for each Ad-Hoc certificate., Select Device and Release from the drop-down menu. Press the 'Build' icon. In the Finder, navigate to your project's build folder and look for the 'Release-iphoneos' folder. Inside there will be an app. Zip it up into an archive.  In order for new apps to pass Apple certification, they will need to be optimized for iOS 8 and the Retina display.  You can access this from the iOS Dev Center. If you have any unfinished steps to complete for setup, they will be listed at the top of the page. Make sure that all of your banking and tax information has been entered correctly.  Click 'Manage Your Applications' and then select 'Add new Application'. Fill out the App name, SKU number and select the bundle ID. Select your app bundle from the drop down menu.  Fill out the forms providing your app description, keywords, support site, category, contact email, copyright etc.  Fill out the Rights and Pricing forms.  Have your iTunes artwork ready. You will need a large 512x512 vector icon, as well as some screenshots of your app. Screenshots can be grabbed from the iPhone simulator using Command + Shift + 4 and dragging the cross-hair over the area. Make sure they are 320x480 for iPhone. Screenshots are a very important part of marketing your app, so make sure that they show the most important parts.  Click 'Ready to Upload Binary' and you will be taken to a screen that directs you to download the Application Uploader tool. Download it and press Done.  Install the Application Uploader tool and launch it. The first time you run the program, it will ask for your iTunes login information.  The Application Uploader tool will check your iTunes Connect account and find any apps you are ready to upload binaries for. They will be displayed in the drop-down menu. Select the one you want, choose the Distribution zip you created earlier and upload it. The uploader will check some internal stuff within the bundle and will return an error if it finds anything incorrect, such as an incorrect version number, missing icon etc. If everything is fine, it will upload the zip and finish.  There is nothing to do now except wait for the review process. Apple will notify you in a few days or weeks via email if your application state changes to 'In review'. When it goes into review, the process is very quick. If it fails the initial barrage of tests, you will get a rejection email telling you why, and Apple will offer suggestions for fixing it. If your app passes inspection, Apple will send you an email informing you that your app is ready for sale. Your app will now appear on the iTunes app store  , Now that your brand-new app is available for purchase, it's time to start spreading the word. Utilize social media, send out press releases to App-focused sites, make some YouTube videos, and do everything you can to get people talking about your app.  You can send free copies to reviewers, who will then write about your app on their website or review it on their YouTube channel. If you are able to get it in the hands of popular reviewers, this can lead to a lot of sales.  Download the free iTunes Connect Mobile app for your iPhone. Login each day and check your sales, markets, and countries of sale. This is the fun part! Apple will periodically send you emails with links to your latest sales data. You can download them for your records. Good luck!

"This means relinquish the inner resistance you have been offering to the undesirable circumstances, thoughts and other stimuli. Say an 'inner' yes to the present, doesn't matter what you say or do externally but there should be an 'inner Yes' or an inner alignment to what is. What does it mean to say 'inner Yes'?  It means say 'yes' to the thoughts and emotions that arise in your consciousness by allowing, accepting or giving them full attention, etc. However, you don't have to follow them. As thoughts create a lot of problems too. When there is an inner acceptance then you have a choice to follow a thought or refuse to follow it, externally. In the same way you would have a choice to follow circumstances or people or refuse to follow them. There will be time when you would have to say 'No', externally, but that would be a deeper 'No'. Not from ego but from deep within you. Do experiments to learn, like refuse to follow some thoughts and then see the result. However there should always be an inner yes, an inner acceptance.  Give your full and unconditional attention to anything you are doing. Like brushing your teeth, cooking, washing your hands, walking etc. Most people are lost in thoughts while doing these chores, but these simple chores can be great opportunities to practice surrender.'Everybody's life really consists of small things. Greatness is a mental abstraction and a favorite fantasy of the ego. The paradox is that the foundation for greatness is honoring the small things of the present moment instead of pursuing the idea of greatness' (Eckhart Tolle).  On a Universal level, 'Giving' is the same as 'Receiving'. The more you give, the more you will receive. If you feel like you are lacking something in life then ask yourself, 'What can I give in this situation?' Try this for a couple of weeks and see how it changes your reality: Whatever you think people are withholding from you- praise, appreciation, assistance, loving care, and so on – give it to them. You don't have it?Just act as if you had it, and it will come. Then, soon after you start giving, you will start receiving. You cannot receive what you don't give. Outflow determines inflow. Whatever you think the world is withholding from you, you already have, but unless you allow it to flow out, you won't even know that you have it. This includes abundance.  Be aware of your breath, inner body or sense perceptions, as much as you can. Our inner body is a bridge between form and formless(Universal intelligence). So keeping some attention with in while doing anything, not only keeps you connected to present moment, but also make your actions high quality.Read Stay Rooted in Being for more depth.  If you are aware enough you would have noticed physical reactions to your thoughts in body and vice versa.Like tautness in face or brain muscles and muscles around your heart in response to a thought.  Similarly, have you noticed emotional reactions to your fearful thoughts in body? like anxiety, fear, anger etc?  If you could single out the moment, you will observe that physical pain and emotions are simply intense pressure or uneasiness or energy you feel somewhere in the body. For the most part, that doesn't make you unhappy. Its the reactive thoughts in response to these that make you unhappy.  As mentioned before - feel this pain or negative emotions and don't let it rise up and turn into thinking.Instead go deeper into them and feel them fully.  Mental labeling happens automatically on the basis of conditioning your mind had. Have you noticed when you see some person or experience something, there is a small pause and then mind kicks in with the automatic mental labeling?Try it now: Look away from the screen and watch your inner self with high alertness. Did you notice a pause of no thought and then the 'heavy mind machinery' started, causing a taut feeling in your body and brain muscles? Did it feel as if resisting or judging what is?  Many people are not even aware of this automatic mental labeling or painful impulse because of the mental noise or because they consider it 'normal'.  Similarly, we automatically judge or label people or a group of people. This is the biggest reason why it becomes easier to vilify people, because we have already vilified them in our mind by labeling or conceptualizing them. 'To reduce the aliveness of another human being to a concept is already a form of violence' (Eckhart Tolle).  'She didn't have the decency to return my call', 'He gave me a bad review, I could lose my job', 'the soup is so damn cold, I am never coming to this place again', 'I have been feeling fatigued for a while now, do I have cancer?'.  How simple life would be without these mental stories. 'She did not call', 'He gave me a poor review', 'the soup is cold', 'There's a tautness in my body'.'There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so.' William Shakespeare.  When you notice yourself being taken over by mind or any egoic pattern, then smile, laugh and have fun with it.. For example make fun of yourself like 'I am in nut-mode','I have been possessed by ego' etc. Or replace mental noise with constructive content or actions. Its like channeling the reactions(negative energy) in a creative and constructive way to transmute them. It is highly recommended to read Stay Rooted in Beingfor more depth.  Thoughts and emotions is energy that arises in your consciousness. Since energy can only be transmuted, so practices like verbalizing, inner body awareness, breath meditation, etc. help transmute negative low frequency emotions to high frequency. Another reason why resistance is futile. Read Stay Rooted in Being for pragmatic practices.  Allow, remain non-reactive and smile, even if it makes you do or say things you don't want to say or do. Learn from the past but don't feel guilty about it because then it becomes psychological pain.  Most of us don't know who we truly are. Trapped in this dream of life, seeing reality through limited view of sense perceptions and ruled by thoughts; without even knowing it's not us.That's the reality of the majority of people, i.e completely identified with mind and form. They are not even there. Feeling uncertain or thinking it's nonsense?  , Have you ever noticed that before you start running or any other challenging task, mind activity is high? For example thoughts like 'this is going to be tough', 'I don't wanna run', 'this is a mistake' etc, will start arising in your space of consciousness. However, when you push through that initial static of thoughts and emotions by running for some time, then the thoughts from in the beginning change or disappear. If you had believed your mind in the first place, would you have run? The initial thoughts we get are what we are conditioned to think. This is why instead of fighting the conditioned thoughts, which on the contrary makes them stronger, channel reactive energy of thoughts to something constructive like replacing these thoughts with present moment anchors, making it fun and silly, constructive action, thoughts or content etc. As that's what reconditions your mind. Read Stay Rooted in Being and Become Mentally Flexible for more depth.  One of the reasons for high thought activity is because of the unreleased surplus energy in us. Cause mind acts out this surplus energy via thoughts. So some form of thorough physical workout helps a lot to release this surplus energy as physical exertion drastically reduces mind activity and forces it to surrender. So try different experiments and activities to force your mind to surrender.  The time is always now.Feeling regret or guilty about something you did or didn't do, enter now from there.  Feeling sad because of some loss, enter now from there.  Feeling resentment, enter now from there.  Too excited or anxious, enter now from there.  Feeling unforgivable or self pity, enter now from there.Again, even if you are going through a bad situation or stuck in past or future etc., what's stopping you to become present now? You have power only in the now. Suppose you forgot to be aware of your breath or inner body, can you become aware of it now? Instead of feeling guilty about it. Just forgive yourself and enter now from there.  Your mind might ask questions like 'So how can I allow thoughts and emotions?','What does it mean to watch your inner-self?', 'What's 'enter now from there'?' etc and come up with mental answers to the questions on the basis of its conditioning. For example your mental answer could be: 'Watching means to just be silent and observe'(another concept). This might trigger another question 'So how can I observe?' and this might lead to another mental interpretation, until mind conceptualizes it with a notion that it will free you of the ego. Which is short sighted and doesn't work.  It's ok to have these concepts in the beginning(or use them from time to time) but realize that the words and concepts are no more than stepping stones to be left as quickly as possible.Finger (concept or thoughts) pointing to the moon (consciousness) is not the moon.  You know who you are? You are the awareness(subject) that sees these thoughts, concepts and reactive thoughts (voice in head or objects)that uses the words like 'I' or 'you' and pretends to be you.  “I am a hole in a flute that the Christ's breath moves through.....listen to this music”- hafiz  ","practice inner acceptance. start with little things. give. stay rooted in being. recognize the interconnection between mind, emotions and body. experiment. see the suchness of this moment. smile and laugh at it. when you are stillness, what can you resist?, force your mind to surrender. enter 'now' from there. free yourself from all concepts.

"Azaleas are popularly grown in the Southeastern US, since they do well with mild winters and long summers. Azaleas are hardy plants that don't need much in the way of accommodations. Different types of azaleas have slightly different needs, so pay attention to what type you pick out to ensure you'll be satisfied with the results.  Azaleas are available in two main classes: native azaleas, which grow like vines and don't need pruning, and Asian azaleas, which grow as shrubs.  Asian azaleas are available in two varieties, both of which are evergreen:  Kurume hybrids. These are bright red and keep well-contained in one area. They can be planted in containers, raised beds or directly in the ground, and won't get larger than 3 or 4 feet (0.9 or 1.2 m) tall. They don't require much maintenance.  Southern Indian hybrids, on the other hand, grow very tall and large. They come in many colors, notably hot pink and white, and can easily grow tall enough to cover a window or door. If you have a lot of space, this might be a good choice for you, but you'll have to prune from time to time.  The Azalea Society or your local nursery can make recommendations on the type of azalea to plant in your area. There are hybrid descriptions and examples online or in local garden and landscaping shops. Stick with one type of azalea, or incorporate several different colors and species into the garden for variety.;  , Find a place in the garden or yard with some shade - 'dappled shade,' as many azalea enthusiasts term it. This particular mix of shade and sunlight is perfect for azaleas. If you plant them in full sunlight, they won't grow as well. According to the Azalea Society of America, azaleas bloom well when planted under shady trees.  There are deciduous azalea varieties that do well with full sun, so check into these if you don't have much shade available.  Azaleas need soil that drains very well, rather than retaining water after a rain. To determine whether the soil drains well where you want to plant your azalea, dig a hole before it rains, then check back afterward. If the hole is filled with standing water, the soil doesn't drain well; it's likely highly composed of clay. If the water is gone, the soil should be fine for azaleas.  If the soil doesn't drain well, you can mix it with compost or other organic matter in order to loosen it up. Till it to a depth of several feet to break it up, then mix in the other well-draining matter. Another option is to plant your azalea in a pot or a raised bed, where you can control the soil drainage more easily., Azaleas prefer a slightly acidic soil, such as a pH 5.5 or pH 6. If a soil test reveals an alkaline soil, mix some sulfur into the dirt before planting to balance it.  Use a garden shovel to dig a hole in the dirt deep enough to cover the root and bottom of the plant. Dig a few inches wider than the ball of the root, and set the azalea upright in the hole so that the top of the root ball is slightly above the surface of the ground. Drop soil into the hole around the plant. Spread it around and under the azalea, and lightly pat it into place with your fingertips.  Wet the azalea before planting. Dip the root ball in a bucket of water, or use a hose to lightly dampen it, before setting the azalea into the ground.If you are planting more than one azalea, make sure the holes are space several feet apart.  Water the plant and the soil slowly and thoroughly. Water again the day after planting. The plants must be watered at least once per week, unless they are in direct sunlight, in which case they must be watered more frequently. Take care not to let the azalea dry out, or it will wither.  Use pine bark, pine needles, sawdust or wood chips between the bushes. This will keep the soil moist and the temperature of the dirt even. Mulch will also help keep out weeds.  If your soil is rich and acid, you won't need to fertilize often. If you do choose to fertilize, do it in spring, right after the azalea blooms. Use an acid forming fertilizer like cottonseed meal, or choose a special azalea fertilizer.  Improper fertilizing can cause the plant to bloom at the wrong time, so be sure to fertilize only if required.  Pruning azalea plants early will allow the plant's energy to be directed toward producing new growth. Assess your azalea to find dead branches and other spots that need trimming. Use a pair of hand clippers to thin the azaleas. Clip out any dead branches.  Don't go overboard with this early-season pruning. Each healthy branch you cut away is a branch that could have produced beautiful spring flowers. If you want to drastically change the shape of your azalea, wait until later in the summer.  Now is the time to reshape your azalea shrub if you wish. Cut long, stray shoots next to woody branches to retain the azalea's natural form. Trim back areas that seem too crowded to promote air flow and improve the look of the bush. Be sure you make careful cuts - don't use hedge clippers to trim the bush willy nilly.  Don't prune too late in the year. Prune no later than 3 weeks after the blooms have gone - otherwise, you'll be cutting away next year's flower growth.  If you have an azalea that has grown to large proportions and you're ready to cut it back, you can safely cut it to within a foot of the ground and it will grow back bushy and beautiful. Do it after the blooms of spring have faded, so the plant has time to reestablish itself before the next phase of growth.  ","pick the right azalea for your garden. choose a shady planting spot. make sure the soil drains well. determine the soil's acidity. dig a hole and plant the azalea. water the azalea plant. mulch the area around azalea plants after the blooms fade. fertilize the azalea if required. trim away dead branches in the spring. do a light pruning after the blooms fade. do a drastic pruning when necessary.

"You actually need to purchase the the Coinvexed® trick. It can be bought from a magic shop or off the internet. The current version, Coinvexed 3® - The Third Generation - retails for £90 ($150 USD), but if you are a dedicated magician, you will be accustomed to this type of price tag. The looks of astonishment resulting from the trick are priceless and the coin bending implement can be expected to last a very long time, so, maybe, £90 is not such a high price tag.  You can likely find a cheaper price through judicious purchasing, that is, by shopping around.  You can choose to buy earlier versions of the magic apparatus which will probably have been used. There are two earlier models— Coinvexed 2® and the original version. Do know that the later versions are said to be incremental design improvements over the preceding generation.This means that the earlier versions will get the job done nearly as well.  It is probable that the earlier, used versions will come without the DVD that explains the showmanship and gives multiple angles of the actual trick being performed, so it is best to ask if the DVD is included before you buy a used product or assume that it will not be. It is not such a big deal not having the DVD (which is padded a bit with showmanship) because all you need to know will be provided in this article.  First and foremost, the DVD is a promotional tool to get you primed about the prospect of amazing and delighting your friends and neighbors. Still, use the fact (read line) that the trick comes without an essential (not really) part to leverage the price down. - Your parents would be so proud if they knew (or maybe not).;  , Once the package arrives, take everything out and examine the contents to make sure everything is included and has arrived undamaged.  When you open the trick, you should get a Sharpie with a metal lid that looks like a Sharpie lid. The metal lid will have a slit in the top and you will also get a metal object that you can stick coins to. Stick the coins to the pile and place the false lid on a Sharpie pen, colour of your choice.  ,,, The coin shouldn't fall and, if you do it properly, the coin should bend.  While you are bending the coin, make sure the viewer is doing something else, like signing a card for an *upcoming trick*.  At this point they should believe the coin isn't bent yet.

"You might be used to saying 'I want to find the woman of my dreams' but you need to know what this means for you, such as what her personality is, what she likes/dislikes or even looks like.  Think of key personality traits you consider important in a lifelong partner. Loyalty, generosity, fun-loving, outgoing, focused, and so forth. Which of your own personality traits do you want matched?  Think of the values you'd like this person to hold. Do you want her to have similar values to your own? Or, are you okay with her having quite different ones from you?  Consider your faith or lack of it. Does your ideal woman need to be of the same faith? Also consider family values––what are yours and in what way must hers match those?  What interests would you like this person to have? Does she have to have the same interests as you? Or would you prefer she had completely different interests, or a mixture of both? Is it enough that she's willing to learn about your interests?  Be frank with yourself about appearance. How important a factor is this? Might it be holding you back from finding someone with an amazing personality?  Be a devil's advocate. What sort of things do you not want in your ideal partner? What would you be willing and not willing to compromise about?;  , It is very hard for a person to measure up to an ideal or a creation of perfection in the mind. Having a dream notion of another human being can cause you to be blind to their faults initially, only to leave you extremely disappointed later when these become apparent because the dream is shattered. A realistic approach is to accept that no person is perfect and that it's important to recognize and understand the flawed sides of a person as much as seeing all the things you wish to see.  Realize that any person you date is a mixture of amazing traits and flaws. You are no different either.  You'll never find a woman to date if you expect her to be 100 percent perfect. No such person exists.  Learn to overlook imperfections that don't have a major impact on the relationship. If there are things that will have a major impact, don't be blind to them and realize early on that they could be deal breakers.  Looking for perfection may mean that you are too picky and won't ever find the woman who meets your expectations.  Realize that it takes time to get to know the real person underneath. If you have shallow ideals, you may never really get to know the amazing qualities of the woman unless you're prepared to take the time to get to know her.  Are you likely to be the ideal man of her dreams? Do you take good care of your health and appearance? Are you interesting? To attract a person, be attractive yourself. Most importantly, you need to understand yourself well, knowing your own identity and values. If you don't know these things, you will have a hard time defining boundaries in your relationship and you may fail to connect well, be afraid of commitment or not notice when you over-rely on the other person to define you.  What are your values and beliefs? Do you have these sorted out for yourself?  Do you know what your life's goals are and what matters to you?  Are you aware of your flaws? What are you doing to address them or manage around them?  Do you have an issue with perfection? If you consider yourself to be perfect, another person will find it hard to meet that, ever. Be willing to compromise and to see your flaws.  Are you truly ready for a long-term relationship yet? You need to know this in order to be serious about your pursuit.  Where do you find the woman of your dreams? This will depend on the kind of person you're looking for and your own interests. You'll be best off staying open to meeting a woman of your dreams anywhere you might be, so be aware at all times. That said, some of the things you can do to help you find this special person include looking where the possibilities are increased. Some examples include:  Look among your friends. Do they know of people who might be compatible with you? Ask them to keep an eye for someone with whom you might click.  Visit places where you like doing things. If you're sporty and you're looking for a woman who is also sporty, spend time doing that sport and keeping your eyes open. Join a club, take up a sport or become involved in triathlons, etc. if you're not already so involved.  Use online dating resources. There are many options here and you'll easily find matches to your criteria.  Go to social events. Mingle at parties, drinks events, dinner parties and even family events such as weddings and birthdays. You never know who you may bump into and the fun feeling of such occasions can help show people in their happiest light.  Join a hobby or activity class, club or event. For example, if you like dancing, join a dancing class or club.  Your daily commute. Maybe she sits next to you on the train or bus? Strike up a pleasant conversation if you keep seeing the same woman and feel you have a connection.  You could be walking down the street, doing your grocery shopping or waiting in a queue to pay a bill when you suddenly get a notion that you've found the one. No matter how much you plan and act, sometimes when finding love it's that lucky moment of crossing paths and realizing instantaneously that this is someone you'd like to get to know better.  You won't win any hearts by being gruff, rude or unpleasant to her or to her friends. Show her respect and treat her friends kindly. They will play a role in judging you and telling her what they think, so be sure it's going to be mostly good things they have to say.  Don't make an instant judgment as to whether or not this person is the woman of your dreams. It will take time to learn more about her, to get to know her personality and preferences, to find out just how compatible the two of you are. This means being realistic about setting aside the time to do this and not rushing the relationship or your judgment.  Make regular time for each other. Do fun things together to ensure that you enjoy one another's company.  Talk about values, beliefs and things you both care about. These are important aspects for both of you.  If it's all about you, she'll begin to feel that she's an appendage and not being treated as an individual. Take care not to fill the conversation space with everything you care about rather than allowing her plenty of space to share her thoughts too.  Find out all that you can about what she likes and dislikes. In turn, share your own likes and dislikes too. This can be an area of deal-breaking, so be aware of this at all times.  If you start talking about things that bore her to tears or bother her, tuck this information away for later reflection. Is this a problem for you or is it something you can live with?  , How the two of you cope with not agreeing with one another, having an argument or not seeing eye-to-eye will determine future conflict resolution. This is a valuable part of getting to know one another when determining if this is your dream woman.  Does she handle conflict well? Does she argue fairly to stand by her point without dismissing you?  Do you feel that you can work things out amicably when you don't agree with one another?  Can you see yourself spending a lifetime with this person, able to resolve disagreements in an acceptable way?  , Be real yourself and be genuine in how you interact with this woman. You can't expect to build strong foundations for a lifetime with the woman of your dreams if everything you've represented to her has been a fantasy. It'll all come tumbling down in the most painful way if you try to be something you're not. Instead, be real and let her get to know the person you really are. That way, you'll be absolutely certain that she's the woman of your dreams, because she connects with your true self.  ","define the woman of your dreams. be aware that whenever you focus on someone being 'a dream', you are manufacturing something that may not exist. consider your own contribution to this future relationship. begin looking. remember that luck plays a part in finding this person. be polite to the woman and to her friends. be prepared to get to know one another well. focus on getting to know her most. deal constructively with disagreement. keep things real.

"Saying and doing things that are too intimate or personal for the situation at hand is super awkward and creepy. Freak people out with one of the suggestions below, or make your own:  Propose to random strangers in random places. Be sure to choose places with some romantic value, like fountains, bridges, or Walmart.  Ask for advice with very personal problems. Involving people in problems that no sensible person would want to be a part of can be quite freaky indeed. Try asking strangers for advice treating hemorrhoids, for instance!  Act like you're old friends with a stranger. Talk to a stranger like you've known him or her since you were children. For instance, make bizarre inside jokes and try to get him or her to do a secret handshake that you make up as you go.  Make bizarre romantic remarks. Pretend that you've fallen in love with someone, but that you're hopelessly awkward. Shuffle up to someone and say something like, 'Hey.... I, uh... I, um. I like your glasses.'  Expose the world to personal arguments. On the phone (or with a willing friend), have a loud argument about something extremely personal, childish, or petty. You might try saying something like, 'I can't believe you ate the last waffle! This is so like you. You just walk into people's lives and take, take, take, but you never give!'  Interweave very revealing things in a normal conversation and continue with the normal conversation as if nothing untoward was said. For example: 'Can you direct me to the library? I grow horns on harvest moons. Is the library this way?'  ","be too personal. "

"There are many different salts available, and they all have different properties.The amount of Epsom salt (MgSO4) that you can dissolve into a given amount of water at a given temperature will differ from the amount of table salt (NaCl) that you can dissolve into the same water. If you are trying to understand the dissolution process in general, you should stick with using table salt.If you need to study the properties of a specific salt, use that salt.;  , The kind of water you use matters. For example, tap water has more contaminants than distilled water. Deionized water can often be even more pure than distilled water. The purer the water (i.e. the less contaminants it contains) the more salt you will be able to dissolve into it.This is because there are fewer water molecules acting on other substances in the water, and therefore, more molecules to act on your salt.  You will need to decide how much (how many grams) salt you intend to put into your water. You will also need to know how much water you are using. If you use too much salt (or too little water) then you will not be able to dissolve all of it.You can add salt slowly to see approximately how much can be dissolved in a given amount of water (at a given temperature).  You can dissolve more salt by adding more water or heating it up.  If you are measuring out a specific amount of water, you can use a graduated cylinder or a beaker. If you aren’t as worried about exact measurements, any container will do. Keep in mind that the temperature of the container can affect the temperature of your water. This isn’t a big deal for most experiments, but if you are doing highly controlled experiments, it is worth considering.Make sure to label your container, especially if you are working in a lab with other people.  Put weigh paper or a weigh boat on your scale and zero the scale. Add salt a little at a time until you reach the desired amount of salt. Record the exact amount of salt that you used., If the salt does not immediately dissolve, try mixing it with a spoon or spatula. You need water molecules to come in contact with your salt to dissolve it, and stirring things up helps that happen more quickly. You can also heat the mixture to help the salt dissolve., When you are analyzing how much salt you can or cannot dissolve into a given volume of water, you should consider the temperature. Warmer water will dissolve more salt than cooler water, regardless of the type of salt you are using. If you are doing a formal experiment, you should record the exact temperature of your water., The more solutes (things dissolved into the water) present, the less water molecules are available to interact with your salt. There can also be interaction between the solutes and the salt, depending on what solutes are present. If you are not studying the interaction of a specific solute with your salt, it is best to use distilled or deionized water to minimize the amount of contamination., Your water isn’t the only non-perfect substance you’ll be working with. Your salt is bound to have some level of impurity. If you purchased your salt, it is likely food or commercial grade and the impurities will be negligible for most experiments. If you made your own salt or mined your own salt, then impurities might be higher.  ","choose a salt. choose your water. decide how much of each you will use. pour your water into a container. weigh out your salt. pour the salt into the water. account for the temperature of the water. account for other solutes in the water. account for impurities in your salt.

"If your child plays sports or if they enjoy activities like biking or skateboarding, they should wear the proper protection. Mouthguards protect your child’s teeth from sudden impact, preventing the loss of teeth during an accident.You can get their dentist to create a specially fitted guard, or you can buy a “boil and bite” guard at a sports store., If your child does lose a permanent tooth, you can try to put it back in its socket, but it may not stay. In that case, you should save the tooth in a cup of milk or saline solution, and take the child to a dentist. No matter what you do, go to a dentist or emergency room immediately. Bring the tooth with you., If your child has a toothache or sore gums, you should call the dentist for an appointment. In the meantime, you can help reduce your child’s discomfort by using a few safe at-home remedies.  Mix a teaspoon of salt in a glass of warm water. Have your child swish this in their mouth without swallowing. After 30 seconds, they can spit it out. This can help reduce pain in their teeth and gums.For a toothache, apply a few drops of clove oil to a cotton ball. Gently rub the oil against the sore tooth. An over-the-counter medication, such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen, can stop severe pain. Use a pain reliever marked as safe for children, and follow the instructions on the box carefully., Too much fluoride can cause a condition called enamel fluorosis. The condition can produce problems like discoloration and pitting. While fluoride toothpaste is necessary to prevent cavities, you should use no more than a pea-sized amount when your child is brushing their teeth.  ","make the child wear protective gear during sports. save the tooth if it is knocked out. treat pain with homemade remedies. avoid using too much fluoride. "
"This is a great way to dry leaves for crafts, but some color fading will occur. Place fresh leaves on top of two paper towels. Cover them with another single layer of paper towel.  Use freshly fallen leaves that are still vibrant and pliable. Avoid leaves that are curling at the ends or those that have rips or rotted spots.  For best results, leave a little space in between each leaf to prevent them from sticking together as they dry.  Place the leaves in the microwave and heat them for 30 seconds. Afterward, continue microwaving the leaves in 5-second intervals.Autumn leaves will generally need to be microwaved 30 to 180 seconds before they are sufficiently dry.  Be very attentive when microwaving leaves. If cooked too long, leaves can actually catch fire.  Leaves that appear scorched have been microwaved too long. Leaves that curl at the ends after being removed from the microwave have not been microwaved long enough.  Store the leaves in a draft-free, shady area. Leave them there overnight, at minimum, or for two days, at maximum. If you notice a change in color, the leaves should be sealed immediately.  Spray both sides of each leaf with clear acrylic craft spray to preserve the remaining color. Let the leaves dry before using them as decorations or for crafts.  ","sandwich fresh leaves between paper towels. microwave the leaves to dry them out. let the leaves sit out overnight. seal the leaves with craft spray. "
"Like most people, you probably feel the drive to make more money, get more things, and look better. However, extraordinary people realize that these things don't matter as much as learning to focus on the things that make you truly happy.For instance, being in a relationship with people you love and trust is important, and that doesn't have to be sexual. Friendships can be just as important as having a lifetime partner. You just need to be with people that you trust enough to be emotionally vulnerable with.  This step also means valuing experiences over things. Things just fill up your house, while experiences make you feel alive and invigorated.  Part of what makes life enjoyable is the experiences you have, from eating a fabulous dinner to watching a sunrise to taking a painting class. When life gets busy, you're likely to find excuses not to have new experiences, as everyone does. But making sure you take the time to get out and try new things is integral to making you an extraordinary person.Think of it this way. When you think of extraordinary people, do you think of someone who sits at home every night? No, extraordinary people have extraordinary and interesting experiences.  Start making plans. Decide you're going to try at least one new thing a week, and stick to it. Making plans with other people can help you stick to it.  Also, don't be afraid to be spontaneous. Feel like going to the beach? Take a mental health day from work and take that three hour drive down to the beach. Sure, you'll be tired at the end of the day, but you'll also feel exhilarated and more alive.  Just like the experiences you have, your passions help make your life fuller and you a more interesting person. Following your passions helps engage your curiosity and keep your spark of life alive.Maybe you've lost touch with your love of painting, but it used to make you happy. Try picking it up again. Join a club in your area, or find a class at your local community college.  If you're not sure what you're really passionate about, start exploring interests. Check out books from the library on hobbies and ideas that catch your attention, or start taking community college classes that catch your interest. If you hear about an event that piques your interest, go to it to see what it's about.  Sometimes, when that moment of pure joy comes around, you may find yourself not giving into it. You're holding back a bit because you're afraid of when the next bad thing is going to hit. However, learning to really dig down into joyfulness can make you a more joyful person overall, and in turn, a more extraordinary person, as few people are able to live joyfully.  The next time you find yourself in a happy situation, take some time to be in the moment. Let yourself fill up with the emotion. Take in the joy on the faces of people around you. Savor the sensations of the food you're eating or the feeling of sand and water between your toes.  Gratitude is sometimes hard when life throws curve balls at you left and right. Nonetheless, being grateful is another way to learn how to live an extraordinary life because it helps you appreciate what you have and what's most important to you, a rare quality.One way you can learn gratitude is to take time each day to think or write about things you are grateful for. You could write down 3 things each day in a journal that you are thankful for or even post 3 things you are grateful for on social media every day for your friends to see. You could also just take time each night to think about the things you are grateful for in your life.  Express your gratitude. When you're thankful for a person or what they've done, tell that person. Writing a note is even better, because it makes you take time to really feel that gratitude. Plus, it lets the other person know they are appreciated.  ","pay attention to what matters most. experience things rather than make excuses. find time for your passions. revel in joyfulness. learn to be grateful. "

"A great way to begin building accountability at work is seeking feedback from the people you work with. Depending on what your job entails, specifically regarding your position in a hierarchy, you can seek feedback from those above you, those on your level, and those under you.Your job may already have specific performance standards in place which are reviewed periodically by supervisors, but you can show your boss that accountability is important to you by actively seeking extra feedback about your performance. You might seek feedback regarding a specific project or assignment you recently finished, or you might want get a general idea for how you are doing.;  , It’s also good to seek feedback from the people you work with day to day, even when they have no power or authority over you. You need to know whether the people you work with can count on you or not.  Be sure to ask questions that are specific to get the feedback you desire. For example, you might say something like, 'I worked really hard on that presentation, but I'd love some feedback on where I could improve. Do you have any input?'  , As a manager, or any upper level position, you don’t want to make all the decisions on your own and never ask how people feel you are leading. Approach subordinates in the right way so you don’t seem like you lack authority. Just be genuine and tell those below you that you want to know how they think you are doing at your job.  Try creating an anonymous survey that you can distribute to your employees. This may provide you with more honest feedback because they will be less likely to worry about the comments they make backfiring on them.  Asking your boss, peers, and subordinates for feedback on your performance is useless if you don’t take the feedback into consideration and find ways to implement it. Maybe you can’t do exactly what the critique entails, but you can use it as a springboard for making changes.  You may spend a lot of time working with a team, and the results are the culmination of everyone’s effort. In some settings, it may be possible to hide or be a little dishonest about the work you accomplished. Being accountable means fully owning up to whatever comes of your work.This is hardest when you have made a mistake or have not quite made the best of an opportunity you have been given. It may feel natural to shift the blame or make excuses that focus on outside forces, but being upfront and honest about your work is an important aspect of accountability. Owning up to shortcomings will show the people you work with and for that you are not trying to hide anything.  When you do mess up, and you have to be honest with someone about the mistake, it is always good to have an idea or plan for how to remedy the situation. Being honest and owning the mistake is the first step, but there is most likely still something that needs to happen. Having a solution to the problem ready when you admit the mistake will help ease the tension and show that you are not giving up.  If you work in an office and you usually have your door open, try shutting it for a couple days. An open door invites people to stop and talk, even if it isn’t about work. Closing the door more often will give you the privacy to focus more on work and less on interacting with people., In a given day of work, you might have five or more things that need to get done. However, not all of the tasks have the same level of priority. Get in the practice of working on the most important things first and putting off the things that can wait., For less important tasks, force yourself to limit how long you spend on them. Don’t spend a whole hour clearing out spam email if someone is waiting for an email response from you. Knock out an important task that you know will take a while, and then balance it with a short, lower priority task. Alternating in this way can boost your efficiency.  At the end of the day, or periodically throughout the day, write down what you do and how long you spend doing it. You may be surprised where your time actually goes. It’s probably best not to show your boss this log, but it will help you see what is draining your time and you can work on reducing those time-wasters.  ","seek feedback from your boss. ask your peers how you are doing. ask your subordinates how you can improve. implement the feedback you receive. be honest about the results of your work. make time for solo work. prioritize your tasks. set specific time limits. keep a time log of how you spend each day for a week.

"There can be a number of reasons but the main impetus is observation of how other people live and behave under different circumstances. And watching people is not about feeling superior to others or judging them; more than anything, you're a non-judgmental observer with a penchant for unearthing life's stories as an art of love and empathy. Some reasons for people watching include:  It's relaxing and enjoyable - Seeing other people have fun, dressed up, going about daily activities is enjoyable and even soothing as you sit somewhere comfortable in a cafe or park bench under the sun. People are fascinating, so this reason really needs no more explanation!  It passes time while you're waiting for someone or while you're sitting with people who don't interest you much but you're obliged to stay with them.  It restores a sense of wonder. Children are renowned for people watching and just by trying it again, you can regain this sense of wonder for a brief moment of time.  It's informative. If you're writing a book or developing characters for a play, observing people can be an excellent way to find traits and styles for your characters. In addition, if you're an actor, observing other people is a window to other ways of standing, walking, talking, and interacting in a natural environment. And it's a great opportunity to test your learning or theories about body language.  It's an excellent source of artwork or photography. If you're an artist or a photographer, unaware people can make brilliant subjects.  It's inspiring. Watching people can lead to writing a symphony, movie script, or a blog post.  It's a healthy and much more interesting alternative to Facebook or Instagram stalking.;  , Naturalistic observation is the practice of observing subjects in their natural habitat.This means being unobtrusive, unnoticed, and non-interfering. The moment you become any of these things, the spell is broken and you've interacted and it's no longer 'people watching'.  Realize that some places are better for people watching than others. New York City, Paris, Miami, Rio de Janeiro and Venice present ideal venues for people watching because people know they're on display, and being seen. Any city where people dress up to show the world their fashion flair or sense of style is likely to be an ideal people watching place. Less so the country town or the little city unless you can do so with great care and not draw attention to yourself.  Some observation methods are likely to be more acceptable in some places than in others. Taking photos of people in New York City usually won't have anyone blink an eyelid; doing so in the only main street of a local town might raise concerns. Know where it's fine to take shots of people and where it's frowned upon and don't cross that line. If someone does see you taking photos of them and they don't like it, oblige them by erasing the shot; this isn't about causing bad feelings.  The tried and true locale is sitting in a cafe looking out on a busy street. This is the classic Parisian positioning and even if it's cold, find yourself a suitably large and clean window to peer through. There are plenty of other options though, including:  Upstairs balcony of a shopping center.  Under a tree at the park, sitting around at lookouts,or anywhere that tourists and locals like to congregate.  Sitting around a public pool or at the beach; at a party or a rave (it's interesting to watch how people change as the event goes on).  As people enter or leave a movie theater, play, doctor's office, etc.  Taverns, pubs, bars, etc.  Theme parks, zoos, aquariums, and other places where your feet invariably get sore and you just need to sit down and watch the world pass by.  Dog runs. Where dogs socialize, so are their owners.  Stores, including thrift stores and bookstores.  Art galleries and museums.Observing people observing something else can be very entertaining, especially those people who discuss what the subjects in the painting are thinking - how far can you peel this Russian doll?!  Don't neglect public transportation; it's prime people-watching territory as you're all glued to the spot staring at one another!  , The important thing is to place yourself somewhere that you won't look conspicuous. This means making it appear that you're already occupied and not simply staring at people:  Look busy by reading, writing, or have something else to do while you watch.  Eat a meal or drink coffee or tea while you watch.  Wear sunglasses that make it hard to tell where you're looking.  Find a person who grabs your attention and who isn't about to disappear before you've a chance to observe them properly. While observing them, think about what sort of person they might be:  Ask yourself questions about each person you choose: Why are they here? Are they happy? Nervous? Irritable? Why? What does the way they hold themselves say about them? What about the way they talk? Does it match up?  Look at their clothes: What do their clothes suggest about them? Are they wealthy or poor? Are they stylish or completely clueless about fashion? Are they adequately dressed for the weather or not? Are they part of any pop culture or sub-culture?  From their style and mannerisms, what do you think this person's aspirations, politics, or job would be?  Spot 'doppelgangers'. This means trying to see people who look like people you know or well-known people such as movie stars. Who knows, you might even see a real one!  Do you recognize anyone? As you age, the people passing by you might be former lovers, bosses, teachers, or classmates. Keep your attention focused!  , It can be twice the fun to people watch with a friend who is attuned to the art of people watching. Ask one another the questions outlined in the step above. You can even dispute each other's findings until you reach a shared conclusion that pleases both of you! Being able to share your thoughts on people watching can be both a fun and deeply connecting friendship ritual.  This step is optional and for some people might turn people watching into a bit of a chore. However, if you're absolutely dedicated to people watching as a regular hobby, you might enjoy recording your thoughts about the people you've observed, and if you're an author (including bloggers) or an artist, you can build on these observations to inspire your writing or art.  Carry a notebook and pen around with you on days you decide to people watch. Make it a special book just for that purpose - turn the event into a ceremony. Write down the details of what you see and hear from each person, if you can sketch the way they hold themselves. It'll keep the process interesting and you'll have subjects to keep for years.  Consider your observed people potential character stock for your novels and record every mannerism.  Take painting or acting classes if you'd like to record your people watching moments unobtrusively without a camera.  So that you don't come across as a voyeur or nosy body, be conscious of other people's need for privacy, space, and respect people at all times. Realize that you too are likely the subject of observation now and then, perhaps even as you're people watching one fine afternoon.  Sometimes you will get caught observing and it will be considered staring. There are a number of ways to respond:  Simply smile, shrug, and look away.  Engage them in conversation if close enough, and explain what was so engaging or beautiful about them that made you look again.  Just look down and don't look up again until they've gone. For when you're feeling a little sheepish or afraid!  Physically turn away or get up and go if things seem uncomfortable.  ","decide the parameters of your people watching - it helps to know why you're watching. practice naturalistic observation not intrusive nosiness. select a location to watch from. stay unobtrusive. select a person on the street or nearby. people watch with a pal. record the above thoughts on the person. watch with good intent. know how to react if the observed observes back.

"A flat table or workbench will work best for this craft. Lay down a few sheets of newspaper or a drop cloth to prevent paint from getting on your work surface. The supplies needed for this craft are available at most craft stores.Be sure the box you buy is made of unfinished wood. Finished wood might not paint over easily, or might require you to remove the paint before painting.  When selecting a paint, check its label instructions. Here you’ll find information on the surfaces the paint is suited for and whether or not it needs primer.  Use a clean, dry cloth to remove any dust or dirt on your box. Open your paint and prepare it according to its directions. Dip a paintbrush into the paint and remove excess paint by wiping the brush on the inner lip of the can. Cover your box in paint. Allow the paint to dry completely.You may have to remove the hinge from your box to effectively paint its nooks and crannies. This can usually be done easily with a screwdriver.  The brand of paint you’ve used will influence the time it takes the paint to dry. Check its label to find out how long your paint needs to dry.  Some brands of paint or colors may require multiple coats. Generally, multiple thin coats will be stronger and have a smoother finish., Find a small bowl or container that’s roughly the size of your box. Turn it over on top of your fabric. Trace the outline of the bowl with a pencil or piece of chalk. Cut out this circle with your scissors.The circle that you cut out doesn’t have to be perfect. The edges of it will be tucked down into the sides of the box and hidden from sight.  Depending on your box, you may need to experiment with the fabric outline. Overestimating size is easier to correct and only requires you to remove excess fabric with scissors.  This ribbon will attach to both rings, holding them in place on the pillow. Position your ribbon left-to-right across the middle of the fabric. Thread your needle and pass it through the front of the ribbon and fabric then back again. Do this several times along the center of the ribbon. Tie off both ends with knots.  If you’re not confident in your sewing skills, you may be able to attach the ribbon to the fabric with a little bit of hot glue.  You may want to trim your ribbon down so it is more manageable. Loose ends can be tucked into the sides of the box., Insert the stuffing into your ring box and cover it with your fabric. Tuck the sides of the fabric between the stuffing and the box. Arrange the fabric so the ribbon is directly in the center of the box. Your ring bearer box is ready for the aisle.  Alternatively, you could sew a hem into your fabric and run an elastic string or band through the hem. Stuff the inside with padding and you’re done.  When the moment comes, remember to attach your rings with the ribbon and tie them in place with a bow.

"If the stress comes from difficulties in your relationship, make a distinction between such problems and the relationship itself. You shouldn't let one single difficulty affect the entire relationship.  Find out what doesn't work in the relationship and address this specific issue by using what does work as a point of strength., What makes a reaction different from a response is its intensity and emotional subtext. Think your answers through. If one implies anger, sarcasm, accusations, it's a reaction. This will only turn communication into a table-tennis match where the goal is to win rather than to find a solution. However, a team always plays on the same side.Don't phrase your comments as judgments or blame your partner out of spite. This can only lead to further stress and misunderstanding.You can do this by focusing on future objectives rather than past actions. If you were disappointed at your partner's not doing the dishes, seize the next occasion to ask them to do the dishes, without mentioning the fact that they didn't in the past.  Don't invalidate your partner's opinions just to win an argument. Proving yourself right might be good for your ego, but it never makes a team stronger.Understand that, when we're angry, communication follows war patterns: aggression and defense. You should avoid both, and try to bring the conversation back to equal terms. Express ideas as positive statements, without using them as weapons or shields., If your partner's tone becomes aggressive or judgmental, point it out gently and ask what was behind the message. What we say is usually not as important as why we said it. This will help you address the original source of stress, instead of spending time arguing over a harsh reply.Be tolerant if your partner has a bad reaction. If this happens repeatedly, point out this is not a useful discussion. It will never lead to a solution but only further stress., This is the golden rule of any relationship. Showing each other respect through what you say or do will decrease the level of stress, whether the source is external or internal.Respect means having equal power in a relationship. What you say or do is just as important as what your partner says or does. Stress, instead, always derives from a power imbalance. For example, one of the two partners might be overly controlling or submissive., Stress can also come from failed expectations. If that is the case, the problem is in what you expected rather than what your partner failed to provide. You chose your partner with all his or her faults and weaknesses, not as a fixer-upper. Love rests on acceptance and confidence.A consequence of acceptance is forgiveness. Your partner might have done something wrong. If your relationship is what matters the most, however, you should let go instead of holding grudges.  Every relationship calls for continuous rearrangements and resolutions of conflicts. If communication is smooth and equal, negotiation happens as a natural process. This also means you should know how to lose or give up an argument, if that's not what matters the most to you.  Surrendering doesn't mean passively fulfilling all of your partner's wants. It is an active choice to downsize your desire to be always right or in control. However, this must also occur on a mutual basis. If you're the one surrendering all the time, there is a power imbalance that needs to be worked out., If you think stress has had too much of an impact on your relationship and that you and your partner cannot solve the problem on your own, discuss with him or her the possibility of seeking professional help. A counselor will offer an objective point of view and help you focus on strategies to attack the problem.If your partner doesn't want to join you, you can still meet with a counselor or therapist on your own. This will provide an external outlet where you can take out your stress and get professional advice on how to deal with it.  ","isolate the problem in your relationship. give responses, not reactions. discuss rough reactions openly. respect your partner and expect respect in return. trust and accept your partner as he or she is. be open to negotiation and surrender. talk to a relationship coach if needed.

"Maintain a healthy diet. Eat more green leafy vegetables and increase your protein and calcium (drinking milk is one easy way to increase your intake of both of these).  Every morning, eat a good, healthy breakfast.  Drink plenty of water. Since your body is mostly water, you have to be hydrated.  The most important thing is to balance everything. If you don't, you will not be completely flexible.;  , Start your workout with low-impact stretches and work up to a full stretch workout. Later, wind down your routine with low-impact exercising.  If you have no idea what you are doing you'll undoubtedly injure yourself. Most martial arts schools and gymnastics classes have extensive programs and teachers available. Check them out.  Keep it symmetrical. If you are stretching your left, stretch out your right too. If you are bending forward, bend backwards too.  If you don't feel a little strain in your muscles, you're not doing it in a way that will prove beneficial. A little strain is normal.  It takes time but you will get there. Tell yourself motivating things, such as: 'I know I can do this!'  , The key to being flexible is waiting calmly.  This is important if you want to become flexible! Remember, you can't become flexible overnight. Work at the rate you are comfortable with, and then slowly increase the difficulty (length of time, length of reach or both).  When you are doing stretches, wear comfortable gear, such as tank top and shorts, leotard, and so forth.  Do warm ups before beginning stretches. One way to warm up would to be to do a decent amount of jumping jacks.  Starting with difficult and advanced stretches is dangerous and ill-advised for anyone. Begin from the easier stretches, then move on to the harder ones.  The following sections provide a list of basic, good stretching exercises for your body. Be careful, take them slowly and become comfortable with them before pushing yourself.  ","pay attention to what you eat and ensuring that you are getting adequate nutrition. keep your joints and muscles stretched and cared for. make sure you have supervision when performing stretches. remember to include both the positive and negative motions when you stretch. think positive when you're becoming flexible. remember you must always be patient. do stretches every day (for at least 10 to 15 minutes) and work at it progressively.

"Many destinations come with certain health risks. This is especially true if you are traveling internationally, but also important for domestic travel as well. You should find out about any health risks at least six to eight weeks before you travel so you can get any needed vaccinations.You can visit your doctor or a travel clinic to discuss any risks associated with your travel destination.  Make sure you vaccinations are current. Find out if you need any additional vaccines for diseases prevalent in the area where you’ll be traveling.  Before you travel anywhere, check to make sure there are no travel health notices. You can usually find these on news sites or government pages, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Preventon's Travel Health Notice page., When traveling, be careful not to get sick from eating contaminated food. Hepatitis A and typhoid fever are contracted through contaminated food.Depending on where you are traveling, the food may not be safe to eat. Make sure to do research about where you are going and if there are concerns about the food. If unsure, make sure to eat hot food that has been thoroughly cooked.Be careful when eating raw fruit and vegetables. If you are in a country prone to contaminated food, don’t eat it unless you can peel it. You can also boil or cook it.  Don’t eat raw foods, like salads and shellfish.  Be wary with foods from street vendors.  Drinking contaminated water can lead to sickness and is a major concern when traveling, especially in developing countries. If water is a concern where you are traveling, make sure you to only drink bottled water or water that has been boiled. Sealed drinks, like carbonated beverages, should be fine.Don’t drink ice in your drinks in high-risk areas — remember ice is just frozen water.  In high-risk areas, don’t bathe, brush your teeth, swim, or wade in untreated water. This includes water from the tap.  Traveling to some countries puts you at a higher risk for certain illnesses. Some of these illnesses require preventative medications that you take before, during, and after your trip. Talk to your doctor about your travel plans to see if you need preventative medicine.For example, if you are traveling to countries that have a high risk of malaria, you need preventative medicine for malaria.  Infected animals can spread diseases to you through contact with their fluids or eating food from a contaminated animal, like meat, fish, or dairy products. Stay away from any animals, wild or domestic.Don’t pet dogs or monkeys in developing countries.  Refrain from feeding animals.

"Many states offer a state-sponsored 529 plan for college investment. Each state determines the structure and options that go along with its own plan. Some states offer matching grants and other benefits to in-state residents who buy into the state-sponsored 529 plan.Some of the benefits of investing in your own state’s sponsored 529 plan are:state tax deductions  matching grants  scholarship opportunities  protection from creditors  exemption from state financial aid calculations;  , If you look at plans from states other than the one where you reside, you may find that another state offers a plan with strong benefits and does not have an in-state residence requirement. You might not benefit from all the options that are available to an in-state resident, but you may find that other benefits are still strong enough to make it a good choice.The College Savings Plans Network, CSPN.org, has a search feature that makes it easy to compare plans from multiple states.  The Private College 529 Plan is a prepaid tuition plan that is owned and sponsored through a consortium of over 270 private colleges and universities around the country. A private plan will not provide the tax benefits that many state-sponsored plans provide. However, it is still an excellent way to save for college and secure your investment over time. By locking in the college credits now, you are guaranteed to have the payments for college in the future., A prepaid tuition plan allows you to lock in tuition rates at today’s prices, at eligible public and private universities. Most prepaid tuition plans are sponsored by the state government and have some residence requirements. These plans generally have a limited enrollment period. Your investment in a prepaid tuition plan is guaranteed by your state, in most cases. With a prepaid tuition plan, you generally purchase “credits” or “units” at today’s rates. When your child attends college, the plan will pay for the number of credits purchased, at the future tuition rate. So while your money does not exactly earn interest in the traditional sense, you can determine the growth by comparing tuition costs over time.  Selecting a state-sponsored plan does not lock you in to a state college or university. With most plans, the money that you invest can be used for tuition and fees and any college or university, public or private.  These fees will generally be enrollment fees and administrative management fees.The fees will vary from state to state, so ask before you invest.  With a college savings plan, you invest in a choice of investment options, such as stock mutual funds, bond mutual funds and money market accounts. The money is invested and managed by a broker. Investments are more flexible than most prepaid tuition plans, but the money is not guaranteed by the state. Your investments are subject to fluctuations in the market and may even decrease in value., This type of plan is likely to have enrollment fees, annual maintenance fees, and, depending on the broker who is selling or investing the account, a range of additional broker’s fees. The fees will vary depending on the broker and the investments that you select. Ask questions about fees and get informed before you invest your money.You may be able to reduce your broker’s fees if you invest a large enough amount of money and maintain the stated minimum balance. Ask the broker about these “break-point discounts” if you are interested.  In some states, you can buy directly into a college savings plan without paying some of the fees associated with other plans. If a plan is labeled as “Direct Sold,” then you are buying directly into the plan, without the use of an adviser or broker, and thus can avoid some fees.  ","check your state’s plan. consider plans from other states. investigate privately sponsored 529 plans. consider a prepaid tuition plan for more security. be aware of the fees for a prepaid tuition plan. choose a college investment plan for additional flexibility. be aware of the fees for a college investment plan. look for “direct sold college savings plans” to avoid paying some fees.

"Are you bothered by a lack of social skills? Do you struggle with superficial conversations, showing your feelings, experience frequent awkward pauses in conversations, or other practical problems? Perhaps you manage to come across sociable enough, but still wish you didn't always feel so uncomfortable and insecure.  Also ask yourself how much you really want to change – not everyone is or can be a social butterfly. Don't waste efforts comparing yourself to others. Don't tell yourself that you should be like them. This is simply negative reinforcement, which will only make you feel like you are different, alone, and, in extreme cases, even inferior.;  , Socially anxious individuals frequently have a stream of negative thoughts running through their heads. 'I look awkward,' 'No one is talking to me,' or 'I am going to look like an idiot,' are all thoughts that may run on a loop. As you can probably tell, these thoughts are all negative and will only serve to keep you feeling shy and self-conscious.  Aim to break the habit of negative thoughts by becoming aware of when you are falling prey to them and by challenging their logic. For example, just because you are nervous in a crowd or at a party does not mean you look awkward. Others around you may be getting a case of nerves, too.  Reframing means not just taking a positive spin on your thoughts, but also a more realistic perspective. Many negative thoughts are rooted in irrational beliefs. Find evidence that disputes your negative thoughts and find another way of looking at the situation., This is one of the most important aspects of shyness and social anxiety. Most shy people don't do this on purpose, but often, attention is consistently drawn to yourself during conversations. This makes you self-aware and keeps a vicious cycle rotating. Research has shown this may play a key role in why people might experience panic attacks after relatively mild anxious moments.Rather than noticing that you are being shy, or that you may have said something embarrassing, try to take a light-hearted approach to perceived deficits. Laugh it off or carry on without bringing too much attention to what you believe is a flaw. Most people will empathize – feeling connected as a human is easier than you might think.  Show interest in other people and/or the surroundings. You may feel like everyone is watching you, but generally, people are not judging you. Distorted perception is the culprit in this situation. Others are busy doing their own thing, and, in most cases, are not out to get you.  A common misconception is that shy people are introverts. Introverts, in fact, enjoy solitude and recharge by spending time alone. On the contrary, people who are shy desperately want to engage with others but fear scrutiny or judgement., Imitation is the highest form of flattery. Of course, you shouldn't go and do exactly what you see another person do, but watching someone who is socially adept can give you some ideas on how to handle certain situations.  If you know these individuals well enough, you can even be candid with them and outright ask for advice. Let them know that you notice they seem to be very comfortable in social settings and see if they can give you any pointers. You might just get a surprise and find out that one of the people you admire for their social abilities is actually just as shy as you.  Sometimes, extreme shyness is a sign of social anxiety disorder. Individuals with this disorder are terribly fearful of being scrutinized or judged by others to the point that they have little or no friendships or romantic relationships.Your mental health provider can help you to diagnose social anxiety disorder and work with you to develop healthier thought patterns and the confidence to stop avoiding people and social situations.  Would you approach somebody with a sour expression on their face or with their head down on their desk? Not likely. Our body language can allow others to make assumptions about us before we even speak. Refrain from looking down at your shoes and try for a small, confident smile and eye contact instead.  Open body language sends a message to others that you are willing to interact with them. Sit leaning forward in the direction of the person you are talking to, keep your legs and arms open, and maintain a relaxed posture.  Recognize that your body language not only determines how people perceive you but also how you perform. Research shows that certain power poses – like a relaxed posture and open arms – depict when a person is feeling in charge and victorious. On the other hand, closing in on oneself like in the fetal position depict helplessness or vulnerability.  One popular Ted Talk shows how these positions of dominance and power are universal throughout all living things – human, primates, even birds. The speaker's premise is, if we purposefully go into these 'power' positions when we are feeling insecure, we begin to believe it. This means that you have the power to control your confidence level in any given situation.Striking a power pose for two to five minutes can actually alter your brain chemistry, increasing testosterone and decreasing stress hormones. Even simply visualizing these poses can make you feel more confident and help you begin taking risks.  The best way to meet people is to actively seek out places where you can meet people. Go to the Fall Dance party at your school or the office Christmas get-together. Try to meet at least one person by the end of the night. Find the local Open Mic & read some poetry you wrote in your college days.  One researcher said the best outlet for him to overcome shyness around people was to get a job at a fast food restaurant. Working at McDonald's during his adolescence forced him to interact with complete strangers on a daily basis. He is still self-conscious in some social situations, but he credits that experience with helping him to become more successful despite his shyness.Ask friends of yours to introduce you to some of their friends or acquaintances. This is a great way to meet new people. Plus, you don't have to worry about knowing everyone because the one person you know will act as a buffer. Talk to this person for awhile and then slowly branch out and strike up conversations with mutual friends.  Even though this may sound strange, stand in front of a mirror or close your eyes; imagine yourself talking to someone. Feeling like you are prepared before you enter into an unfamiliar social setting can help you minimize anxiety. See your interactions as more like role-play in a movie. Imagine yourself as the gregarious person that draws in others. Then, get out there and put your practice to work.  Amplifying your strengths will not only make you feel more confident when around others, but will also make you seem more interesting and inviting. For example, if you like art, consider painting sets for a play. It will be easier to shine if you feel comfortable. Find ways to engage with others that share the same passions or interests as you. You can attract many new friends simply by doing what you know and seeming to enjoy it.  No need to be over the top. Some of the greatest conversations started with 'I like your shirt. Did you get it at (store name)?' Compliments naturally give others a positive impression of you because you made them feel good. What's more, you are guaranteed to walk away with a smile because complimenting others makes you feel good, too.If you know the person, use their name when you give a compliment. Also, be specific. Don't just say 'You look great' say 'I like your new hairstyle. The color is really flattering with your skin tone'.  Strive to give three to five compliments a day to a variety of people that you meet on the street and in your daily activities. Try not to select the same person twice. See how many conversations get started and how many people you leave feeling better than when you met them.  Try to make progress in small, easily broken down, and identifiable steps. This gives you something new to learn every time, and you can proudly keep track of progress. Keep doing things like having conversations with new people and seeking out opportunities to connect with others. And, celebrate small wins, whether it is giving a few compliments or challenging your negative thoughts.  ","consider what you want to change and why. reframe your thinking. focus your attention outward, not on yourself. observe how others with confidence navigate the social scene. see a mental health professional if you have trouble overcoming shyness on your own. be approachable. put yourself out there. practice talking. showcase your talents. give sincere compliments. take small steps.

"If you have loose leaves, you need to create your teabags. Do this by stuffing your loose tea leaves into a store-bought teabag. You can purchase paper teabags online, the grocery store, or at a cafe. Use one heaping teaspoon (1.5 g) of tea leaves per eight ounces (236.58 mL) of water.If you've purchased your Rooibos tea already in teabags, you can skip this step.;  , Fill your teapot with water and then place it on top of your stovetop. Set the heat to high and boil the water. Rooibos tea tastes best when boiled at 212°F (100°C). You can use a food thermometer to determine the heat of your water.If you don't have a teapot you can use a regular pot.  You can purchase spring water in bottles from the store.  Purifying your water in a home filter, like a Brita, will also enhance the taste of your tea.Rooibos tea tastes the best with filtered or spring water, but can also be made with the distilled water from your faucet.  Put your tea bag in the cup before pouring the boiling water into it. Consider adding two bags of tea in your cup if you enjoy stronger tasting tea. You can also put any additional ingredients in your tea at this time, like sweeteners or creamers. If you do put additives, make sure to mix them in afterward., Let your tea steep for at least four to five minutes. To get the most out of your rooibos tea, allowing it to steep for up to ten minutes releases nutrients and antioxidants from the leaves. Rooibos tea must steep for a longer time than other teas.  ","stuff tea bags with loose tea leaves. boil filtered or spring water. place your tea bag and hot water in a mug or cup. let your tea steep. "
"That means no monkeys, koalas, or pandas. However, if you feel like they are good animal choices, choose them. Wolves, foxes, snow leopards, arctic wolves, and bunnies are the recommendation of many Jammers.;  , Names like 'Baron Cool Scurvy' aren't cool at all. Names like 'Major Major major' or 'Mythical Thecat' makes you sound experienced. Be sure that these names fit your animal. If you're a penguin, don't make the suffix horse, seal, wolf, etc. This goes for all animals.  If you are still in your starting colors, change them. Don't go for anything too wild or crazy. Also, if you're a girl, don't go for all pink. Most jammers that are rabbits change their pattern to spotted. For wolves, arctic wolves, foxes, and snow leopards, black, white, gray, red, and blue is best recommended. For snow leopard's spots, make them the opposite of your color, or a lighter or darker shade of your original color.  Fake it until you make it! If you can't quite get your paws on something rare, purchase the silver glove (available at Epic Wonders in Coral Canyons). Many people confuse it for a plain white glove; therefore making you appear more rare.  Don't go insane with color, but wear things that match or are close to your animal's color. Wear wings if they look good on you. Depending on the size of the animal, wings will look different. Rabbits look adorable, and wolves look too large. Avoid the butterfly wings; as they are almost always in stock. Buy clothes at stores that everyone ignores, an example is the new store in Appondale. Newer Jammers might think they are worth plenty because they haven't seen it in Jamaa Outfitters.  Many Jammers make the mistake of getting a randomly colored pet instead of one that matches. Having a purple and neon green hamster while you're brown looks strange.  There are video tutorials on this if you need help.  Speak with proper grammar. Use your shift key, know when to add an apostrophe, and add punctuation at the end of every sentence. It may take a few more seconds to type, but you'll come off as mature. You can have free chat when you're a member.  These don't have to be relatively rare, but at least put a few on.  Steer clear from items you can buy. Items like the tiara and necklace are always in stores and having them on your trade list is worthless. Play Phantom Invasion a few times and put your rewards on your list.  Play many different games, gain as many gems as possible, buy at least 25 clothing items; these are all way to get achievements. If you need, look up a list of them and how to earn them.  Buy some furniture, and go on a serious Journey Book find. But make sure your den isn't cluttered!

"Lay a towel flat. Place the Lycra item in the center of the towel. Next, fold the edges up over the clothing. Roll up the clothing. Gently squeeze out excess water, then lay the towel and clothing flat again., Heat and direct sunlight are damaging to the stretchy Lycra fibers. To keep your clothing fresh, pick a safe area. Find an out of the way area where you can lay out a towel.Hang drying is a quicker alternative, but the water pulling downwards will stretch out the Lycra over time.  Avoid using an iron on full Lycra clothing. On Lycra blends, if you still want to risk ironing, use as low a heat setting as possible.  Set the laundry bag filled with Lycra items in the dryer. The heat of a dryer can be harmful to the stretch of the fabric, so pick the lowest heat setting you can find.

"Consider that at what time on Valentine’s Day you break up with your partner may have a big impact on how your break up goes. Weigh the pros and cons of breaking up as early as possible in the day, versus waiting to the middle or even end of the day.  Doing it early in the day may be the gentlest time on Valentine’s Day to break up. Going through the motions of caring for someone during Valentine’s Day can end up doing more damage than breaking up.Also, this way your new ex will hopefully still have time to cancel any plans she may have made for the day.  Consider the end of the day. Breaking up with someone on Valentine’s Day morning might leave her (and you) miserable for the entire day. It also gives her the whole day to try to talk to you about it or out of it. This is an option, though remember that you should not go through the motions of being into the relationship all day and then suddenly give her the news at the end of the day. This may be a good option if you are both working all day and don't have an opportunity to talk or see each other until the evening.  Rather than choosing Valentine’s day or night, think about both of your schedules to determine the best time of the day to break up. Considering what you both have on the agenda for the day will guide you in picking the best time of day to do it.  Unless you have absolutely no other choice, you should generally avoid breaking up via chat, text, email. It is impersonal and even a bit rude and disrespectful — especially if you have been together for some time. This is even more so the case on Valentine’s Day because of the romantic and sensitive nature of the day.Avoid romantic locations. You should also try to find somewhere that doesn’t hold any special meaning for the two of you.  Pick somewhere with privacy. Unless you have no other choice or you are trying to hurt or embarrass your partner, breaking up without an audience, especially on Valentine’s Day, is the best option.Places that may work include a community park, library, or any other public area that isn’t full of happy couples and big red hearts splashed throughout the landscape.  You want your soon-to-be ex to understand why you are breaking up on Valentine’s Day and also know that you mean business. Being honest with him about why you are ending it will hopefully help him accept the facts better and you won’t have extra explaining to do later.Although it may hurt him to have you say that you are leaving him for someone else, it’s better they find out from you than some other way.  For example, you could say, “It’s hard to me to admit this, but we’ve always been honest with each other. I’m breaking up with you because, over time, my feelings have changed.”  , Saying things you know will hurt the other person or causing a scene is not the best way to break up with someone, especially on Valentine's Day. Don’t be mean or take shots at the other person’s character or personality, but be sure the person understands that you are breaking up with her and why.For example, saying something like, “I’m leaving you because you are lazy, ignorant, and annoying” is mean and hurtful.  Instead, you might try saying, “I’m not happy in this relationship anymore, so I’m ending it. I don’t think we are compatible and don’t see a future for us.”  , During the break-up don’t allow the other person’s reaction sway your resolve. If you need to, recall why you wanted to break up with the other person and why you needed to do it on Valentine’s Day (and couldn't wait until another day). Be strong. Even though Valentine’s Day is not the best day to end a relationship, remember that breaking up will ultimately be what’s best for both of you and that in all likelihood, you're not the only couple breaking ties this holiday.  ","choose the right time. select an appropriate location. be honest. be respectful. maintain your resolve. "

"Stevia is an herb that acts as a natural sweetener. It is sugar and calorie free, and can be used in place of sugar. However, you have to use different doses. You can find stevia in most grocery stores.Make sure to choose an all natural stevia. Read the ingredients list and try to avoid stevias that contain dextrose, maltodextrin, erythritol, and inulin.  Honey is another way to sweeten your baked goods naturally. Honey can be very sweet, so you should use about ⅓ the amount of honey for the amount of sugar you’d use. However, you can’t use honey in a recipe where you need to beat butter and sugar together. This leads to denser baked goods.Many people believe honey is not a good substitute for sugar because it breaks down the same in the body, so you really aren’t improving anything. If you are concerned about this, you can try one of the other alternatives.  You can use honey with softer, moister cakes, breads, and pancakes., Maple syrup can be added to baked goods to sweeten them. Maple syrup has antioxidants, which adds benefits other than a limited sugar content for the baked good. You can’t use maple syrup in any recipe where you need to mix butter and sugar.You can use less maple syrup than sugar in recipes.  Maple syrup has less calories than honey, so it may be a better option.  Beets are naturally sweet, and they are used in making sugar substitutes. You can shred beets or use beet pulp in place of sugar in a recipe. Plus, beets add extra nutrients to any baked good. Try beets when making cakes or muffins.Many people add vanilla extract, vanilla powder, or unsweetened vanilla almond milk when baking with beets.  ","use stevia. try honey. add maple syrup. use beets. "
"You can make a gelatin face mask at home to remove unwanted facial hair. All you need is a tablespoon of unflavored gelatin, 2 to 3 tablespoons of milk, 3 to 4 drops of lime juice or 1 to 2 drops of lavender essential oil.  Mix the products together, then microwave them for about 15 seconds. Apply the mixture to your face, and let it sit for a few minutes. Then, peel it off.  Make sure you don't get the mixture near your eyebrows or eyes. When you peel the mask off, you should find that unwanted facial hair (and blackheads) come off with it.  Fruit-based scrubs can help you remove unwanted facial hair without the harshness of chemical products.  For the lemon/orange peel scrub, mix together 1 teaspoon each of powdered orange and lemon peel, ground almond, and oatmeal. Add 2 teaspoons of olive oil and 1 teaspoon of rose water. Mixing these items should create a paste. Put the paste on your face for about 5-8 minutes. Rub the paste into your skin with small circular movements. Then rinse your face with water. You will need to do this 2-3 times a week to see results.  For the apricot scrub, grind half a cup of dried apricots in a blender until it's a powder. Then add 1 teaspoon of honey. Apply to face for 5-10 minutes. Rub into skin with small circular movements, and then rinse with lukewarm water. You also need to use this scrub 2-3 times a week to see any difference.  Tumeric has been used for a long time in India to improve the look of the skin. You can make a homemade paste out of it. All you need is 1 to 2 teaspoons of Tumeric, and milk or water. Mix them into a paste. Put it on your face for 15 to 20 minutes. Let it dry. Then, wash it off with warm water.  This paste will work best for people with fine facial hair. If the hair is denser, you could add oatmeal to the paste.  Another natural remedy for removing facial hair can be made with eggs. You need 1 egg white, 1 tablespoon of sugar, and 1/2 tablespoon of cornflour.  Beat them together until it turns into a paste. Apply the paste to your face, and let it dry. It will turn into a thin mask.  Pull the mask off firmly, and you should see the hair come off with it.

"Before you can convince your man to get a cat, you need to be able to identify your reasons for wanting one in the first place. Think critically about why you want a cat, and ask yourself these questions:Why do you think a cat is the best option?  What is your experience with cats?  How long have you wanted a cat?  Why is now a good time to have a cat?  Will there be a better time to have a cat?;  , Many people thinking of getting a pet tend to romanticize what it will be like. It’s easy to imagine all the sweet and cuddly moments you hope to enjoy with a kitty, but you also need to be realistic and think about the drawbacks of owning a cat.If you are going to convince your man to get a cat, you need to make sure you are both prepared for the reality of owning one.  Animals can make a mess and cats are no different from other pets. At some point you will clean up cat poop, pee, and vomit.  Remember, you will have to clean out the litter box regularly.  It takes time and money to groom your cat and treat them for fleas and any illnesses that might develop.  Cats are great hunters. Are you going to be upset if your cat kills birds, mice, lizards, or bugs, and then brings it inside your house or apartment?  Cats have different personalities, and may not act the way you imagine they will.  Like any pet, cats require time, money, and energy to care for. Your man is more likely to agree to having a cat if you can show that you will be able to support and care for it.If you and your significant other go out of town frequently or work long hours, how will you ensure a cat is taken care of? Develop a plan so you are prepared to discuss it with your significant other.  Make a spreadsheet and total up the potential expenses of owning a cat. Factor in the cost of food, toys, litter, supplies, medication, and vet visits. Don’t forget to account for potential emergencies that require more expensive medical procedures.  If you know a vet in your area, you can call and ask them about the price of regular visits and medications.  Before you rush into a conversation with your significant other about getting a cat, think carefully about why they may be reluctant. While you will need to ask them directly how they feel about it, thinking about their potential concerns beforehand can make the conversation feel less confrontational.How does your man view cats, and how are cats viewed in his cultural background?  What does he know about cats?  Has he had other pets?  Is your man allergic to cats?  Would he prefer another kind of pet?  , Think about how the cat will fit in with the other members of your family.For example, how will a cat interact with other pets in your household?  Do you have children who might have trouble being gentle with a cat or are scared of animals?  Can your family make a long-term commitment to owning a cat. Cats typically live for 15 years or more.  Will your housing situation allow for a cat? Some apartments and rental homes do not permit cats.  It’s also a good idea to think about where you might get a cat before you discuss it with your significant other. Consider the options below, and think about what may be right for you, your man, and your family:Adopt a cat from a shelter or rescue agency. These cats are looking for great homes and are often more affordable upfront since they have been given shots, spayed or neutered, and have had initial vet care. At the same time, they may also have special needs or health issues.  Buy a cat from a reputable breeder. If you have a specific type of cat in mind or want a purebred cat, then look for a responsible breeder online or in your area. Breeders will be able to talk with you about the cat’s personality, needs, and the potential benefits of a specific breed.  Pet stores often sell cats, but look for one that works with a local shelter or rescue organization so you know the cats are healthy, well-socialized, and not from a kitten mill.  If you don’t broach the topic, you are going to have a hard time talking with your man about getting a cat.Be upfront about what you want and don’t try to manipulate your husband or boyfriend into getting a cat. Threatening to get a cat without their agreement or lying about the matter, may damage your relationship and make it more difficult for you to convince him why you should get a cat.  Since you’ve spent some time reflecting on why you want a cat and think it is a good fit, share your research and findings with your significant other. He will be impressed that you took the time to really consider the benefits, drawbacks, and reality of owning a cat.  Now that you’ve explained how you feel about getting a cat, it’s essential for you to listen to your significant other’s feelings and concerns. His feelings are just as important as yours, and he might bring up some points that you had not considered.In order to persuade someone, you need to acknowledge and address their misgivings.  Don’t interrupt him while he is talking. This won’t encourage him to communicate, and the conversation could become unpleasant and confrontational.  When you understand your significant other’s concerns or reluctance about getting a cat, you will be better equipped to address these concerns and come to a resolution on the subject together.For example, if your man has allergies, you could explore adopting a specific breed that produces fewer allergens than others. Here are a few of the breeds considered “hypoallergenic”: Siberian, Balinese, bengal, sphynx, Cornish rex, Devon rex, and siamese.If your significant other is worried about getting scratched, talk with him about trying to find a friendly cat or even working with a cat trainer to prevent problem behaviors., If your significant other hasn’t spent much time around cats or doesn’t care for them, you can educate them and discuss the great things about owning a cat. Here are a few things you can mention:Cats are cuddly.  Cats are independent.  Cats reduce anxiety and stress.  They bathe themselves.  They don’t require extensive potty training.  They can take care of the bug and rodent population around your home.  Cats spend much of their time sleeping.  Cats offer companionship.  Cats improve your health.  Cats teach you and your family responsibility.  Owning a cat can increase your bond with each other.  They can help people be less self absorbed.  If your man hasn’t spent much time around cats or is concerned about having one, it can be a good idea to spend some time together around cats. He might just need a good introduction to a nice cat, and this experience may change his perspective on getting a cat.Visit friends who have a cat, or offer to “cat-sit.”  Go to an animal shelter and play with some of the cats there.  Contact a rescue group and offer to help out together so you can spend time around the cats and learn about how to care for them.  To have a successful conversation about getting a cat, you and your significant other both need to be willing to compromise.For example, if he is open to the idea of getting a cat but would like to wait a little while, you could agree on a timetable.  If there’s another pet he would like, be willing to accommodate his desire in exchange for getting a cat.  Work together to pick a breed, sex, and name for your cat. You’ll both feel more invested if you make these decisions together.  If your significant other does not want to have a cat, he might be open to it if you are willing to be the cat’s primary caregiver. If his main objection to having a cat is the responsibility of taking care of it, this might be a good compromise.If he agrees to this, his feelings for the cat might change once they bond.  If your man is unwilling to compromise about having a cat in the home, you can still spend time with cats and help care for them. Consider volunteering at a shelter in your area.You’ll be helping cats that are in particular need of love, affection, and care.  If your significant other doesn’t want to make a long-term commitment to a cat, there are other options available. Work with animal rescue groups or cat-rescue agencies to provide a temporary foster home for a cat in need.Sometimes the agency or rescue group will be able to provide food and medical care, so it is not as much of a burden on your finances.  Fostering a cat is usually a short-term commitment until the agency or rescue group locates a permanent home.  If it doesn’t seem like owning a cat is a possibility at this time, you can still get your kitty fix and help out friends, family, and neighbors by being willing to take care of their cats when they are out of town or unavailable., Your partner might be opposed to getting a cat, but he may be open to adopting a different kind of pet. If you are looking for companionship, other animals can provide this too.Talk with your significant other about pets he might be willing to live with. Then, do some research online to learn about your options.  Make the decision together so you will both be on the same page and agree to take care of the pet.  ","identify why you want a cat. ask yourself if your expectations are realistic. make sure you have the time and money to care for a cat. think about why your significant other may not want a cat. be sure that a cat is the right pet for your family. know where you might get a cat. start discussing the possibility of getting a cat. listen to how your man feels about getting a cat. try to address any concerns. explain the benefits of having a cat. spend time around cats together. be willing to compromise. agree to be the one primarily responsible for the cat. consider volunteering at a shelter. look into fostering cats. offer to cat-sit for friends, family, and neighbors. research other pets.

"Minor wounds, like surface scrapes or shallow cuts, usually stop bleeding on their own after a few minutes. If necessary, cover the area with a clean cloth or bandage and apply gentle pressure. Elevate the wound if possible, so the area is held higher than the heart.For example, if you have an arm or leg injury, elevate the limb to hold the wound at a higher point than your heart.  Run warm water over a scrape or cut to remove debris and germs. Clean around the wound with a wash cloth and mild soap or saline solution. Start cleaning the wound as soon as possible to prevent infection.Soak a puncture wound for 15 minutes in a warm saline solution to flush debris.  If necessary, dip a pair of tweezers in alcohol to sanitize them, and use them to remove particles of debris from a scrape or cut that you can’t flush with water. Consult a doctor if you can’t remove any debris from a puncture wound or deep cut.  Use a cotton swab to cover the wound with a thin coating of antibiotic ointment. Dress the wound with a sterile bandage. If necessary, use a clean cloth to dry the area around the wound so the bandage can adhere.Be sure to change the dressing at least once a day or whenever it comes damp or dirty.  If the wound doesn’t become infected, just clean it with saline solution at least once daily or whenever you change the dressing.  As you care for your wound, make sure to check it often for signs of an infection and call your doctor if you notice any of these signs. These signs may include:  Redness  Swelling  Heat (increased temperature at the wound site)  Pain  Tenderness  Pus  ","stop the bleeding. flush a fresh wound for up to 10 minutes. apply an antibiotic ointment and dress the wound. check for signs of infection.

"For the beads, larger sized beads are best, especially to create the head; if you use seed beads for the body, you'll need quite a few more than using larger beads., More beads means more weight, so take this into account when working out how many beads to use for the body length.  This will be the 'tail' end of the dragonfly and will prevent the beads from sliding off.  You can use more or less beads depending on the size and type of beads you're using.  To do this:  Bend a small loop to the right first, then cross over the middle and bend a small loop to the left of the same size. This will form the two lower, smaller wings.  Continuing from the lower left wing, cross over and create a larger loop on the right hand side to make the upper right wing. Then bring the wire back and make a final large loop of the same size on the left side to create the large upper left wing.  Bring the end of the wire to the middle of the dragonfly wings and loop right around to create a wire knot.  Slide one large bead on to create the head of the dragonfly.  Don't close this circle; the earring hook needs to slip into it.  , The earrings are now ready to wear.  ","use medium gauge, lightweight wire to create this simple wire dragonfly. decide on the length of the earrings before proceeding. using pliers, twist the wire into a small circle loop at one end. assemble approximately 5 medium sized beads along the length of the wire so that they sit on the tail loop. create the wings. continuing with the same piece of wire, straighten it up again. finish off the piece by creating a small circle as you did at the beginning to form the loop for the hook and to prevent the head bead from falling off. repeat for the second earring. , add the earring hooks to each earring.

"Some people don't realize that people of a given religion can be of all sexualities, and vice versa, and a quick explanation is all they need  'I'm Jewish and pansexual. Sexuality and religion are two separate things.'  'I was raised Catholic, and I'm bisexual. I find that the doctrine of loving your neighbor certainly applies to LGBT people, so I'm comfortable with my religion.'  'Yes, gay people are everywhere, including Iran! I am Muslim and gay.'  , Some people might think that you are choosing your orientation because of your religion, or because you want to be counter-cultural.  'I didn't choose to be asexual any more than you chose to be straight. Just like you couldn't make yourself turn asexual, I can't change my own orientation.'  'Being bisexual isn't a choice—if it were, who would choose to get harassed or discriminated against?'  , Some people have a lot of questions or misconceptions, and you might not have the time or energy to explain it all.

"For long climbs that also involve some walking, including face chimneys, cracks, and slabs, you'll need to buy a sturdy conventional climbing shoe with a board last. This is a flexible board that's placed on top of the midsole to make the shoe more stable and rigid. This adds more stability and helps roll the foot up and along after each step. These are generally made of leather or a strong synthetic material, and fit more loosely than other types of climbing shoes to allow for thick climbing socks. This type of climbing shoe can also be used in combination with crampons to add extra traction when climbing in snow or over ice.  Sport climbing shoes are suited for light climbing gym activity at easy to moderate difficulty, but also for face climbing and very limited crack climbing. They are narrower, fit more snugly than the sturdy conventional climbing shoe, and are slip lasted. These climbing shoes are best for beginning rock climbers or those climbing on surfaces that don't require maximum precision of foot placement.  Performance climbing shoes are for advanced rock climbers and can be worn in a climbing gym or outdoors for competitions, overhangs, advanced sports routes, and bouldering. These shoes are typically turned down for maximum performance on overhangs. This style of shoe is not ideal for long multi-pitch climbing, as they are typically snug and can be uncomfortable when worn for long periods of time.;  , You'll need to try on a lot of shoes to find the right fit. It's best to ignore the sizes on the boxes as manufacturers can either use street shoe sizes or climbing shoe sizes, and the different designs affect the way the shoe fits to your foot. An important thing to remember is you don't have to downsize. try on many styles and models and try to find a shoe that is snug but also comfortable on your feet. Also remember some advanced shoes require a short to long break in period before you will be very comfortable in them.  When buying a conventional climbing shoe, make sure to allow enough room for thick climbing socks if you plan on climbing in colder weather. Many climbers chose not to wear socks in their shoes though. Also pay attention to how the shoe fits around your ankle, as this can sometimes chafe and make the whole experience painful. Leather climbing shoes might be more expensive than synthetic, but they're much more durable and offer better protection from the cold. Also note leather shoes can stretch up to a full size while synthetic shoes will not stretch very much. When buying leather, choosing a lined shoe is a good option as it will reduce stretching.  Sport climbing shoes should fit snugly without being painful. Remember to test the traction to see if they will offer you a good grip when climbing.  Performance climbing shoes should be a very tight fit. In fact, it's quite common for these shoes to be painful to wear. However, the tight fit also allows for maximum precision during foot placement, as well as maximum traction. Generally, climbing moccasins are a popular choice among advanced climbers. Make sure that your toes curl up in the front of the shoe and can't wiggle.  ","decide what type of climbing you will be doing and determine the type of climbing shoes you need. locate a sports goods store with a large selection of climbing shoes. buy a climbing shoe that gives you the desired amount of stability or flexibility in foot placement, provides adequate traction, and matches your budget.

"A good way to reward your dog for a job well done is by giving them a treat. Some good treats to use are bite size soft treats (from the pet store) or small pieces of meat.;  , Call his/her name and show them the treat.

Now that your dog knows how to sit, you can teach them the advanced version. Have your dog sit in a place where there are no distractions. Hold a treat in your hand and move your hand over your dog's nose. Your dog should lean back and lift its front paws off of the ground. Reward your dog and say 'sit pretty' Repeat until your dog sits pretty every time.  Now that your dog can sit pretty, it is time for your dog to master the trick. Have them sit pretty like usual, but this time see how long they can hold it for. If your dog is having a hard time balancing, try helping them by holding their paw.

"The average age of your class will determine your lesson plans and goals; very young children will not respond to certain challenges that older children may thrive with. For instance, children under a year old should simply become acquainted with playing in water rather than being forced to swim.Often, teachers get bored teaching fundamental skills and jump to something that interests them rather than that properly challenges the students. Be patient and mindful of your students' needs.  You may consider shadowing a more experienced swim teacher in order to observe how they react to different demographics of children. Contact a community gym, pool, or fitness center to see if this is an option.  Children will not be competent swimmers until the age of about six or seven, but skill-building in a classroom environment can begin before that age.Children between four and six years old can benefit from coordination and stabilization exercises in the water. These exercises will help them get used to the basics of moving in the water.  Water safety should also be a prioritized lesson at this age. Teach children not to run by water, to be careful on slippery surfaces, and follow a protocol when entering and exiting a pool.  Be patient. Children at this age are not learning disciplined form; they are learning how to interact with the water. Interest levels and prowess will change day-to-day at this age.  An ability to independently float in the water is a fundamental skill for swimming in general. Independent floating can be taught as an assisted wall float: with the student's back in the water, have them place their heels on the edge of the pool, anchoring them. Then, have the student extend their legs, flattening their body on the surface of the water and spreading their weight out to the length of their body. Once their legs are extended and their body is floating on the water, have them breathe normally and sustain the float for as long as possible.  It is best for them to not use their hands to assist their float. Once they master the assisted wall float, they should move on to try floating without any assistance.  This form of floating can help students get used to having their head and stomach underwater. Much like the assisted wall float, this exercise requires students to put their feet on the pool edge and extend their legs; this time, though, they will be floating on their stomach rather than on their back. Keeping hips and shoulders on the surface of the water, students must take a deep breath and put their face under the water. Students may use hands for the stomach float, but only to help bring the head up for another breath.  Assisted wall floats and stomach floating can be alternated as part of a drill or a game. Challenge students to be the one who can sustain a float the longest.  Students who know how to push off a wall to float will understand how to use momentum to move in water. While their feet are on the wall of the pool, have the student take a breath and push off the wall. This will propel them through the water. Have the student relax and feel their head, legs, and arms sink in the water as they lose momentum and finally stop. This will help them become accustomed to sinking in the water and correcting this with a float. You don't necessarily have to couple this with a lesson in strokes, but a wall push-off is a good exercise to pair with continued movement through the water.  You may want to conduct this exercise in the short end of the pool, so that inexperienced swimmers can stand up after they lose momentum.  Water noodles and floating boards are good tools to pair with this exercise, so inexperienced swimmers can experiment with using their legs and arms to continue movement through the water.  Often, the point of instructing young children is to instill discipline, self-awareness, self-esteem, and curiosity rather than build great technique. Empathize with your students and understand the challenges they are facing in trying something strange and new. Making their first experience with swimming a friendly, safe, and responsible one can lead to a lifelong interest in learning.  A safe environment can be established through instructional generosity. Sandwich 'corrections' with compliments, reward those who try new things, and keep in mind each child's fears or weaknesses.  At the same time, hold students responsible for their conduct, discipline, and effort. Make sure lesson plans are followed, even if altered.  ","teach age-appropriate skills. encourage the development of coordination. teach independent floating. teach stomach floating. teach wall push-offs. encourage the development of discipline. "
"The board should be at least an inch wider than your dogs normal stance. Use one with older ball bearings—you want your board to travel about a meter with each push.;  , Begin with putting your dog in a carpeted room with the skateboard. Place it flat on the ground, wheels up. Praise your dog extensively for any interest it shows in the skateboard. Make noises with the board by spinning the wheels or tapping the surface. Observe your dog's response. After a few minutes, put the board away. Let your dog rest for 20 minutes or so.  If your dog seemed fine with the board upside down, put it right side up this time. However, be sure to secure the board so that it doesn't roll around when your dog tries to play with it. Again, praise your dog for any interest in the board.  Observe your dog's reaction—any sign of fear and you should back up a step. Try not to roll the board directly towards your dog, as this can be seen as threatening. Instead, awaken your dog's predatory instincts by rolling the board away from it. Continue for a few minutes, then take a break. Repeat. Continue to the next step when your dog is comfortable around the skateboard.  If your dog tries to get on the skateboard at any point, be sure to give it lots of praise and/or treats. Don't forget to hold the skateboard steady.  Secure the board so that it can't move. Reward the dog the majority of the time that it shows any interest, but focus on interest involving one or more paws on the board. It's okay if your dog doesn't leave his paws on the board yet. Continue this until your dog puts a paw the on the skateboard whenever it's presented.  Reward the majority of the time that he puts a paw on the board, and always when two or more paws are put on the board.  If your dog begins to get so frustrated that he whines/barks or stops trying, put the skateboard away and try again later and/or back up a step.  Initially, your dog will probably move his feet as soon as the board starts rolling. Try to reward your dog with a treat in the moment before he gets off the skateboard. Put the treat directly in his mouth so that he dog doesn't have to move off the board to get it. Move on to the next step when your dog is comfortable keeping two paws on the moving board for at least 4 feet (1.2 m).  Reward your dog extensively for standing on the still board. Phase out rewards for merely being interested in the board, and only reward some of the time for two paws. Once your dog consistently stands on the board, you are ready to move on.  Be sure that you are holding the skateboard to keep it from shaking too much. Praise your dog for staying on the board.  Tap the board and say the desired command to get your dog to get up on it. Move slightly back from the skateboard so that your dog is required to push forward to get the treat. Reward your dog whenever he does something desirable.  ","find the right skateboard. introduce your dog to the skateboard. bring the board back down. roll the board around a little. begin training your dog to get on the skateboard. begin rewarding your dog only 1/2 the time he shows interest in the skateboard. move the skateboard forward a couple feet once your dog places his paws on it. place your dog so he is standing on the skateboard completely. roll the skateboard back and forth slowly. get your dog to mount the skateboard on his own. continue trying until your dog will obey the command without the need of a reward other than praise.

"Hardly anyone's ears are good enough to tune a piccolo. They are very accurate and last a long time.;  ,  Warm up and try to get your piccolo to the temperature it will be while you are playing it. If the piccolo becomes cold or warm its pitch will fluctuate.  Play your A in both octaves. Make slight adjustments according to the tuner. If you are flat, push in. If you are sharp, pull out.  A slightly unorthodox thing to do is tune to a lower octave D as well.  Try to adjust to where a straight tone, without pitch wavering, is heard. If there are flute players tune them with the piccolo players as well.  Piccolos are notorious for going out of tune, and the majority of the time they are flat. This doesn't hold true all of the time, but if you can hear that you are out of tune, especially in higher notes, lip the note up so it is sharper.

"It is recommended by firefighters that you mount smoke detectors high on the wall, or on the ceiling away from windows and exterior doors. (This is not the case for carbon monoxide alarms, about which, see #2, below.) Smoke fills up a room from the ceiling down, so having the detectors high should alert you early on. It is also recommended that detectors be placed at least 10 centimeter (3.9 in) / 4' from the wall when installed on the ceiling, and 10 centimeter (3.9 in) / 4' from the ceiling for wall installation.;  , When installing a carbon monoxide alarm, choose a location where the alarm will stay clean, and out of the way of children or pets.  It is important to install detectors near sleeping areas and on every level of your home. Also place a detector in hallways and a carbon monoxide detector near heating, such as gas furnaces. Avoid installing a smoke detector in the kitchen. Unless, of course, you want everyone to notice your lack of culinary skills! Also keep detectors one meter / 3.3 feet (1.0 m) from the doorways of steam emitting areas, such as the bathroom, laundry or kitchen.  Measure the distance between the mounting holes on the back of the mounting bracket.  Mark the same distance on your chosen location.  Drill small holes at the marks.  Attach the mounting bracket to the surface with the screws. See 'Tips' for seeking professional assistance.  Mount the rest of the detector into the bracket.  Routinely test your detectors. Push the test button to elicit a loud noise. If there is no noise, or a faint noise, you should check or change the batteries. For smoke detectors, you can also test the detector using simulated smoke. See How to Test a Smoke Detector.  A good way to remember is: Every time you change the clocks, change the batteries. Always test the unit after a battery change, to confirm that the batteries are properly installed and working.  This needs to be replenished over time, so be sure to check this as well as the batteries.  It's simple but it's an important step to take to help protect your loved ones and your home. To provide additional certainty on top of the detector, take a moment to develop a safety escape plan. Make sure that all the members of the family know this plan, know how they can escape and where they can all reassemble again once outside the house. Include special needs such as infants and the elderly when developing your plan.  ","choose your location. the diffusion of carbon monoxide in air is relatively even, meaning that a source of carbon monoxide can distribute the gas evenly throughout the room and house. place smoke detectors in the best places around the house. install the hardware. perform regular maintenance. try to change the batteries at least twice a year. note that carbon monoxide detectors have a chemical that helps in the detection process. rest a little easier.

"You can part it down the center of off to the side. This style works best with shoulder to collarbone-length hair.  Separate two thin sections of hair from your temples. Pull the rest of your hair back, then tie or clip it out of the way.  Braid the first section, then tie it off with a clear elastic. Braid the other section, and tie it off as well.When you are done, they will be sort of dangling by your face. If you'd like to, you can temporarily clip them out of the way.  Untie or unclip your hair. Split it down the center into two equal-sized sections, just like making two braids or pigtails.  Do not include the mini braids from the top of your head. Tie each back braid off with a clear elastic.If your hair is very thick, you may need to use a mini hair tie or regular hair tie instead. Be sure to use one that matches your hair color, however.  Take the left back braid. Pull it across the back of your head, towards your right ear. Secure it with bobby pins.  If your hair is very long, you may have to bring the braid back over to the left side of your hair, and secure it with more bobby pins.  Take the right back braid, and pull it across the back of your head, right above the first braid. Secure it with bobby pins. Tuck the end under itself, and secure it with some more bobby pins.  The right braid should hide the end of the left braid. If it doesn't, then tuck and pin the end of the left braid out of sight.

"There are four main options: PS4, XBOX, Wii U, or PC (computer). There are several pros and cons to each console; research all the information you can before you decide which to choose.  Consoles are a little expensive, so it's important to pick one that you can get the most enjoyment from.  ;  , There are several types of game genres, including first or third person shooters, RPGs (role playing games), TBG (turn based games) puzzle, fighting, action/adventure, racing, sports, etc. This is a small list. Again, spend some time researching the different genres to decide what you like. If you like a lot of fast paced action that will keep you on your toes, try shooters or action games. If you'd rather sit back, relax, and let a long story unfold, try RPGs. A lot of people are already familiar with the puzzle genre; Bejeweled and Zuma are just two of the many puzzle games.  You may also find you like more than just one genre.  You should buy two or three when getting the console. Of course, you can just buy one, but it's nice to have a few different games to switch out, in case you get bored, stuck, or mad at one game. If you buy used games, you can get two or three more games than the price of a brand new game. Also, try picking out games of different genres.  People who have been gaming for a while can skip this step if they want. However, if you're new to gaming, it's best to read the instruction manual fully. A lot of things will be thrown at you very quickly, but you'll pick up the basics in no time.  If the game has several difficulty settings, start at the lowest. You can always ratchet up the difficulty later if you think it's too easy.  The more you play video games, the more you will instinctively know in other games. For fighting games or any multiplayer games, you should practice a lot by yourself. Get used to the controls before playing against someone else.  Very often you will get stuck playing the same level or the same scenario. You'll lose over and over again. You'll convince yourself it's impossible. There might be profanity. Walk away, take a break, and come back to the game later.  Don't curse, use profanity, or insult other players.

"There are many different kinds of clay, any of which can create a dog. Deciding which clay to use depends on your desired end result.  Select your colors. You may choose to purchase different colors of clay to create the dog, or you can select to use one solid color and paint the dog after it is finished.  Some clays, like polymer, can be baked into a finished piece very quickly in an oven. If you don't have an oven to use for your clay, you may prefer to select an air-dry clay, however, you will have to wait four or five days to finish it. If you are doing clay animation, you will want to select an oil-based clay that will not dry out.;  , Instead of trying to mold a dog shape from a large chunk of clay, break apart the clay into several smaller pieces.  Keep one larger piece to create the torso of the dog.  Break off a piece for the head.  Make four pieces of equal size to create the legs. Roll the pieces into balls to try and keep the size as even as possible for each leg.  Make one smaller piece for the tail.  Set the remainder aside to use for other small shapes that remain, such as the ears and eyes.  Form a cylindrical shape with the largest piece of clay. Roll some clay into a ball and shape it into a rectangle. Round the edges a little to make the rectangular body look like a dog body.  You may want to adjust the torso to be smaller or larger depending on the kind of dog you want to create. For example, a basset hound or dachshund will have a much longer body, but much shorter limbs.  If you are making a large sculpture, you may want to crumple up damp newspaper and mold the clay around it. This will save you clay, make the sculpture lighter and save you time when baking., You can shape a single piece by forming a pointed snout at the front and rounding the back. Or, you can shape a separate ball of clay for the snout and press it to the front of the face. Stick it on the top of the end of the body.  To keep the head in place you might want to insert a toothpick halfway into the body of the dog. Then, place the head on the top half of the toothpick.  Flatten the bottoms and add pads with brown or black clay. Put two legs on the back of the dog, and two legs on the front.  Use the legs to help create the pose for your dog. You might want to make him stand, sit, or lie down. It is entirely up to you.  Roll another piece of clay between your hands to create the tail. You might want to make it long and pointy, or short and stubby. It depends entirely on the kind of dog you want to create. Attach the tail to the rear of the dog.  You will want to have ears, a snout, mouth, eyes, and a nose. You can use smaller pieces of clay to shape the pieces, or use your modeling tools to carve some of them into the existing form. The more time you take creating details, the more lifelike your dog will be.  Consider adding a tongue. Add a small piece of thin clay out the side of your dog's mouth.  Try pressing two small lines into each paw to create some toes.  If you are using different colors of clay you can give your dogs some spots by adding small, thin patches of different colors over the body or legs.  Create a collar by forming a long flat strip and wrapping it around the neck of the dog.  Check the instructions for your polymer clay to find the right temperature and time for the type of clay and the size of your clay dog.  Polymer clays will all cook at a temperature between 215°F (102°C) to 325°F (163°C)., Wait until the oven reaches the desired temperature. Place the tile with the dog on it on the middle rack of your oven.  Follow the cooking times suggested by the manufacturer for your type of clay. The larger your clay dog is, the longer it will take you to cook it in the oven.  Certain ovens use rapid heating systems that can create dips and spikes in the temperature. You should try to monitor the temperature in the oven to make sure your clay isn't getting too hot or not hot enough. Too cold and your clay may become brittle, too hot and you may end up burning the clay.  When the timer goes off take out your clay dog. Leave the dog to cool on the ceramic tile. Don't worry if the clay doesn't appear firm when you first remove it from the oven. As the clay cools down it will harden.  Use oven mitts when handling the tile. It will be hot.  You don't need to wash or sand your clay beforehand. Just brush on your base coat. Then add as much or little detail as you like.  Select the colors that suit your type of dog. You might use mainly brown and black for a rottweiler, or white and black for a dalmatian.  Avoid spray-on paints as they contain a solvent that can degrade your clay.  It may take 15-20 minutes to dry from the time you finish painting.  Use a different brush to apply the varnish. This will give your clay dog a nice glossy finish. The coat of varnish will seal in the paint and help protect it from chipping.  ","select your clay. break down the clay into manageable pieces. make the body. shape the head. roll out four identical cylinder shapes for the legs. make a tail. add some details. heat the oven. place the clay dog on a glass or ceramic tile. set a timer so you know when the time is up. use an oven thermometer. remove the dog from the oven. use acrylic paints. let the paint dry. brush on a coat of clear varnish.

"Especially if your pet eats fruit or veggies – or mammals, for that matter – keep these foods and the materials your use to prepare them away from your pet’s cage. Keep fruit in your kitchen, where you’ll be able to keep it fresh longer, and dispose of any fruit that you don’t refrigerate as soon as it shows signs of age.Be careful to remove and wash dishes with which you feed your pet a short time after feeding. This is somewhat dependent on the type of food you pet eats, but fruit in particular calls for cleaning later that same day.  Flies are out there, lurking in the wild just beyond the walls of your home, and waiting for a chance to enter. Stay diligent about keeping access points closed from disallowing the entrance of flies into you and pet’s domain. Alternatively, if you prefer to have windows and doors open, keep your pet in a room that will always be sealed from the exterior, at least via entirely undamaged screens.  In general, the cooler and drier you keep an indoor pet cage, the fewer flies you'll get. If it's especially warm in the room where you keep your pet, consider keeping the pet in a different room or doing what you can to cool the room where they live.  It’s a well-known fact that flies are attracted to garbage. Keep garbage receptacles in different rooms, to prevent flies that are attracted by garbage from occupying your pet’s tank as well. Relatedly, dispose of fruit in particular by either bringing it outside or putting it in a garbage disposal.

"One hundred percent organic essential oils are always the best option when purchasing essential oils. Aside from the environmental benefits of buying organic products, this will also ensure that you're getting an oil that came exclusively from a plant, without added artificial ingredients.  You will notice a price difference between 100% organic oils and those that contain synthetic chemicals. While organic options will be more expensive, the cheaper options are potentially dangerous to inhale.  Expect to pay around $10 for an ounce of some high quality essential oils, and up to $40 for others. You only use a few drops at a time, so one ounce (30 milliliter) jars can last you a while.;  , You can practice aromatherapy with essential oils via many different methods. One of the best ways to do so is with a diffuser designed for essential oils. The diffuser disperses steam produced by heating a mixture of water and essential oil.Steam allows the aroma of the oil to fill an entire room. Further, you may find the visual aspect of dispersing steam to be relaxing as well.  Diffusers can be purchased from around $20, with larger or more feature-laden models available for $40-$50. Find one at your local health supplies store or online.  Follow the directions on the model you purchase regarding the ratio of water to essential oil. You will likely only need to use a couple drops of essential oil in a full tank of water.  You can also steam a mixture of water and essential oil yourself. As one option, simply put a few drops of essential oil into a pot full of water and heat it on the stove. Set the burner to keep the water slowly simmering, and add water as needed.Alternatively, you can heat water on its own in your tea kettle. Once it boils, remove it from the burner and allow it to cool down enough to stop boiling, but remain steaming. Meanwhile, place ten to twenty drops of essential oil into a ceramic bowl. Fill the bowl about a third of the way with hot water. The steam will diffuse the oils into the room.  In both scenarios, too much heat risks destroying some of the properties in the oils that offer therapeutic benefits. Further, imperfect mixing of the oil and water may mean the aroma is faint relative to a electric diffuser.  Add a few drops of your chosen essential oil(s) to a warm bath top to make it even more relaxing. If you tend to take showers instead, add a drop or two of essential oil to a bottle of liquid soap (or directly to your loofa).Fill the tub with water before adding the essential oil. Make sure to mix well.  Some people also find that soaking their feet in a warm foot bath also helps them relax. Try it yourself, and add a drop or two of essential oil directly to the foot bath.  While the benefits of aromatherapy are well-established, they also have a time limit. An hour is a good benchmark for the maximum amount of time you want to spend in a space that smells prominently of an essential oil. Longer exposure times may actually lead to over-stimulation, which won’t help you de-stress.  ","use only high quality essential oils. use a diffuser. make aromatic steam yourself. include essential oils in your bath or shower. keep steam-based aromatherapy under an hour. "

"This is really the only part that the kids can't do, so you'll need to prepare this first.;  , Discard any corks that split during the drilling process.  This will be the head piece (the slit becomes the snake's mouth).  Painting is a messy job, especially when the kids muck in! Use newspaper, a tarpaulin, etc. to cover the painting zone.  Choose a suitable color for the snake––good colors include yellow, green, brown, black, red, etc. But your snake can be hot pink or neon orange if you want!  Allow to dry before assembling the cork snake.  This step is optional but adds to the interest of the snake. Patterns can include stripes, zig zags, spots/dots, diamonds, triangles, etc.  Again, allow to fully dry before assembling.  ,, Again, add another bead.  , Thread 4 to 6 beads onto the tail end to make the snake's tail. Knot firmly in place.  Don't pull too tightly though; allow some give so that the snake can twist and turn. There should be a good amount of elastic left at the head end, which will both hold the head and form the snake's tongue.  Thread two eye colored beads onto the pipe cleaner.  The cork should face the same way as all the other corks (that is, the long way, not sideways).  Let the overlapping part stick out over the end of the cork half to become the tongue. Wrap the pipe cleaner around the cork half in such a way as to have the beads sit at the sides, evenly. These are the snake's eyes. Cut off any excess pipe cleaner.  This completes the snake's head. Wrap a rubber band around the head to keep the cork halves together until the glue dries firmly.  Cut the elastic down to a length that is suitable for the snake's tongue.  Cut a V shape into the end of the elastic to mimic the forked tongue that snakes have.  Paint this end piece of elastic a good tongue color, such as red, pink or blue.  The snake is now ready for play. If you want it to last longer, varnish the whole snake and allow this to dry before playing.  ","drill holes directly down the center of each cork. brush away any cork dust and broken pieces. cut one cork in half. cover the workspace. paint all of the corks. paint patterns. thread the length of elastic through one of the corks with holes in its middle. , add a bead next. , thread the next cork onto the elastic length. continue in this way until all corks are threaded in place. , make the tail end. pull the elastic through the snake to draw together all of the corks and tail. make the eyes. place one half of the cut cork round side down under the extra piece of elastic at the head end of the snake. lay the elastic flat down on this cork half. glue the other cork half down on top of the cork half with the elastic on it. finish the tongue. done.

"It's best to have the conversation in person, especially if the guy is a friend. This way, you can make sure there's no confusion and address any questions he might have. Make sure you pick a solid time and place to talk.There is no good time to tell someone you're not interested, as the conversation will always be somewhat sad. However, you may not want to tell the guy right before a stressful work or school day. You may want to wait for, say, a weekend when he's not busy.  Pick a place that does not seem date-like. Going out to breakfast, for example, may feel like a date. Instead, you could tell him you want to talk to him and invite him to a non-romantic public place, like a low-key coffee shop.;  , While face-to-face is usually ideal, in some cases it's not the best idea. If the guy has been aggressively pursuing you and making you uncomfortable, send a text rejection. You can email him or text him you're not interested. This will save you from dealing with a potential outburst on his end.You should only do this if you feel the guy will get hostile. In most cases, it's best to talk face-to-face.  It can be nerve-racking to spill your feelings to someone, so spend some time thinking about your words. You can even write down your feelings and then read over your notes to try to figure out how to best phrase your feelings.Try practicing saying your words a few times before meeting up with him. This way, you can deliver the news in a calm, collected fashion.  You want to be direct, but not brutal. Make it clear you're not interested in him romantically, but that you still value him. Romantic rejection is always hard, so try to reject him kindly.Start off with a compliment that does not sound flirtatious. Say something, 'I do think you're a really nice person, but...' or 'I have fun hanging out with you, but...'  Then, quickly let the guy know you're not interested. For example, 'But I just don't see you as more than a friend. I'm sorry.'  You can give a reason if you want. For example, 'You're just not my type' or 'I think we would want different things out of a relationship.'  , Sometimes, there may be a specific reason you're rejecting someone. However, it's not always best to be brutally honest. If you don't know this person well, they're unlikely to change troublesome behaviors just because you ask them to and it may result in them getting hostile. For example, if you don't want to go on a second date with a guy because he talked too much, this information may not be worth sharing., If you were close before the guy developed feelings, you probably want to maintain that friendship. However, sometimes guys feel you will eventually come around if they stay friends with you. If you want to remain friends, make it very clear that you only want that.Say something like, 'I want to stay friends, but only friends. I don't want you harboring false hope I'm going to come around and see you romantically.'  If the guy does not seem to be getting the hint, you may have to lessen contact or become more casual friends.  At first, the guy may be hurt at the rejection. The two of you may want to reduce contact for a set period of time. This way, he can have time to cope with his feelings of rejection. Being around you too much after being rejected may make it hard for him to move on., Some guys may not take the hint. Even if you think you've been clear, you may find some men still ask you out or flirt with you. If necessary, remind them on occasion. Say something like, 'We talked about this. I just want to be friends.', If a guy does not leave you alone after you reject him, cut off contact. It's not appropriate to keep badgering someone for a romance if they've made it clear they're not interested. Stop returning texts and phone calls and get rid of him on social media., The sooner you tell a guy you're not interested, the better. If you sense a guy is interested in you, address as soon as possible. Letting it linger will only strengthen the guy's feelings, making the inevitable conversation more difficult., Some people prefer to simply gradually cut off contact from a guy. You may slowly stop returning texts and phone calls and hope the guy takes the hint. If you only met the guy recently, and only had a few dates, this technique is usually appropriate. However, when dealing with a friend who likes you, a more direct confrontation is important.  If you know the guy, or if he's part of your social circle, do not avoid the situation. If you know he has feelings for you, simply avoiding him can only last for so long. It's best to address the situation rather than avoiding it altogether.  ","choose a good time and place to talk. think about texting him if you're worried about a hostile reaction. plan what you want to say. be honest and direct. withhold some information, if necessary. be careful about being friends. lessen contact for awhile. repeat your rejection if necessary. ignore him if he keeps pressuring you for a romance. do not wait to tell him you're not interested. fade away only under certain circumstances. do not simply avoid him if you have the same social circle.

"If you have an expensive hairbrush made of wood, you don't want to completely soak it in water, or the wood could warp. Use a small amount of water as you scrub the brush, then wet a towel with water and wipe off the soap instead of running it under water.  If your hairbrush is wooden, don't take it in the shower with you.  If you do end up getting the brush wet with water, try to dry it off right away.

"If your boyfriend is cheating, he will become overly protective of his phone and computer. Does he get upset if you touch his phone or computer?His phone is probably what he uses to communicate with the other person he is seeing, and he wants to keep you as far away from his stuff as possible.  If you ask 'Who was that calling/texting you?' he may say, “nobody,” or “don’t worry about it.”  Does he delete text message threads or Facebook messages before he lets you use his phone?  Does he run to answer the phone before you can see who is calling?;  , If your boyfriend is cheating, he has to make time for this other person in his schedule and change his routine.You probably know his usual schedule.

Smelling differently (e.g. another person’s perfume or cologne)  Paying extra attention to his appearance (e.g. clothing, new haircut, going to the gym)  Lying about things that are both big and small.Saying different phrases that he usually would not.

"Start with the napkin in a square position. Fold it down so it meets the bottom right hand corner. Crease the fold with your hand, or a heavy object like a paperweight. Then turn the napkin around, so the fold is facing downwards., Take the left corner with your hand and fold it down. Do this until you have a straight edge running down the middle.

"Make sure the bags are big enough so that they'll put pressure on the shoe when they expand in the freezer.  When you seal the plastic bag up, remove any air from the inside of the bag. This will make it easier to 'mold' the water inside the bag to the contour of your shoe.  This method will involve placing your shoes in the freezer for an extended period of time, during which time they may get wet. Be sure that the shoes you are using with this method aren't irreplaceable or susceptible to water damage.  Make sure that the seal is tightly locked. You don't want your shoes covered in ice when you remove them from the freezer.  Your shoes should contain a smaller plastic bag inside the cavity and a larger one protecting it from outside moisture.  When the water inside the shoe freezes, it expands, putting pressure on the cavity in the shoe and breaking them in. The advantage of using water as opposed to a shoe stretcher is that the water will adjust to the contours of the inside of your shoe perfectly.  The water filled baggies should now be solid ice.  You may have to wait a few minutes in order to slide them out easier.  Once the shoes have warmed up a bit, try walking in them and even running and jogging in them if they are athletic shoes.  Your new shoes should now be broken in and even expanded a little, and a lot more comfortable!

"Join the spectators, and follow the player you suspect of cheating.;  , While you are following your suspect, open your console and type '/record' (to stop recording, enter '/stoprecord'). A good demo is at least five minutes long, but many streaming services require a longer demo for certain bans (for example, PBBans generally requires a ten minute demo for wallhacks). This will serve as evidence if somebody wants to appeal your ban.  This is most helpful if you suspect somebody is using wallhacks or chams. To take a PBSS, open your console, log into RCON (/rconpassword <password>), and type '/rcon pb_sv_plist'. You'll then see a list of all the players connected to your server. Take note of the player's slot number (the leftmost number). Then type '/rcon pb_sv_getss <slot number>. To review your PBSS's, go to the /game/pb/svss folder in your server using FTP. Taking good PBSSes will be discussed in the next section.  Below is a great example of a multihack that contains all of the most common hacks:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aG9uw3jFDmo&feature=related  Here's a brief description of the various hacks seen in this video:  Aimbot. An aimbot 'snaps' the player's aim from player to player automatically. The aimbot in this video would be referred to as 'full snap' because it moves from head to head instantly. A 'humanized' bot will move between targets more slowly and inaccurately.  Wallhack. A wallhack allows the player to see nearby players through walls. The server doesn't return the position of players on the whole map, so the effectiveness of a wallhack is limited to nearby players.  Chams. Chams are any kind of visual that could not be produced by the unchanged game itself. These include player information, enemy spawn timers, and rocket cameras.  Use the pb_sv_plist command and write down the last eight characters of the player's GUID. Go to the PBBans homepage and click on the MPi (if you have a PBBans account) or the MBi. Enter the GUID in the text entry field, then select 'GUID', 'Exact Match,' and the game name from the drop down menus. Check 'Show Linked GUIDs' and 'Alias Tracker.'

"We hint for the same reason we joke—to get the truth out in a way that the listener can choose to notice or ignore. This may sound a bit complicated, but it’s necessary. An important rule of gift giving is never to overtly expect a gift. If you’re not expecting a gift, how can you tell the giver what you want? You do it with a hint. When you hint, remember your goal is to help a bewildered giver, not to come out of the occasion at a net gain. So, as always, be considerate. Imagine yourself in the other person’s situation and consider what the person is likely able to afford in time and cost.;  , The best hint-givers involve you in the conversation. They may get you to answer a question or give you a little story with the hint just to cement it in your mind.  Do you remember learning about the subjunctive mood in high school grammar? It’s a great form for a hint.  (1) Good hint giver: “If I were to start really equipping my kitchen, the first thing I would buy is this pizza cutter.” (2) Great hint giver: “If I were to start really equipping my kitchen, I know the first thing I would buy.” The listener then has to ask, What is that? “This pizza cutter. Remember when everyone came over for pizza and I had to cut it with kitchen shears? I think maybe this would work a little better.”  , Sometimes historical hints are the easiest to come up with.  (1) Good hint giver: “My friend got me a really fun book here once. I pretty much love anything that comes from this store.” (2) Great hint giver: “My friend gave me something so fun from this store once.” The listener then has to ask, What was it? “It was an art print book. I pretty much love anything that comes from this store. And they always have a sales rack in the back. I’m always so tempted because I want to take home every last thing on the rack.”  (1) Good hint giver: “I love that we went out last Valentine's Day. It just doesn’t feel like Valentine's day unless we get out of the house.” (2) Great hint giver: “Do you remember what you gave me last Valentine's day?” The listener then has to rack his memory. “Really, the best gift was us going out together. Remember our walk after dinner? It just doesn’t feel like Valentine's day to me unless we get out of the house.”  , Some items are best not given as gifts, like clothing, home decorations, or project gifts. Therefore, if you trust the giver to choose any of these forbidden items, it is your job, nay your duty, to hint that you would appreciate such an item. You too should avoid giving any of these forbidden gifts unless you’re given a specific hint. Another time to do your hinting duty is when you find yourself in a position to drop a hint on someone else’s behalf. For example, if you are about to watch your dad buy a gift for your mother that you are sure she won’t like, go ahead and drop a hint on her behalf.  Timing is important, especially if the hopeful giver is not good at picking up hints. So drop your helpful ideas a week or so before you think the giver will be searching for your gift. Otherwise you risk your hint going unnoticed.  You can hint right after receiving a gift if you can do it without sounding ungrateful. This requires delicacy. First mind your manners and show some delight when you open the gift. Then thank the giver. Only then can you drop your hint. It’s best to make the hint a statement of gratitude: “What a perfect way to finish off my mug collection. I don’t think I’ll ever have to worry about getting another mug.”  ","remember the purpose of a hint. make sure the person is listening. drop a hypothetical hint. drop a historical hint. do your hinting duty. remember timing. hint when you receive a gift.

If you have a friend who is also learning English, make of point of studying together. Even if they are more advanced, you can learn a lot from a peer who already went through experiences and struggles that you’re having.  Languages can be challenging to learn. Having the comradery of a friend to join you in the learning process can help even if you don’t formally work on coursework or materials together.  Simply maintaining a basic conversation with a friend is one of the best ways to study a new language.  If you’re in a class together, check each other’s homework. Not only will this improve your scores, it will also improve your comprehension.  Quiz each other. Even if you’re studying different specific material, you can help one another with flash cards, and pick up new knowledge as you do so.  Having quick access to someone who may be able to answer questions will speed up your studying and make it more enjoyable. Sooner than later, they’ll have questions for you too!  , English arguably has the most words of any language, which means that there are often multiple words that give almost the same meaning. Even if a word is a synonym for another word, that does not mean the two words are interchangeable. Subtle differences in word meanings can make a big difference when you use the words.  For example, the words emaciated and thin have similar meanings, but you would not use them interchangeably. Emaciated indicates that someone looks so thin that she seems unhealthy, while slim implies that one looks thin, yet still attractive and healthy.Check the definition of synonyms before you decide to use them. This will help you to deepen your understanding of the English language while expanding your vocabulary as well.  Inconsistent ways of spelling certain sounds can make learning English a bit frustrating. When you’re having trouble with a certain word, look at how it's spelled in other forms. This may even frustrate you further for a moment – but it will remind you that there are plenty of exceptions to English spelling rules, and you need to recognize this to master English.  For example, some words feature silent letters, such as 'knife' and 'honor.”There are also rules for vowel order in some cases, such as “i” before “e” most of the time- (but not always!) and replace the “y” and add “ies” for plural words.  Verbs can also be challenging when you are trying to learn English. There are many verbs in the English language that have similar meanings, but the meaning of a sentence can be quite different depending on the one you choose.For example, “May I?” and “Can I?” have different (yet similar) meanings. “May” indicates that you are politely asking permission to do something, while “can” indicates that you are inquiring about whether or not something is possible.  Make sure that you familiarize yourself with common verbs to avoid making these types of mistakes.  In spoken English, many words are not pronounced the same way even if they are spelled the same way. This means that you may end up making some mistakes with pronunciation now and then.  For example, the words “bough,” “tough,” and “cough” all end in the same four letters, but each word is pronounced differently.

"The three most common types of flat screen TVs are Plasma, LED, and LCD. These types are explained as follows:  Plasma TVs create a picture by sending an electrical charge that is applied to a small sheet of tiny plasma cells.  LCD TVs are composed of liquid crystal compressed between two glass plates and backed by a fluorescent lamp. When you apply an electrical charge to the crystal, an image is created.  LED TVs are LCD panels, but instead of using the fluorescent (CCFL) backlight lamp, they use an LED backlight.;  , Contrast ratio describes your TV’s ability to display bright and dark images at the same time. The higher the contrast ratio, the better the picture quality will appear. If your TV has a poor contrast ratio, you'll lose detail in extremely bright and extremely dark scenes. While this isn't usually a huge deal, it can be a factor in making your decision. Generally, plasma televisions have the best contrast ratios. Backlit LED televisions come in close second. Edge-lit LED televisions and LCD televisions will have slightly lower contrast ratios.  Most LCD screens start at a contrast ratio of about 600:1, while plasma screens start at 1,000:1. Both types can reach up to 10,000:1. However, because there is no standard measure for contrast ratio exists at this time, manufacturers tend to exaggerate the actual output of their TV models. Consult product reviews for additional assessments.  In addition to higher contrast ratios, look for good image quality on black colors. While brightness can be adjusted, many LCD screens have difficulty creating deep blacks, which can result in a picture that appears faded.  If you watch a lot of fast-paced sports, a plasma TV may be your best bet, since they show the smoothest motion. However, LCD and LED TVs have improved greatly in this field in the last five years, and are both relatively good at showing motion.  Note that plasma TVs run the risk of being permanently damaged by 'static images,' such as network logos or status controls on video games. These images present a high risk of burn-in that permanently alters the screen.  LCD televisions usually only require a single fluorescent backlight, whereas plasma TVs require every sub-pixel to be lit individually. Generally, it will cost about 50 percent more to run a plasma television for a year than an LCD television. LED screens use the least amount of power. They use about 40 percent less energy than an LCD TV.  While none of these televisions have particularly short lifespans, the plasma screen has the shortest half-life—60,000 hours (in other words, it will take 33 years for the TV's brightness to be half a new TV's brightness if used for 5 hours a day). LED televisions generally have a half-life of over 100,000 hours. LCDs fall somewhere between the two.  Generally, LCD screens are the most affordable options (they may be your only option for smaller screen sizes). Plasma TVs are generally only available as larger screens and are slightly more expensive than their LCD counterparts. LED screens are the newest TV technology and are much more expensive. LED screens are also more difficult to find in stores.  ","understand the difference between types of tvs. compare contrast ratios. consider how well each tv type handles fast motion. think about power. consider the television's lifespan. consider price.

"Bring a pot of water to boil. You'll want to use water that's around 205 degrees for brewing your coffee. Be sure to use clean, filtered water for the best taste.Either use a kettle that has a long thin spout or carefully transfer the water to a pouring kettle with a long thin spout. Take care not to burn yourself when handling boiling water.  Unfold your paper filter and place it so that it fits the single cup brewer that you set over your coffee mug. Pour a little hot water over the filter so that it's completely soaked. Carefully, pour out and discard the soaking liquid.There are a variety of single cup cone brewers available. These include Kalita, Bee House, Clever Dripper, and Hario V60. The brewer will sit atop the serving mug so the coffee filters directly down and into your mug.  Weigh out 24 grams or about 2 tablespoons of ground coffee for your pour over brewer. Always use medium-coarse grounds. Using the right grounds will create the right extraction for the time you're brewing. For example, using a larger surface area (coarse grounds) requires longer brewing time than fine grounds that only need a quick extraction.If you can, grind your beans just before using them. Fresher beans will make a better tasting pot of coffee. If you need to buy pre-ground coffee, just take care to store it in an air-tight container out of direct sunlight and use it within a week.  Place the grounds in the pre-moistened filter that should still be in the top of your pour over brewer. You should also have a digital timer or clock ready before you start brewing.  You'll use about 400 grams of water which will yield one large cup of coffee., Start the digital timer or look at the clock to keep track of when you start brewing. Slowly pour about 1/4 of a cup or 50 grams of the hot water over the grounds in the filter. Gently stir the grounds and water (known as a slurry) with a spoon or chopstick.  Stirring can break up any clumps of coffee grounds and make sure the grounds are completely saturated., Once your grounds are saturated, wait for 30 seconds. This allows the coffee grounds to bloom. Slowly, pour more water over the grounds so the filter is always half-full of water.You should use a circular wiggling motion when pouring the water over the grounds. This can help mix the coffee and water together.  The water will slowly filter through the grounds and the paper, into the bottom of the pour over brewer. You don't need to stir the coffee, just let it filter down. Remove the filter and drink your coffee.  This entire process should take a total of 2 1/2 to 3 minutes from the time you started brewing.  ","boil water. preheat the pour over and filter. measure your coffee. prepare the pour over brewer. saturate the grounds. wait and pour water over the grounds. let the coffee brew. "
"The automatic watch is built with an oscillating metal weight, or rotor, that tracks movement. The oscillating rotor is attached to gears inside the watch that are in turn attached to the mainspring. When the rotor moves, it moves the gears which, in turn, winds the mainspring. This stores energy in the mainspring so that the watch continues ticking. If the watch is not being moved in regular, everyday motion, the mainspring’s energy winds down. If you wear your watch and keep your arm in regular movement, this should be enough to keep the rotor moving and winding up the mainspring. This doesn’t mean, however, that your arm needs to be in constant motion. Automatic watches are built to respond to average, everyday movement in order to keep them working.Typically, automatic watches store energy for up to 48 hours so that they continue working without needing additional winding.  People who are not very active, such as elderly people or those confined to bed, may need to wind their automatic watches with more frequency. If you are sick and laid up in bed, your watch may wind down since it’s not getting regular everyday movement.Avoid wearing watch when playing sports that require continuous hand or arm movement, such as tennis, squash or basketball. This will interfere with the automatic winding mechanisms, which are built for regular, everyday arm movement.;  , While an automatic watch is intended to restore its energy by the rotor winding the mainspring through the motion of your arm, it does also require periodic manual winding to keep the mainspring tight. In order to ensure that the crown is not overly strained when you pull it out and wind it, you should take it off your wrist. Then you will be able to have the right leverage and angle to carefully pull the crown out., The crown is the little dial knob usually on the right side of the watch. This knob can be pulled out to set the time and date on the watch. It does not need to be pulled out, however, in order to engage the winding mechanism. The crown usually has three positions or settings that engage certain functions. The first position is when it is pushed all the way in and the watch operates normally. The second position is when the crown is pulled out halfway; this is the position for setting the time or date (depending on your watch). The third position is when the crown is pulled out all the way; this is the position for setting the time or date (depending on your watch).If the watch is waterproof, the crown may be screwed down to provide added waterproofing. You may need to unscrew this crown by turning carefully 4 to 5 times. When you wind the watch, you will push down on the crown at the same time, which will screw it back into place. , Gripping the crown with your forefinger and thumb, twist it gently in a clockwise manner (moving it from bottom to top towards the 12 on the watch face if you are looking directly at the watch). Turn it approximately 30-40 times or until the second hand starts moving in order to fully wind the watch.Winding keeps the mainspring tight and at full energy reserve, which is also supplemented by keeping your watch in motion.  Contrary to popular belief, you cannot typically over-wind an automatic watch. Modern automatic watches are constructed to protect against this possibility.You should still be very gentle when turning the crown and stop winding when you feel resistance.  When winding your watch, you may accidentally move the watch hands if you pull the crown out at all. If this happens, reset the time by moving the watch hands forward in time to reach the correct time again. Your watch is built to move its hands forward, not backward, so it is better to keep the gears and interior mechanisms working in their intended manner., Gently push on the crown to ensure that it is pushed all the way back in. If you have a waterproof watch, you may need to double check to make sure that the crown has been screwed into place. Pinch the crown with your forefinger and thumb and tighten it while pushing it in.  If your watch has been properly wound, it should keep time that is consistent with other timepieces. If you think the watch is still not performing up to standard, you might ask a watch repair shop to test your watch on a timing machine. This instrument will measure its timekeeping and speed in order to determine if it is slow or fast., Automatic watches rely upon motion to keep working, and they may run down if they have been sitting in their box or in a drawer for more than a few days. Turning the crown on a watch 30-40 times will wind it fully and ensure it is ready to wear. Turn the crown until the second hand starts moving so you know that the watch has started keeping time. You will also likely need to reset the time and date.  ","keep your arm moving. take the watch off your wrist. locate the crown. turn the crown clockwise. always set the time by moving forward. make sure the crown is pushed all the way in. compare your watch’s timekeeping with another watch. wind the watch fully if it hasn’t been worn in a while.

"People who maintain a healthy weight maintain healthy glucose levels, which then help to regenerate tissues. A physical trainer in a gym or a general practitioner can come up with an exercise routine to help you obtain a healthy weight.;  , Aerobic exercise has been shown to increase the hippocampus, which in turn increases spatial memory. Aerobic exercise can include walking, cycling, running, flow yoga, swimming and more.  The number of heartbeats per minute to achieve aerobic activity changes with age, but is generally listed as exercise that increases your heart rate but still allows you to keep up a light conversation.  Understand that the longer that you maintain an aerobic exercise routine in your life, the easier it will be to maintain a good memory. However, it is never too late to start. People between the ages of 55 and 88 have been shown to diminish the likelihood of dementia by starting an aerobic exercise routine.  Breaking away from the same pattern helps exercise the brain and allows it to make new memories. Your intelligence increases as you form new memories.  The act of throwing the ball and focusing on catching it helps to improve hand-eye coordination. Try this combination of exercise and hand-eye coordination by playing catch, baseball, squash, racquetball, football, basketball, tennis, badminton or ping pong.  Use your weaker hand to play catch. Using a subordinate hand will help to increase the use of neurons. It helps to increase brain power and will have long-term positive effects on brain function.  Scientists believe that walking on rocky or uneven surfaces can help the vestibular system, which helps with balance. This connects with the brain's ability to remember and cope with obstacles.  Straying away from your comfort zone will increase concentration, allowing you to remember and stay focused for longer. Also, stray from your comfort zone with hobbies, conversations and intellectual pursuits to increase your memory.  Doctors suggest you get at least 150 minutes of aerobic activity per week, or 30 minutes of aerobic activity 5 days per week. Increase your workouts to 40 minutes or do them 6 to 7 days per week.  ","have a physical fitness examination to find out if you are overweight. create a weekly aerobic exercise routine. aerobic exercise is the amount of physical activity where your body can produce enough oxygen to allow you to work your heart. do several aerobic exercise activities per week, or walk on different paths. learn to juggle or play ball with friends and family. walk or hike on uneven ground. increase your physical activity as you get into shape.

"The home office deduction is one of the most common deductions for a filer to claim. It allows the filer to take the proportion of the house devoted to the office, subtract that portion from rent or mortgage payment, and deduct that from their income. So if your office took up half of your house, you could deduct half of your house payment from your income. But it easily raises suspicion, because it can call into question and cast doubt on many other aspects of a return. For example, say the house payment is $500/month and the filer has claimed four dependent children. On top of his children, he claims half of the house as an office. Since $500/month is a really low amount for a mortgage, an IRS agent will assume it’s a small house, and if it’s a small house, then where are all these kids staying—in the office? But then it isn’t an office, it’s a bedroom with file cabinets. If the filer needs that much office space, and he doesn’t he seem to make much money from office-related work, he could be underreporting that income.  It’s also common for people to claim mileage in a car as a business expense. It’s a permissible deduction, but also one that’s easily open to abuse, so it’s scrutinized pretty carefully. To satisfy any suspicions, put a mileage log in the car and update it every time you take a trip.For instance, if the “business vehicle” is the person’s only vehicle, it’s really hard to tell when business stops and pleasure begins, so they’ll want to investigate it—which can trigger an audit.  When travel, entertainment, and meals are for business purposes, they are deductible, but this is another area which is open to abuse, and therefore scrutinized heavily. If you claim more than $1000 per year in entertainment, you need to be very diligent about keeping track of the receipts and records. , The IRS actually has statistical models of charitable giving divided up into income brackets, so they would know about how much a typical single man making $40,000 per year would donate to charity. So if you donate much more than your usual amount, or much more than the amount a typical person of your situation would give, that’s going to invite a closer look.In order to protect yourself, make sure you make your charitable contributions via check and not cash.  If you claim more than a third of your income in itemized deductions, be prepared for an audit. It's an IRS red flag. Very few people could legitimately claim that amount of deductions, but even if they were all legitimate, it indicates a great degree of calculation on the part of the tax preparer. The level of calculation that allows a person to claim half of their income in itemized deductions invites suspicion.  ","keep your home office in good working order. buy a mileage log and keep it in your car. be conservative about meal and entertainment deductions. make your charitable contributions by check. don’t go overboard with itemized deductions.

"No one can plan for every potential problem that might arise.The important thing is that you understand that you have the ability to problem solve in the moment. Part of this is accepting that problems will arise. Going with the flow is having the confidence that you'll be able to handle the unexpected.  A presentation at work that relies heavily on Powerpoint might get derailed because the projector breaks down or a file won't open.  A person planning a party might have a good idea of how many people are going to show up, but must also be prepared for that number to be more or less than anticipated and adjust accordingly in the moment.  A teacher with a well thought out lesson plan must always be ready to answer questions they did not anticipate.  Don't be afraid to ask for help if you find yourself in a situation where you don't know how to proceed. For example you might ask if anyone in the meeting knows how to fix the projector. Or you might see if anyone at the party wouldn’t mind running out for more snacks if you find that you are running low.  See the humor in a situation that has turned out completely different than you expected. Say you wore a suit to a party where everyone else is dressed much more casually. This can be embarrassing, but a person who knows how to go with the flow understands that it is also not the end of the world. Using humor can lighten a stressful situation. 'I'm just trying to class this place up.' 'I have a movie premier to get to after the party.';  , Going with the flow means sometimes giving up control, not only of the situation, but of other people. A situation might become more stressful because of the behavior of another person. Perhaps someone is late to a dinner outing and you have to wait for them to arrive before ordering. You may be at a party where someone is monopolizing the conversation, which is leading you to become frustrated. Remember that in situations like this you can’t control someone else, but you can control your own actions.Try to empathize with the other person. Why might they be acting the way they are acting?  Give them the benefit of the doubt. Most people are just trying to do their best to be happy. The person might not know that their behavior is being perceived as disruptive.  Walk or drive a new way home from work without planning it ahead of time. Go to a new place for lunch. Order something you’re not sure you will like. Start a conversation with someone at school or at work that you don’t know very well. The more comfortable you get at putting yourself in situations that are unpredictable, the more easily you will be able to go with the flow no matter where you are.  We may set up an idea of how we want things to go, but rarely do they work out exactly that way. Striving for perfection is striving for something that does not exist.You don't need to completely let go of your goals for a project or outing, just be sure to make room for the fact that things don't always happen precisely the way you would like them to.  Focus more on the experience than the outcome. Whether you are cooking a new meal for the first time or attending a dance class, expecting that you’ll get it perfect the first time is only going to distract you from the joy of learning how to do something new. Instead, focus on the method and the joy of each moment, rather than obsessing about the outcome.  Avoid seeing yourself as a set of accomplishments. The things we achieve in life can give us confidence and make us feel good, but it becomes dangerous when we lean too much on them for all our happiness. Think about the other things that give you joy like a sport you play, a hobby you have, or a friendship or relationship you cherish.  Putting things into perspective can be a great tool for helping you go with the flow. When you find yourself in a situation where a loss of control is becoming stressful, take a step back and ask yourself what the actual consequences will be if things don’t work out the way you originally wanted them too.  If you and some friends planned on seeing a movie only to discover it is sold out when you get to the theater, what is the harm of agreeing to see something else that you may not be as excited about? There is always the possibility that you might like the movie even if you don’t think you will and even if you don’t, you’ll still get to hangout with your friends.  Being surprised can be one of the best parts of life. When you are struggling to go with the flow, ask yourself what new things you may learn or experience by letting go of control.Embracing a last minute change of plans can be rewarding. The restaurant you planned to go to is too crowded? Great! This may force you to try a place you would have never gone to otherwise.  Your favorite seat in the lunchroom is taken? Look at this as an opportunity to sit next to someone you don’t know very well and get to know them better.  Maybe your boss gives you an assignment you weren’t expecting. This is a great opportunity to expand your role at work and to show how adaptable you can be.  It can be difficult to go with the flow if you are feeling overwhelmed or anxious. Practicing some deep breathing techniques can help settle your nerves and clear your mind. Try shifting your focus to your breathing for a few minutes. Count your breaths up to seven and then back down again. Do this several times until you start to feel calm again., Dwelling on things you could have or should have done in the past will only make it more difficult for you to enjoy what is actually happening in your present. Accept that what is happening in this moment is your reality and that beating yourself or spending your time searching for someone to blame is not going to change anything. Instead, focus on what feels good about the moment. “I’m still able to spend time with my family, even though the Thanksgiving turkey is burned.”  Remember that you may not be able to change your surroundings or your situation, but you do have control over how you react to them., Maybe you taught a class where you feel like the lesson wasn’t communicated as efficiently as it could have been. Remember that you’ve also taught other successful classes and that you still have the ability to learn and grow.  Avoid “if only” statements.If you catch yourself saying things like “If only I had stayed at home,” or “If only I had planned my night more thoroughly,” stop yourself immediately. This type of thinking will only pull you out of the moment and make you feel worse.  Keeping a journal is a really helpful way to keep track of situations where it might be difficult for you to go with the flow. Write down what it is about those moments when you feel like you need to be in control and what makes those moments so difficult for you. You can also write down times when you found going with the flow to be easier than usual. What is similar or different about those moments?, Be open to the idea that someone else can take control of the situation if need be, and that they might be able to do just as good a job as you when it comes to leading everyone through something like rain on a wedding day, a lost dinner reservation, or a boring board game night. This will not only help you feel like you can more easily go with the flow, it will take some of the pressure off of you. Don’t make yourself responsible for every decision that needs to be made. Let someone else choose where to go dancing on Saturday night and be okay with whatever comes of it.  If you are working on a group project be sure to get input from everyone involved. Don’t put yourself in charge, or allow yourself to be put in charge, of all the different parts of a project. Listening to other’s ideas will make the project seem more manageable and allow you to let go of some control., Try putting some effort into helping others have a good time. Sometimes bringing the focus off of yourself can be a great distraction when you are having trouble going with the flow. Putting your focus on someone else will also help you stay present in the moment rather than sinking back into regret or guilt.Engage them in conversation. Ask them to join your team on board game night. Offer to dance with them or get them a drink.  Be confident and clear about how you feel about a change in plans or idea. As long as you are open to what others have to say, your contribution will come off as helpful and you may be able to compromise with your friends. Think about a night out as a collaborative effort.  “I think seeing the movie after dinner is a good idea, but I’m worried we might feel rushed to finish our meal in order to get there on time. Perhaps we should see an earlier show and eat after? Or see the midnight showing and just get drinks in between? What do you guys think?”  “I’m fine finishing up the spreadsheets but I don’t think I will be able to give them the attention they deserve if I’m also responsible for assembling the materials for the meeting. Could we split that task up among the group?”  ","realize that you can’t control everything. accept that you can’t control others. practice exposing yourself to the unknown.try doing a small unpredictable thing each day. let go of the idea that things need to be perfect.things are never going to be perfect. look at the big picture.overall, will going along with a change of plans have any long term effects on your happiness?, think about what you have to gain by going with the flow. breathe. live in the moment. try to focus on the positives.if you are stuck brooding over things that have gone wrong try to shift your thinking to focus on the things that have gone right or that you have done well so far.maybe your presentation at work didn’t go quite the way you expected, but you can still focus on the work you’ve done for the project overall. keep a journal. trust that other people’s ideas can be as good as yours. focus on someone other than yourself. express your concerns.

"There are many, many office suite programs available, and not all of them cost money. In fact, some of the best suites for home, student, or small business use are free. Although they aren't usually quite as full-featured or always as stable as Microsoft Office, they're all more than capable enough for the average user who just needs to be able to type a business report or term paper.  OpenOffice is probably the most talked-about and most popular free office suite available. It's an open-source program, which means that anyone with some programming skill can contribute to it. OpenOffice's Writer word processor handles Word documents with ease, and can even export its own files as Word documents.  LibreOffice is an outgrowth of OpenOffice that natively supports Microsoft's Open XML protocol (whereas OpenOffice requires a free plug-in to handle it). It's fairly new, but powerful and well-regarded. Most of OpenOffice's development team now develops for LibreOffice instead.  IBM Lotus Symphony was developed by IBM using OpenOffice as a starting point. It's sleek and fast, and can do almost everything OpenOffice can do.  In addition to traditional software packages you can download and use offline, there are a number of powerful word processing and office options available for use online, some of which are free. The advantage of these is that your work is always wherever you need it to be.  Microsoft's own OneDrive cloud storage actually has a free, full version of Office for personal use available entirely online. You can type, format, save to your hard drive, and even print documents from OneDrive's Word Web App. The only restriction is that you can't use it for a group – not even a very small group like a family business.

The reason behind these two different designs can be found by examining the braking sequence:  When you actuate the brakes of your vehicle, the disc brake pads or brake shoes have to slow down the brake rotors or drums mounted between tire rims and the suspension. The friction of the disc pads squeezing the rotors or pushing the brake shoes outward on the drums in order to slow the vehicle down causes the disk pads or shoes to get really hot.  On long downhill runs, there is a lot more stress placed on the front brakes (and therefore the front brake pads) than on the back brakes. For this reason, a superior braking method is required for the front brakes in order to handle this extra stress.  As mentioned above, the disc brakes located at the front of the vehicle are required to handle more stress than the drum brakes at the rear of the vehicle. As a result, they need to be of a higher quality.  Disc brakes were developed by race car and aircraft designers who wanted to find the best way of slowing down the machine without burning up the brake shoes. They were later introduced to the front axles of commercial vehicles in order to reduce the wear-and-tear on the front brakes.  The rear axle, on the other hand, doesn't have nearly as much force on it during braking, and since brake drums are cheaper and easier to manufacture, these are the more common form of brakes on the rear of most passenger cars and trucks.  However, more modern performance cars and heavy duty trucks usually have disc brakes on both axles (front and rear) because of their superior braking capacity. Disc brakes handle heat a bit better than drum brakes too, which means they still work well when they’re hot. Any braking system can develop fading from heat or water but disc brakes recover from those two issues quicker than drum brakes.  ","learn the difference between brake pads and brake shoes. understand why disc brakes are superior to drum brakes. "

"All you need is a solid character and a setting.;  , For example, the rules would suggest writing a plan along these lines: 'Plot: A, who lives in South Carolina, has a strong desire to be the next American Idol. If you write something using a topic so obvious and real as this one, it will be harder to write. It is easier to 'free write' a book when you have created a made-up place and events. That way, when you're in need of a town name, you can make one up, instead of having to grab a map and pick one and do background research on it.  Simply state the character's name (Sarah McBride) and the location (North Benadsway). That done, start writing using only those two things. This makes it easier, because developing a story is easier when you are not trying to stick to a plot.  For example, 'I have never wanted to be who my mother was. She was a dancer, a beautiful, graceful dancer, all dressed in pink. That is not something I want to be. I just want to be able to keep my overalls on, and sleep in my underwear like I did when I was a child. Can't I just choose my own future, instead of having it chosen for me?' There, you have your first paragraph. That is an example using first person, but other examples are available.  At that point, go and bake cookies or walk the dog. After munching on those for a while or getting fresh air (or both) get back to work!  ","realize that you don't necessarily need a topic. discard the temptation to write following the 'rules'. adopt the free-writing way instead. using only those two things, write a beginning paragraph. simply continue writing from this point, until you find a natural stopping place.

"Hold the bag up so that the wide end is pointing up toward you.;  ,,, Push it onto the end, narrow end pointing down.  , If you're using multiple colors of food coloring, which you probably are, you can separate your frosting into bowls and add the food coloring. Remember only to put in two or three drops of coloring, depending on how dark you want your color. Always try to make a little more frosting than you think you'll need, for each color. It's also a good idea to leave a little frosting white too, just in case.  There are a couple different ways to do this:  To make peaks, use an open-star tip. Fill the bag and gently press the end of the tip against the cake. Lift the bag up, squeezing the middle of it moderately hard. When you reach halfway up the peak, release your grip on the bag. This will take a couple practice tries but you'll get the hang of it soon, so don't be discouraged.  Making straight lines is completely easy. Just drag the bag gently across the surface of the cake, remembering to keep squeezing the bag. Keep your hand as steady as possible so as to not make the line shaky. Spread a thick layer of light colored icing, preferably white, across your cupcake. Now fit the bag with a #2 tip and a coupler.  Carefully pipe several thin lines in parallel to each other across the surface of the cupcake.  Drag a toothpick perpendicularly to the drawn lines across the toothpick. Don't let the toothpick touch the actual cupcake, just halfway down into the icing. Also, if you want a very swirly effect, you can do the first couple steps up to the drawn lines and then instead of dragging the toothpick across in straight lines, do it in circles or some other crazy pattern.  ","prepare the piping bag. unscrew the two parts in the coupler. , push the large part of the coupler as far down as it will go into the narrow end of the bag. , pick up the chosen size of tip. finally, to secure the tip, push the smaller part of the coupler down the tip to the tip's wide end and firmly twist the small part of the coupler onto the bigger part through the plastic. , fill the bag. start frosting.

"If you're delivering bad news, it can help to try to predict the reaction you may receive. Before confessing you lost something, think about how your parents may feel about this. Have a little empathy so you can predict the reaction and figure out the best means to deliver the news.What did you lose? Parents are unlikely to be angered by the loss of a small item, but if you lost something big and expensive, they may be angrier. They probably worked hard for the money to pay for a bigger item. They may view the fact you lost it as a form of disrespect or irresponsibility.  Considering how your parents are likely to feel, what's the best way to approach the situation? Think about how you would react in the same situation. How would you prefer the news be delivered?;  , You want to make sure you don't deliver the news at a bad time. If your parents are very busy on a particular day, they may react with stress if you give them bad news. Pick a time when both of your parents are free and relatively relaxed. This can help them keep their emotions in check. Also, think about place. Where is a good place to deliver the news you lost something?You may want to pick a public place, as this may force your parents to stay calm. They're unlikely to yell at, say, a restaurant. Try telling them over dinner or lunch when you're out.  However, if you're nervous, you may feel more comfortable having the discussion at a more private place.  It's never easy to tell someone you lost something. As you'll likely be nervous during the conversation, practicing what to say can help. This can prevent you from stumbling over your words while breaking the news to your parents.It may help to write down what you want to say first. You can stand in front of a mirror and rehearse.  For example, you can practice saying something like, 'Mom, Dad. I wanted to let you know I lost the car keys. I know it's expensive to have them replaced, and I'm sorry.'  , When having any difficult conversation, it's important to have goals. Before sitting down with your parents, think about what you hope to gain by telling them you lost something.Do you simply want your parents to know what happened? If you lost something important, like a phone or credit card, it's important your parents have this news. The item may need replacing.  You may also want to apologize and find a solution for the future. If you lost something your parents bought you, they likely want an apology. You also may want to find ways to avoid losing items in the future.  When introducing a difficult topic, you may be nervous. Let your parents know from the get-go they may be disappointed by your news. At a moment when your parents are relatively calm, carefully let them know you have something to tell them.You can begin with something like, 'Mom, I need to tell you something. I'm a little afraid you'll be disappointed.'  This way, your parents will be prepared for bad news going into the conversation. This will lessen the shock slightly when you confess to losing something.  At this point, there's nothing to gain from obscuring the truth. Tell your parents what you lost and how you lost it. Losing an item can be a breach of trust, and in order to regain your parents trust you should be as honest as possible going forward.Simply bite the bullet and tell them what happened what happened right away. Do not try to minimize or excuse your behavior.  For example, 'I wanted to let you know I lost my new phone. I'm really sorry and I should have been more careful. When I got home from the movies last night, it wasn't in my bag.'  , Saying you lost something is stressful. You may be inclined to cry or yell during the conversation, especially if your parents are mad. However, strive to keep your emotions in check. There's not much to gain by getting emotional in these kinds of situations.It's a bad idea to go forward with the discussion if everyone's moods are high. If you start raising your voice, or if your parents do, it's okay to put things on pause.  You can say something like, 'I see that you guys are really mad. Maybe we can continue talking when you've calmed down?'  , You do not want to be argumentative, especially when delivering bad news. Your parents may be angry. They may express their disappointment or frustrations. Try to remain calm and listen. Do not argue or whine in response.Your parents may want to discipline you in some ways. While you may find this frustrating or unfair, arguing will only make it worse. If you accept the punishment without argument, you'll come off as more mature.  'I'-statements focus on your personal feelings. You state your feeling, how your parents are making you feel that way, and why you feel the way you do. This can help things run more smoothly during an argument.For example, you can say something like, 'I feel stressed that you're yelling at me right now because it's not helping to solve the problem.'  An 'I'-statement can come off as less judgmental, as you're emphasizing how you feel over an objective assessment of the situation.  Your parents may be very angry if you lost something. They may yell or scold you. Instead of responding with hostility in return, remain calm and try to use words to deescalate things.Try saying something to acknowledge your parents' feelings. For example, 'Okay, I hear what you're saying. You're disappointed in me. You're making that very clear.'  You should let them know yelling is not helping. Try something like, 'When you yell though, it makes it hard for me to listen. I think we should work on finding a solution instead of getting angry.'  , If you lost something very expensive, your parents may be difficult to calm down. In this case, try to disengage emotionally. Try to avoid letting their anger get to you.Remind yourself everyone occasionally fights with their parents. Just because your parents are angry now, does not mean they will be angry forever.  Keep reminding yourself emotions are temporary as you deal with your parents anger and disappointment.  Sometimes, a conversation is not productive. If your parents are simply yelling and angry, propose you take a break. Say something like, 'I know you're mad about the phone, but yelling at me isn't helping. Can we talk about this when you've calmed down?' Then, get up and leave the room. You can go to your bedroom until your parents are ready to talk to you., Once everyone is calm, you can follow up regarding the conversation. Approach your parents again and say something like, 'So, I know you guys are pretty mad, but what are we going to do about the phone?' It may be a good idea to give your parents a day to process before following up.Try to figure out a solution. Your parents may want to look for the missing item. If it can't be found, they may want you to help pay for it.  Be calm when working towards a solution. No one likes losing things, but you will need to deal with the situation effectively.  ","try to predict how your parents will react. think of a good time and place to talk. practice what you will say. consider what you want from the conversation. raise the topic carefully. be upfront about what happened. keep your emotions in check. listen without arguing. use 'i'-statements if necessary. use your words to deescalate your parents' anger. disengage emotionally. leave the room if necessary. follow up later when your parents are calm.

"The lowest risk option for taking out loans for plastic surgery is a simple bank loan. If you're wary about using a credit card, consider taking out a personal loan from your bank.  Bank loans have a fixed interest rate and a fixed amount of time where you have to pay. This prevents you from accruing large amounts of interest over time. A bank loan can also help your credit rating, especially if you've never taken out a loan before.  Even with low interest, keep in mind interest rates on loans can still add quite a bit to the final cost. Try to ask for a secured loan if you know you can make payments on time.  Depending on your financial situation and credit score, a bank might not approve a loan for cosmetic surgery. If this is the case, you can look into alternative types of loans. One such type is an unsecured medical loan.  Unsecured medical loans are usually brokered through third parties. Your doctor may offer to act as a third party to help you get an unsecured medical loan. This is a good option if you have a low credit score and are having trouble securing money through other means.Interest rates on these types of loans can be quite high. You also might need a co-signer and if you fail to make payments your negligence will affect the co-signer's credit rating. Always read fine print when taking out a loan of this type. If you have any questions, consult an attorney., If you have a 401K you can withdraw up to 50% of the balance. Repayments are automatically deducted from your paycheck. While this allows you to avoid interest rates and prevents you from missing payments, this can affect your taxes. You might lose certain tax benefits or have to pay double taxes for some costs. Talk to an accountant before taking money out of your 401K.  If you're a home owner, a home equity loan can help pay for cosmetic surgery. These loans use your house as leverage and the amounts are based on your current mortgage payments.  As mortgage rates are at historic lows, this can be very affordable for homeowners. It is also a fairly quick way to get the needed money together. The housing market, however, is extremely volatile. If anything should happen and you need to sell your home, having taken out a home equity loan puts you in an extremely vulnerable financial position.Home equity loans are easy to obtain but as they carry a somewhat high risk they should be a last resort.  ","take out a bank loan. look into unsecured medical loans. use your 401k. take out a home equity loan. "
"Remember that you are an amazing person and you will find love again. To help lift yourself back up again, it might be helpful to work on improving your self-esteem.  Make a list of all the good things about yourself that make you lovable and able to love someone else.  Tell yourself, “I am lovable and can be successful at love because I am…” Fill in the rest of the sentence with things from your list.  Every day try to add one new reason why you are great to your list and constantly remind yourself that you can be happy.  You may feel like isolating yourself and just being alone, but this isn’t a good idea and won’t help you be happy. Being around people that love you is one way to remind yourself that you are lovable.Your friends and family want to help you because they care about you, so it's okay to rely on them for a little while to help you recover.  It’s okay to ask someone to just be with you – not doing anything or talking, but just being present with you for support.  Talk to them about how you are feeling about this love failing and how you feel about yourself.  For example, you might say, “I feel a lot of different emotions because of this love failing. I feel confused sometimes and optimistic at other times.”  Don’t resist their attempts to cheer you up. They just want to see you happy. Laugh and have fun with them.  Ask them to help you avoid texting, calling, or obsessing over your ex.

You should also see a counselor if you have started or increased using alcohol or drugs. Counseling can help you with these things so that you can be happy and is just a way of loving yourself.  Research has indicated that chemical changes occur in the body after love failure that may cause you to feel depressed.In some cases, your therapist may prescribe an antidepressant to help your body regulate the chemical changes that are going on.  Sometimes you may need to use specific coping methods to help you deal with the emotions your love failure has you feeling. Using these techniques can help reduce stress you are feeling right now, as well as help you be happier in the long-term.  Practicing deep breathing techniques can help you think more clearly and decrease some of the negative emotions you may feel.Try meditation as a way to calm your mind and heart.

"This is to ensure it's not switched on by accident while you're removing the glass, which could result in serious injuries.  If you can see its connection to the power outlet, simply unplug the power chord. Otherwise, break the power connection at the fuse box or circuit breaker.;  ,  Use a pair of needle-nose pliers to remove the whole glass, or in the more likely case that it is broken, all of the large pieces of glass that you can find.  If you can't move the glass at all, you'll need to dislodge it first.  Determine whether there's an Allen-wrench port at the bottom of the disposal, which is located under the sink. If there is, insert an Allen-wrench into the port and turn it back and forth to move the masher plate and dislodge the glass. If you can't find an Allen-wrench port, insert the handle of a broom or a hammer into the top of the garbage disposal and wiggle it around to try to dislodge the glass.  Remove all pieces of glass you can easily reach with the pliers.  Use a wet-dry vacuum cleaner to remove any smaller shards of glass. Simply hold the opening of the hose over the top of the garbage disposal and allow the vacuum to run until you can't hear anything be sucked up anymore.

"When you're riding in a taxi, the further away from you your belongings are, the more likely they are to get lost or stolen. If you have a large suitcase it might not be possible to keep it with you, but try to place it somewhere in the cab where you can keep an eye on it.If the cab has a trunk that locks, ask to put your suitcase there. Watch the cab driver place your suitcase in the trunk and make sure he closes the trunk door completely before you get in the car.  Don't part with smaller bags, backpacks, or purses – especially if they have your wallet or cash inside them. The best place for these items is on the floor between your feet. For additional security, you can loop the strap around your leg.  Don't allow your belongings to be stowed on the exterior of the cab, such as on an overhead rack, as they can easily be stolen.  If you are carrying items such as your mobile phone, a tablet, or a laptop computer, make sure they are well hidden before you get into the cab, and keep them out of sight the entire trip.You may not think of these things as all that valuable or expensive, especially if they are commonplace in your home country, but they make you a target for thieves.  If at all possible, transfer such items to a bag you will keep with you, if you are carrying them in a larger suitcase that must be stored in the trunk.  In the middle of the backseat you are less vulnerable to passers-by who might mug or assault you. This also keeps your belongings, which you have on the floor between your feet, out of arm's reach.No matter how tempting it might be, keep your windows rolled up at all times. This may mean the cab becomes stuffy or overheated, but with the windows down someone can easily reach in and assault or rob you.  These precautions are particularly important if you are a woman who is traveling alone. Almost anywhere in the world, a woman traveling alone is vulnerable to opportunistic criminals.  When you get out of the cab, you don't want to be fumbling for your keys or anything else you might need at your destination. Having everything ready to go makes you less vulnerable to street crime.Being organized and ready also shows that you are confident and in control. This makes you less likely to be targeted for an attack.  Keys threaded between your fingers also can be used for self-defense in the event you are assaulted or approached in a way that makes you uncomfortable.

"There are many ways that these products can cause and exacerbate acne around the lips.The wax from lip balm clogs your pores. This traps dirt and bacteria, causing pimples to form.  The fragrances in these products can stimulate sebum production. The increase of oil and sebum, coupled with clogged pores, is a good recipe for an acne breakout.  The lip balm may spread the bacteria that causes pimples. If this happens, you are re-infecting yourself every time you use it.  If you can't stop completely, use a fragrance-free product instead. This will still clog your pores but won't stimulate sebum production.  Crumbs or food residue left around your mouth is a feeding ground for bacteria, and may cause breakouts., Just like with flavored lip balm, chemical flavoring in toothpaste can irritate the skin and increase sebum production. Some fragrance-free toothpaste brands are Burt's Bees, Biotene, Sensodyne, and Tom's of Maine., This can help flush out your system and cleanse your skin from the inside out. Increase the amount of water you drink to help reduce acne overall.

"Keeping a strong immune system is important for not only preventing pneumonia, but also plenty of common illnesses and fatigue. People with weak immune systems, children younger than two years old, adults sixty-five years or older, and people with chronic health conditions are at a higher than normal risk of contracting Pneumonia. So make sure to take extra measures to maintain a healthy immune system if you are at a higher risk.  Eating too much sugar, not maintaining a healthy weight, stress, and lack of sleep can affect your immune system hampering its ability to fight off infection.Eat healthy foods with plenty of proteins and vitamins like fruits and vegetables.  If you know that you lack certain vitamins, like vitamin D, which we largely get from exposure to UV light, take the right supplements to balance what your body doesn’t produce enough of on its own.  A bad immune system can be a result of lack of exercise and being overweight. If you are overweight your immune system may not be working at full capacity.;  ,  Because Pneumonia can be contracted easily if you are already experiencing other illnesses, even the common cold, avoiding people and places where you might encounter more germs will help you to prevent getting Pneumonia.  Think about all the things you touch on a daily basis, and what parts of your own body your hands are coming into contact with, from your eyes to your mouth. Keep them clean to keep yourself healthy.  One of the easiest, and also possibly hardest ways to boost your immune system and prevent Pneumonia is to quit smoking.  Because Pneumonia is a lung infection, smoking, which makes your lungs more susceptible to infections, will make it harder for you to prevent or even battle the ailment.  Many doctors recommend this since it can protect you from many types of infections.  A healthy lifestyle has just as much to do with what you do as what you abstain from doing. This means avoiding the wrong kinds of fats in food, too much alcohol, or avoiding stressful situations.  Fats that are found in plant-based foods and oils like Omega-3 fatty acids are better for you than saturated fats often found in red meat and dairy products like butter., Take measures to ensure you’re getting enough sleep.  Sleep in the right position. You’ll get the best rest when you sleep in a position that keeps your neck and head straight. Also avoid sleeping on your stomach because it causes your head to lie at an awkward angle.  Reduce light and sound an hour before going to bed. Give your body time to wind down by not using any electronics. If you feel restless, try reading in bed.  Not getting enough sleep can also make it harder to fight off infections.  Once you know your enemy, you take measures to prevent them from attacking you. By knowing what to look out for, you can further prevent getting Pneumonia.  A cough containing strange mucus such as containing the colors green or blood like  A Fever, which may be mild or high.  Shaking chills.  Shortness of breath when climbing stairs.  Confusion.  Sweating and clammy skin.  A Headache.  Loss of appetite, low energy, and fatigue.  Sharp chest pain.  Talk to your doctor if you have a serious illness, especially cancer or HIV AIDS as there is a higher risk of contracting Pneumonia due to an already weakened immune system.Other factors like taking certain health medications, or a previous stroke can make Pneumonia easier to contract.  To prevent Pneumonia, ensure that you are eating healthy foods and getting as much exercise as possible.  Ask your doctor what you can be doing to prevent infection as they can make recommendations that are specifically tailored to you.  However, you may want to make sure that you don’t just have a common cold before making a trip to the doctor and spending the money.  If you feel that you may be showing symptoms, consulting your doctor as soon as possible can help you prevent the illness from worsening.  While you shouldn’t wait too long to go to the doctor if you do have Pneumonia, one of the ways to prevent getting Pneumonia is to stay away from areas where sick people are, like a hospital or doctor’s office. So it’s best to check to see if your symptoms resemble Pneumonia or just a common cold.  While this isn’t a cure-all or the ultimate prevention, a vaccination will help your body to learn what to look out for.  In addition, getting other vaccinations for illnesses like the measles or the flu can help prevent these illnesses from escalating to Pneumonia.  While a regular checkup may not find or prevent Pneumonia exactly, getting checked for myriad illnesses or conditions like immunodeficiency, blood pressure, asthma, etc., will help you prevent any other ailments that could lead to Pneumonia from getting worse.  Avoid drinks with sugar in them.  Water that is either warm or room temperature will be most effective for keeping you hydrated, and you can add a lemon for a bit of flavor.  , Sleeping a lot will help your body recover faster as not exerting yourself will let your body focus on fighting the infection.  If you have Pneumonia your doctor will prescribe an antibiotic that will help you to fight the infection within 2 - 3 days.  Your doctor will find which antibiotic is right for you based on your age, other health conditions, and medical history.

"The deep litter method is an alternative to cleaning your coop once a week, as you ought to do during the non-winter months. By allowing an accumulation of manure and bedding to begin to decompose, you provide a natural, healthy source of warmth radiating up from your coop’s floor. Instead of removing and replacing your bedding materials, simply turn over the soiled bedding and add a new layer of fresh bedding on top. The chicken poop will decompose beneath the fresh layer of bedding and emanate warmth into the coop.  Beneficial microbes that are inevitable products of composting even help control pathogens, making your chickens less vulnerable to disease and disallowing certain common parasites to grow.  In the spring, when you give the coop a seasonal cleaning, you wind up with a prime batch of compost ready to till into your garden.  Ventilation, heating, and even the size of your roosting bars all impact the likelihood of your birds getting frostbite. The best way to prevent frostbite, actually, is ensuring that your chicken coop safely shelters your chickens.Ventilate properly. Make sure you have an effective ventilation system at the top of the coop. The primary purpose of ventilation during the winter is the release of moisture that would otherwise build up inside the coop, increasing the likelihood of frostbite and infection.  Don’t heat the coop artificially. Though this seems counterintuitive, heating actually increasing the chances of frostbite as heat increases the amount of moisture in the coop. Increase ventilation if you see condensation form within the coop.  Install a wide roosting bar. A roosting bar that is wide enough for your hens to perch with their bodies completely covering their feet will help prevent frostbitten feet. Try a standard 2x4 board.  Different breeds of chickens are more hardy, and can better endure the cold. In particular, those with small combs are less likely to suffer from significant frostbite. Some chickens are actually quite resilient to cold weather.Select a breed with small combs. If you live at a Northern latitude, you’ll likely want to raise chickens with small combs. These include Easter Eggers, Buckeyes, Ameraucanas, and Wyandottes. Avoid breeds with especially large combs such as Andalusians and Leghorns. Note that roosters will likely be more vulnerable to frostbite, as their combs and wattles are often significantly larger than those of hens.  Choose a chicken breed known for cold-weather resilience. Birds with large body mass, from breeds that originated in Northern climates can better handle cold weather. These include birds from the four breeds recommended above, as well as Australorps, Bantam Brahmas, Barnevelders, Brahmas, Buff Orpingtons, Cochins, Delawares, Dominiques, Faverolles, Jersey Giants, Marans, New Hampshire Reds, Plymouth Rocks, Rhode Island Reds, Sussexes, and Welsummers.  Applying a preventative coating to your birds’ exposed skin and making sure your chickens are able to stay dry can go a long way in keeping your birds healthy and frostbite-free during winter.  Apply a protective coating to wattles and combs. You have several options in terms of coating. Coconut oil, petroleum jelly, or Waxelene (an all natural alternative) are all solid options. Whatever you choose, apply the coating to your chickens after they’ve gone to roost for the evening. Clean any initial signs of dry, damaged skin. Whether a mild case of frostbite or simply a scratch, cleaning a chickens skin can prevent infection. A good cleaning product option is Vetericyn, which is safe to use on all animals. Vetericyn is non-toxic, steroid-free, antibiotic-free, and is free of alcohol. It is designed to clean scratches, skin rashes, cuts, and irritated skin, and more, making it an all-around animal skin care product.Hydrate the heck out of your chickens. Especially during the winter, make sure water is always available, but only use containers that won’t spill. Prevent freezing by opting for plastic instead of metal containers, placing the water where sun will hit it, and floating ping pong balls in the water.Considering adding electrolytes to your chickens’ water supply to ensure hydration. If you’re feeling especially team-oriented, add a shot of your Gatorade to their water supply.  ","employ the deep litter method. ensure your coop provides sufficient warmth and shelter. consider the breed of the chickens you choose to raise. protect and hydrate your chickens during cold weather.

"To stay positive and maintain your happiness no matter what, it is important to recognize your value and learn to appreciate yourself. Having self-worth means that you do not base your value on what other people think of you, the job or title you have, or any other external factor. If you have self-worth, then you will see yourself as a valuable person no matter what.Try making a list of all of the things that you value about yourself that have nothing to do with your relationships with other people, jobs, or other external factors. For example, you might include in this list that you are creative, honest, and compassionate. You might also include things like your interests or skills, such as knowing how to play the guitar, being an avid reader, or enjoying fishing.  Leave out items that have to do with external factors, such as how much money you make, things other people have praised you for, or items you own.  No matter what, you are a unique person with much to offer the world. Everyone has flaws, but by accentuating the positive aspects of your personality, you can begin to eliminate negative thoughts about yourself.  A good starting point for being at ease with yourself is to not try to please everyone. Many people think that they have to “fake” their way through life because others won’t like them if they don’t seem successful. But playing that kind of role can leave you deeply unhappy. Focus on being the best version of yourself that you can be while surrounding yourself with people who care about your well-being.Surround yourself with people who care about you. Remember that if people try to pressure you into doing something that you don’t want to do, they don’t have your best interests at heart. Developing a close-knit and caring social circle is a great way to be at ease with who you are.  If you rely on short-term events or material goods as sources of pleasure, you may feel depressed over the long term. That is because you’ll get used to each short-term pleasure and your mind will need more and more stimulation over time to stay happy. Inject a sense of variety and spontaneity into your day-to-day life so you can avoid feeling like you’re stuck in a rut.  Try surprising your spouse or partner with a weekend getaway, or expand your skillset so that you can take on new tasks at work., Any time something good happens to you, remember to savor the moment as much as possible. Never take anything positive for granted. Be grateful for little moments of joy in your daily life.Try stopping for 10-15 seconds to think about a happy event. Remember to focus on why the event makes you happy and what kinds of pleasure you derive from it. Making this activity part of your daily routine can help you cultivate a positive attitude, which will have positive effects on your health in the long term., Many people ruminate too much on their mistakes or other bad situations while forgetting good things that they have done or that have happened to them. This is understandable because the human brain is hardwired to look for threats. But excessive negative thinking can be bad for your health.  When you have negative thoughts, try stopping to write them down. Doing so can help you put the thoughts in better perspective. For instance, thinking that you constantly forget to do something may look silly once you’ve committed it to paper. By subjecting negative thoughts to analysis rather than dwelling on them, you’ll find it easier to develop a positive outlook., Helping other people regularly can improve your mood. Whether it’s spending quality time with friends who are going through a rough patch, volunteering at a charity event, or donating money to charity, helping people will also help you feel good about yourself., Don’t take anything for granted. Show gratitude as much as possible, whether to your spouse, partner, parents, children, or friends. Make sure they know how happy you are to know them. If they know you appreciate them, they will appreciate you even more, which can only improve your self-esteem and mood.  ","build your self-worth. be at ease with yourself. maintain a sense of variety in your life. appreciate the little things in life. avoid focusing too much on negative situations. give as much of your time and money to others as possible. be grateful for what you have.

"Your concept of “cool” will depend immensely on your own aesthetic tastes, themselves informed by the culture or subcultures you count yourself a member (or simply an aficionado) of. If you think that flicking a Zippo has a place in looking cool, there are several classifications which might feel appropriate.  Rockabilly  Punk  Greaser  Grunge;  , Consult a style guide appropriate to your idea of cool if you’re drawing a blank here, or think of pop culture icons that appeal. Don your leather jacket, skinny jeans, studded denim, or oversized flannel, and express your coolest self.  If you’d like to embody the 50s greaser ideal, for example, look to James Dean for inspiration, or Grease’s Danny Zuko (John Travolta) and Sandy Olsson (Olivia Newton-John).  You can’t ignore the coif! Your hair needn’t adhere to the trendiest cut, but it can’t be ignored. You need to consider your appearance from head to toe.  It’s a good idea to bone up on some basic facts appropriate to these subcultures. Dressing punk and then not knowing where to take the conversation when someone mentions Sid Vicious is most assuredly uncool. , The particular ‘tude you present to the world will depend on your personality and what you, personally, aspire to be. Presenting oneself as aloof is a way to cultivate an aura of cool, but take care not to mistake disregard for others for aloofness. Instead, try to avoid become bogged down by negativity and minor concerns, and present a calm, collected exterior to the world.  While aloof is often synonymous with cool, others may find true passion to be cooler. You can’t fake passion—and really, you’re never be as cool as you can be if you feel like you’re faking who you are—but maybe don’t be so cared of expressing and pursuing your passion, whether it’s music, drawing, computer programming, scriptwriting, performing comedy, automotive repair, or anything else! You can be trendy in addition to everything else you are.  If you’re old enough to decide for yourself, it’s certainly your own right to decide whether you smoke or not. Know that you don’t need to smoke to carry and cooly use a Zippo, however—providing a light for others, especially those you’re romantically interested in, can make quite a mark.  If worst comes to worst, you can always light candles with your Zippo, though we’ll make no claim that you will look cool in any capacity while doing this. But hey—you do you.  You’re decked out in cool apparel now, but there’s a pretty integral piece of gear you’ll need to look cool while lighting a Zippo. That piece of gear is—you guessed it—a Zippo.  The flip-top and wind-resistant flame are what make a Zippo unique among lighters.You have plenty of options when it comes to lighters on the market, but for our purposes you’re specifically trying to look cool with a Zippo, after all.  Lighter fluid will evaporate after a week or so of non-use, so you’ll likely need to refill your lighter if it’s been more than a week since you used it. If it’s new it will likely be full, but it’s a good idea to pick up some Zippo lighter fluid ahead of time—you’ll be replenishing it often.  Take care to wash your hands after handling fluid, and ensure that lighter fluid didn’t soak into any of your clothes before lighting your Zippo.  The wick can also require occasional maintenance. If all you can see is charred and black, pull it up with a pair of tweezers and trim the scorched part., Grip it with your index and middle finger on the top and your thumb on the bottom, with the hinge away from you.  Both index and middle finger should move down towards your thumb, then take its place so that they’re holding the lighter on the bottom. Your thumb, meanwhile, will slide around to the Zippo’s frontside, near the flint wheel.  This is the tricky part, so don’t be discouraged if you send the lighter flying a few (dozen) times in the process. It will take practice and some intense snapping, but if you do it right it'll open.  With practice you’ll be able add a little more flair to the motion, flicking your wrist as flip open the lighter.  Quickly spin the flint wheel with your thumb. You’ll eventually be able to work this all into one, smooth motion, where the flame seemingly sprouts out of the open Zippo instantaneously.  Zippos can produce a hotter, bigger flame, so take care if you’re accustomed to other lighters. Their wind-resistant nature also means you won’t necessarily have to cup the flame to protect it, but whether you want to still do this or not is up to you. This is about image, after all.  When lighting a cigarette for someone else, take care not to press the flame too close to the smoker’s face. Hold the flame out close enough so that it’s convenient for them, but allow the smoker to comfortably lean in toward the flame themselves.  You have two options available to you for closing the lighter, but the slickest method is undoubtedly to flick it closed. Take firm hold of the lighter’s base with the hinge away from you, and snap your wrist toward you. This should snap the lighter closed without requiring you to touch the top.  The other option available is to simply push it closed with one finger. Simply place your index finger against the Zippo’s hinge, then thrust it upward to snap to top back into place.  Yeah, yeah, practicing in the mirror doesn’t feel cool. But the goal of looking cool will take a little legwork—direct your attention to the makeover montage in any movie for proof of this rule. Besides, taking the time to really put in the work to achieve something you want, even something as slight as “looking cool with a lighter,” is undoubtedly cool.  In order to become an actor, Henry Winkler worked hard to overcome his dyslexia. This eventually led him to portray an enduring icon of cool, Arthur “Fonzie” Fonzarelli of notable ABC 70s sitcom Happy Days. , Whipping your Zippo around indoors, or idly flipping it on and off without any need for it won’t make you cool: it will make you look obnoxious. So stay calm! The opportunity will arise, and when it does, demonstrate your new skill without drawing particular attention to it. Appearing cool requires the appearance of effortlessness, regardless of how much work you put into it.  The term in Italian is “sprezzatura,” a word that refers to the “studied carelessness” one exerts in order to allure and appeal. Embody sprezzatura.  The motto of the U.S. Coast Guard is Semper Paratus, meaning “always ready,” and guess what—it’s your motto now, too. If you don’t keep your Zippo lighter on you at all times, you won’t be able to display your proficiency with it! Make it a part of your routine when you’re readying to leave your home, and keep it near your keys or wallet to help you remember.  Not just cosmetically clean (though that’s a fine idea for pretty much everything a person owns) but mechanically. The flint wheel in particular can collect little bits of debris and flint, which will make it more difficult to light.Periodically clean the wheel with a small, soft brush.  Without being overeager, keep that Zippo in an easily accessible pocket. If a friend, new acquaintance, or stranger whom you’d very much like to leave an impression upon needs a light, patting yourself down for fifteen seconds before producing it isn’t exactly the smoothest move.  Smoking is an addictive, health-adverse habit. If you’re of age (18 in most U.S. States) then the decision whether you’d like to smoke is up to you, but know that your decision shouldn’t be informed by a desire to look cool. There’s nothing cool about the myriad cancers which smoking contributes to.

"Measure your lard or oil to get 1 1/2 cups (335 g) and place it in a large sauce pot. Turn the heat to medium and stir the fat a little until it melts. Take care to scrape the bottom of the pan so you incorporate any of the browned bits. This will also keep them from burning as the fat melts., Measure out 1 1/2 cups (187 g) of all-purpose flour. Slowly add a little of the flour at a time while you whisk the melted fat. This will prevent lumps from forming in the roux.Don't worry if the melted fat sizzles up a little as you add the flour. Continue to carefully whisk the roux.  Turn the heat down to low. Keep cooking and stirring the roux so none of it sticks to the bottom of the pot. You'll need to cook and stir the roux for 30 to 45 minutes so it becomes dark in color. The roux should become a dark mahogany color. You can cool the roux and use it in your gumbo recipe.Don't worry if the roux looks thinner than traditional roux used for thickening. Roux for gumbo is meant to be thinner and more flavorful.  If you don't want to use the roux right away, you can store it in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to one week.  Pour 4 tablespoons (55 g) of vegetable oil into a large pot and turn the heat on to medium-high. Get out 4 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs and 2 bone-in, skin-on chicken breasts. Place the chicken in the hot oil so the skin-sides are down. Cook the chicken for 3 to 4 minutes. Use tongs to carefully turn them over and brown the other side for 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a platter.The chicken won't be completely cooked at this point; it will finish cooking as the gumbo simmers. Browning the chicken just adds flavor.  Dice enough yellow onions, green bell peppers, and celery to equal 2 cups of each (300 g of onions, 350 g of green bell pepper, and 450 g of celery). Put the diced vegetables into the pot that the chicken browned in and turn the heat on to medium-high. Stir and cook the vegetables for about 5 minutes.The vegetables will soften and the onion should become clear.  Mince 2 tablespoons of garlic and chop ½ cup (15 g) of flat-leaf parsley. Add these to the vegetables along with 2 cups (276 g) of chopped smoked andouille or pork sausage. Saute the mixture until the sausage is golden brown., Place the browned pieces of chicken back into the pot with the vegetable mixture. Pour in 1 cup (240 ml) of the chicken stock and stir it well. Scrape up the bottom so any browned bits are mixed in. Pour in the remaining 11 cups (2.6 liters) of chicken stock.The chicken pieces should be completely covered with the stock at this point. If you don't have enough stock, you could use some water.  Stir 1 tablespoon of cayenne pepper and 1 1/2 cups (354 ml) of gumbo roux into the pot. Bring the gumbo to a boil. Turn the heat down to medium-low so the gumbo simmers. Put the lid on the pot and cook the gumbo for 1 hour., Carefully lift out the pieces of chicken and set them aside. Use a spoon to skim away any excess oil floating on top of the gumbo. Season the gumbo with salt and pepper and put the lid back on. Simmer the gumbo for 30 more minutes.If you want your gumbo thinner, you may need to stir in more stock or water.  Take the lid off the pot and skim off any excess oil from the gumbo. Put the chicken pieces back in the pot and put the lid back on. Simmer the gumbo for 20 more minutes.If you prefer, you can remove the chicken meat from the bones and put the shredded chicken in the gumbo.  Taste the gumbo and adjust the seasonings according to your taste. For example, you may want to add Cajun seasoning and hot sauce. Scoop some cooked, white rice into a serving bowl and spoon the gumbo over it. Garnish the gumbo with diced green onions and filé powder.You can store leftover gumbo in an airtight container in the refrigerator for several days. The flavor might actually improve over time as the flavors blend.

"Use medium-density fiberboard (MDF), 54x72-inch piece of green felt, bottom of two five gallon buckets, deck baluster, composite wood balusters, 2 inch PVC elbow pipe, 3 inch PVC pipe fitting, plastic drop cloth, green welcome mat or artificial turf, spray adhesive, wood glue, and cyanoacrylate glue that you can purchase at your local hardware store. MDF is smooth and easy to work with as it is a perfect flat surface for a golf ball to roll on.You may need added material if you want to create elaborate obstacles such as water hazards. This design has rough and a loop-de-loop.  Take your sheet of MDF and line up your deck balusters so they fit flush around the edges. Use a miter box and backsaw to cut the balusters to fit exactly, corner to corner., Use wood glue on each baluster as you line them up against the edges of your MDF. There should be a few inches of space between the lines of wood glue so that you may dab fast-setting cyanoacrylate.The cyanoacrylate acts to clamp the balusters as the wood glue dries so make sure the balusters are lined up correctly as the cyanoacrylate sets.  Close to one end of your MDF panel, mark of your hole slightly off-center. Make a hole at this mark with a drill fitted with 4-inch hole saw. Flip the panel over once the drill has poked through and continue cutting the hole from the other side to prevent the MDF from splintering., Clamp your piece of felt on a worktable so that it slightly stretches. Away from the felt, lay your MDF on plastic drop cloth and spray it with adhesive. Use long, even strokes to spread the adhesive throughout the entire hoard. Use adhesive on the felt as well., Make sure the felt is smooth and place the MDF at the center of the felt. Be sure to turn the MDF over without letting it touch the felt until you are sure that it is in the correct position before pressing it down.The balusters on the bottom of the panel and the hole will need a spray of adhesive. Allow everything to dry.  Cut excess felt with a utility knife and a framing square. Cut 1 ½ inches from each direction as you hold the square corner to the panel corner. Cut the felt diagonally., You will need help to pull along all the sides in order to lift the felt evenly and wrap it over your balusters., Section off the felt in the hole by using scissors to cut as if you were cutting a pizza. Cover the sides of the hole by pulling up each wedge and wrapping it tightly. Cut off any excess felt once the felt is folded over and inside of the hole is covered., Create a two inch PVC pipe fitting using a hacksaw on the PVC pipe fitting. Once cut, drop the two inch tall fitting into the hole., Use the lengths of composite baluster to line your course. The balusters will stay in place for balls to bounce off them. You may also customize your hole by adjusting them. You may create corner bumpers by adding short angled pieces., Form some rough by cutting green welcome mat or artificial turf. Create obstacles by placing pieces around the course. You may glue them down or leave them separate so you can adjust with each play., Cut off the lower three inches from each of your two five gallon buckets. This should leave an inch band at the bottom of each bucket. Cut an opening in each circular piece. Create a channel by bringing the pieces together by lining up the open ends. Spread them apart to create your loop.Use duct tape to secure your loop once you have it adjusted to your preference, screw the sides down to angled pieces of composite baluster that create a block.

"When you see a dog on a busy road, go to the edge of the side of the road. If you are in a car, pull over onto the shoulder and stand at a safe distance from the road. If you are on foot, walk to the edge at a safe distance from traffic.You want to get into a position where you can get the dog’s attention but keep yourself safe from cars.  If you are in a car, put on your flashers.;  , You want to try to get the dog to come out of the road to you. So, first you need to try to get the dog’s attention. The dog may be running down the road, standing in the middle of the road, or dodging cars, so think of a way to get the dog to pay attention to you.For example, try whistling, loudly calling to the dog, or making noises, like clicking your tongue.  After you get the dog’s attention, try to coax the dog to you. This may be difficult since you are a stranger. Clap your hands and use a soothing voice to talk to the dog. Squat down into a welcoming position that puts you closer to the dog’s height.You can say things like, “Come here, buddy!” or other similar things.  Make sure your voice is calm and friendly instead of frantic, scared, or aggressive. This may make the dog nervous or reluctant to come towards you.  If you have food with you, you can try to get the dog to come towards you using food. Wave the food like a treat, trying to show the dog that you have something it wants to eat. If you have human food, you can take a bite to show the dog it is food.If the dog is reluctant to come towards you, leave the food on the shoulder and walk away. Wait to see if the dog will come out of the road and towards the food.  When you pull over to the side of the road, instead of getting out of your car, just leave the door open. Often, if a dog is scared, they will see an open car door as a safe place to go. Try calling to the dog in a friendly, soothing voice.It may take some coaxing to get the dog into the car. Whistle, clap your hands, or use food to entice them.  If you can’t get the dog to come to you when you are standing up or squatting, try to make yourself less threatening by sitting or lying down. Sometimes, a dog may think you are a threat if you are towering over them. If they see you lying or sitting, they may think you want to pet them or let them crawl into your lap.If a dog is tired or scared, it may come over and lay beside you because they see you as a safe place.  If you can’t quite get the dog to come to you, try to get the dog to run off the road in the opposite way. You might try this by honking your horn, yelling, or throwing a stick towards the dog without hitting it. Think of a way to get the dog to run to the other shoulder of the road, out of traffic.Try yelling, “Shoo!” or “Go on!” or “Get away!” to encourage the dog to run the other way.  ","make your way to the side of the road. get the dog’s attention. try to coax the dog to you. tempt the dog with food. try to get the dog in the car. sit on the ground. attempt to get the dog off the road.

"Before you name your business, you should have a handle on your niche. Define your goals in your business plan and mission statement. A software company might want to emphasize the quality and simplicity of its products (hence, Apple) while an accounting firm might want to emphasize its accuracy.;  , You need an understanding of both what your prospective customers are like and what they're looking for when they come to you. If your target customers are wealthy, you might want to have a name that caters to their upscale tastes. If your target customers are working mothers who don't have time to clean house, you'll want to consider a name that either recognizes their busy schedules, their desire for cleanliness and order, or both.  In one column, list the qualities you want to convey to your customers. What are you 'about'? In another column, list things you think your customers are looking for. Use nouns, adjectives and verbs as possibilities.  Come up with a wide variety of words that are specific to your business. 'Rover' might be good if you plan to open a dog-walking business while 'persimmon' might be a great word for a Lebanese restaurant.  Consult a dictionary to look up definitions of the words you choose and a thesaurus to find synonymous words or phrases. You can also use a software application designed to help you brainstorm.  Trendy upscale restaurants will often have short, punchy names that emphasize simplicity and quality, like 'Fig' or 'Feast.' Likewise, 'Timberland' shoe specializes in work boots and their simple, earthbound name reflects their product nicely, whereas 'Tom's' emphasizes its personal human touch.  'Black Cyprus' or 'North Face' are both evocative and versatile. One noun and one modifier allow for both simplicity and accuracy, as with the name 'Urban Outfitters' or 'American Apparel.'  Try a gerund verb phrase. A gerund is simply an '-ing' word. This tends to make your business sound active and fun, a place with a welcoming atmosphere: 'Laughing Planet' is an organic burrito chain, while 'Turning Leaf' is a wine producer.  Incorporating someone's real name into your business is a great way to lend a personal touch, even if it's not a real person. McDonald's was never owned by anyone named 'McDonald,' while Papa John's pizza chain is owned by someone named 'John.'  , A portmanteau is a word made up of two words, like 'KitchenAid' 'Microsoft' or 'RedBox.' This lends an experimental edge to your business and makes it sound fresh and contemporary. You're inventing a word, essentially, so it makes a lot of sense for entrepreneurial endeavors.  Some simple sonic literary devices can lend your business name a memorable quality:  Repeating the initial sounds of words, called alliteration, plays to both sight and sound, in business names such as 'Papyrus Press,' 'K-Dee's Coffee' 'Smith Sound.' Similar to alliteration is assonance, which plays to the rhyming of vowel sounds. 'Blue Moon Pools' is an example of assonance.  Rhyming, whether exact or inexact rhymes, can make a memorable business name. 'The Reel Deal' might make sense as a dollar theatre or a fishing shop.  Playing off a colloquial saying is another way to come up with a memorable business name. A bar called 'Liquid Courage' or a coffee shop called 'Common Grounds' employ this. The risk of picking a corny or clichéd name is significant with this technique, but try it out to give your list as many names as possible to work with. You can always scratch it later.  Making a historical, literary or mythological reference can be successful. 'Starbucks,' after all, is named after a character in Moby-Dick.  Shorter names are easier to remember than longer ones. The Texas Oil Company shortened its name to Texaco and it's hard to imagine 'Jerry's Guide to the World Wide Web' having been as successful if they hadn't decided on the shorter 'Yahoo.'Even if you're using words that are made-up or use creative spellings, make sure they make some level of sense for the product or service. 'U-Haul' and 'Flickr' work despite their text-speak because they are accurate names for the business, not because they are spelled strangely. Naming your salon 'd' verse tease' is too clever for its own good.  It might seem like the best idea in the world to name your construction business 'Daedalus Construction' because you've studied your Greek mythology, but alienating customers by risking going over their heads is a risk.  This is where knowing your audience comes in: a comics shop named 'Jim Gordon's' might appeal to the Batman-obsessives while alienating the average reader though average readers tend not to shop in comics shops anyway. Think of it as a tradeoff. Upscale restaurants in expensive districts can get away with naming their restaurant something French, but it might be a bad idea in West Memphis, where your clientele might be made to feel excluded, or not 'in the know.'  , Too often, an adjective becomes train-wrecked into a noun, and a terrible business name is born, like QualiTrade or AmeriBank. Names like this lack personality and your business won't stand out in a market saturated with similar-style names.  If your business name includes Ameri, Tech, Corp, or Tron as prefix or suffix, you might want to reconsider and come up with a name that's less saturated.  Geographically-specific names will lock your business into a particular niche that will require changing the company name if it grows outside that niche. 'Omaha Pipe and Drain' will work for a plumbing repair business in the metropolitan Omaha area, but it won't help a plumbing contractor land a pipefitting contract in Des Moines or Kansas City. 'Kentucky Fried Chicken' officially changed its name to 'KFC' recently for this very reason.  Everyone called Bob Dylan's backup band 'The Band.' One day, it just stuck and they would be 'The Band' forever. If everyone has taken to calling your copy shop 'Main Street Copy,' don't risk changing it to 'The Awesome Copy Super Fantastic Fun Shop' because the given name isn't exciting enough. In the end, your product or service is the most important thing and the name is the package it comes in. If it's already got one that works, don't change it.  Alternatively, know when you've picked a name that doesn't work and take the risk of changing it. Even if you already ordered 'TACSFFS Rules' magnets for all the workers at the Main St. Copy joint, take the hit and go with the name that works.  Once you have a list of favorites, you need to make sure no one else has trademarked any of them. There are several resources you can use to see if the name is already in use.  The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office maintains a Public Search Facility at its office in Alexandria, Virginia as well as branch Patent and Trademark Depository Libraries. The most convenient way to search is through its free online Trademark Electronic Search System database. You can then enter the registration or a serial number of any mark you find into the Trademark Applications and Retrieval Database to find out whether the trademark is currently registered or has lapsed.  Some states maintain their own trademark registries, usually through the secretary of state's office. Other states maintain databases of fictitious names and corporate names used by businesses, either at the state level or county by county. Consult with your county clerk's office to find out how your state maintains its databases.  The Thomas Register lists business names and registered trade and service marks, as well as unregistered marks. It's available online or you can consult a printed copy at your local library., It's more than just a name you'll be registering--it's your whole concept and model for your business. You'll need to provide a clear representation of what you want to register.If you want to have a word, slogan, design, or combination of these things trademarked, you'll have to be able to provide a 'basis' for filing, which is essentially an argument for why a trademark is necessary for your business.  A trademark and a servicemark are distinguished in terms of providing a product (trademark) or a service (servicemark).  Fill out the application on-line, pay the necessary fees, and keep track of your application.You might consult with a trademark lawyer over the course of the process to make sure you're not missing anything.  ","brand yourself. address your customer base. make lists of words that represent the qualities you want to market. try a simple one-word name. come up with some simple adjective-noun phrases. use a proper name. make a new word. play with words. look for a short name that's easy to spell and pronounce. go universal. avoid clichéd. pick names that can work anywhere. pick the most accurate name. make sure no one else in your line of business has trademarked the name you're considering. prepare the necessary materials. file a trademark for your business.

"As soon as the food reaches your table, make some notes on the appearance. Is it clean and beautiful or messy and tired? Remember, a food review is about the experience, not just the taste, so you need to capture all of these details.  If you are at a restaurant that allows it, try and snap a quick picture with your phone. This will make it much easier to write about the appearance later.  Savor the first few bites, sampling everything on the plate before writing anything else down. Eat slowly and enjoy the meal before trying to get too critical.  Make sure you eat the dish the way it was intended first-- don't pick out any ingredients or try things separately until later.  Use adjectives and clear language when making your notes. 'I liked the use of rosemary' is not as helpful as 'the rosemary crust was light and herbal and perfect complemented the soft, fluffy potatoes.' That said, this is just the time to take notes, so don't worry about getting the language perfect.  Writing down specific details now about why you liked/disliked a dish will make your writing much, much easier later.  This is where you start to get into the specifics of a good food review. Try each part of the meal separately, checking for the following criteria:  Texture. How does the food feel in your mouth? Again, be specific, as there is a variety of textures, all of which can be good or bad.  Spices: Are the spices consistent throughout the meal? Can you tell what some of the spices are?  Complexity: A hard one to describe, complexity is a measure of the variety of flavors in a food. A good cook doesn't just go for 'lemon-flavored' or 'garlic & pepper,' they go for a nuanced, unique taste to their food. Do the individual parts of the dish come together to make something new or better than the sum of their parts?  , If you're with other people, make sure you taste their dishes as well and make a couple of quick notes. This is the best way to get a full idea of the menu and the restaurants strengths and weaknesses.  Be sure to write down the exact name of each dish for later reference. Your reader will want to know what to order or avoid.  A good review is rooted in fact, so make sure you're armed with facts. Of course, all food reviewing is inherently subjective, but that doesn't mean should only comment on what you liked and didn't like. It might be easiest to make your notes after you finish the course or as you eat, depending on your company. Either way, you should not rely on your memory to remember everything -- true food critics write notes., If you're curious what was in a sauce, how something was prepared, or where certain high-profile foods (meats, expensive cheeses, etc.) came from, feel free to ask. At high-class restaurants the waitstaff is trained to know about the food they serve, so they should be happy to give you an answer.  ","note the presentation of the dish. enjoy your first few bites. write down your initial impressions with specific detail. sample the individual parts of the meal. sample everything on the table. make specific notes as you eat. ask questions as they arise.

"Broadly speaking, the shade of your skin is most likely pale, medium, olive, or dark/deep. This should be fairly obvious, but helpful in choosing a hair color. You won't want your hair color to exactly match your skin's shade and tone or your hair color will look washed out., Regardless of your skin's shade, you need to determine what your skin's undertone is: warm, cool, or neutral. Wear a white shirt and stand in front of the mirror. Stand in natural light or bright incandescent lights if possible. Look at the veins on the underside of your wrist to determine the undertone.  If the veins are predominantly blue-purple, you've got cool undertones. If they're mainly green, you've got warm undertones, and if they're a mix between the two, you have neutral undertones.  If you're having trouble determining your skin's undertones, ask yourself a few simple questions. Do you look better in gold or silver? If gold, you've got warm undertones. If silver, you have cool undertones. What color are your eyes? If they're green, brown, or hazel, you've got warm undertones. If blue, grey, or green eyes, you've probably got cool undertones.One of the easiest ways to determine skin undertone is to consider how easily you burn.

"Many cats that have a strong fear response bite when they are surprised. If you know your cat does this, or you are in a house that you know has a cat that does this, then you should try to avoid surprising the cat. Make noise as you move through the house so that the cat knows you are coming and can flee as you approach.  Also, don't pet the cat if it is sleeping and does not know you are approaching it. This is a great way to get bitten.  If the cat is about to bite you because it is scared of you, then you should remove yourself from its area. In order to avoid getting bitten you should just leave it alone. Walk away and let the cat calm down on its own.  Trying to win a skittish cat over with attention will only backfire. Cornering a cat that is fearful invites a fear response and will make their anxiety even worse.  While exposure therapy can be used to get a fearful cat used to certain situations, this needs to be done with care and repetition. A one time visit with a scared cat where you will not leave the cat alone will not make the cat's behavior any better., A cat that responds to fear with biting should be allowed to flee situations that it finds stressful or scary. Don't try and keep a cat in an unpleasant situation to try and acclimate the cat to it. This will only heighten the cat's anxiety.Instead, put the cat in a room by itself. Provide food, water, and a litter box. Allow the cat to stay here until it wants to leave on its own.  ","don't surprise the cat. leave the cat alone. allow the cat to leave the room. "
"This is the program you will be using write and edit your code.  NotePad can be accessed on any version of windows using ⊞ Win + R > Notepad.  TextEdit can be accessed on Mac by going to Applications > TextEdit.;  , A section of PHP code begins and ends with bracketed PHP tags (“<?php” “?>”). “Echo” is a very basic statement (an instruction to the computer) in the PHP language that will output text to the screen. The text you want to echo must be enclosed in quotation marks and end in a semi-colon.  The code should look something like <?php echo “Hello World!”; ?>.  This is done by navigating to File > Save As...  In Notepad, add .php to the end of the filename and enclose in double quotations. This ensures the file will not be converted into a basic text file by Notepad. Without the quotation marks, the file will become hello world.php.txt. Alternatively, you can select the drop down menu under Save as type and change it to 'All Files (*.*)' which will leave the name exactly how you type it and the quotes will not be needed.  In TextEdit, no quotations marks are necessary, but a popup will appear asking you to verify that you want the file saved as .php.  Make sure you save the file to your “server’s” document root directory. Typically this is the folder named “htdocs” in your Apache folder on Windows, or /Library/Webserver/Documents on Mac, but can be set by the user manually.  Open your preferred web browser and type this address in the address bar using the name of your php file: http://localhost/hello world.php. Your browser window should display the echo statement.  If you receive an error message, make sure you typed the code correctly as shown above, including the colon.  Also make sure that your file is saved into the correct directory.  The “<?php” and “?>” tags tell the PHP engine that everything between them is PHP code. Everything outside the two tags is treated as HTML and ignored by the PHP engine and sent to your browser the same as any other HTML. The important thing to recognize here is that PHP scripts are embedded inside regular HTML pages.  Statements are used to tell the PHP engine to do something. In the case of an echo statement, you are telling the engine to print what is inside the quotes.  The PHP engine itself never actually prints anything to your screen. Any output generated by the engine is sent to your browser as HTML. Your browser does not know that it's getting PHP output. As far as the browser is concerned, it's getting plain HTML.  Adding HTML tags can alter the output of the php statement. The “<strong>” “</strong>” tags will add bold formatting to any text placed inside of them. Note that these tags appear on the outside of the text, but inside of the quotations marks of the echo statement.  You want your code to look something like:  <?php?  echo '<strong>Hello World!</strong>';  ?>  , Go to File > Save As… and save the file as 'helloworld2.php”, and open it in your browser by using the address: http://localhost/helloworld2.php. The output is the same as before, but this time the text is in bold.  Make sure you save the file to your “server’s” document root directory. Typically this is the folder named “htdocs” in your Apache folder on Windows, or /Library/Webserver/Documents on OSX, but can be set by the user manually.  Remember, statements need to be separated by a semicolon.  Your code should look something like:  <?php  echo “Hello World!”<br>;  echo “How are you doing?”;  ?>  , The page will display two echo statements, listed in order, on two lines. Notice the “<br>” on the first line. This is HTML markup to insert a line break.  If you didn't add this, your output would look like this:  Hello World!How are you doing?  , To manipulate data, be it numbers or names, you need to store the data in a container. This process is called declaring the variable. The syntax for declaring a variable is “$myVariable = “Hello World!”;”  The dollar sign ($) at the beginning tells PHP that $myVariable is a variable. All variables must start with the dollar sign, but the name of the variable can be anything.  In the above example, the value is 'Hello World!', and the variable is $myVariable. You're telling PHP to store the value at the right of the equal sign, into the variable at the left of the equal sign.  A variable containing a text value is known as a string.  Referring to a variable in the code is known as a call. Declare your variable, then echo the variable instead of typing out the text.  Your code might look something like:  <?php>  $myVariable = “Hello World!”;  echo $myVariable;  ?>  , Go to File > Save As… and save the file as “myfirstvariable.php”. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost/myfirstvariable.php and the script will print the variable. The output looks the same as printing plain text, but how it was achieved is different.  Make sure you save the file to your “server’s” document root directory. Typically this is the folder named “htdocs” in your Apache folder on Windows, or /Library/Webserver/Documents on OSX, but can be set by the user manually.  Variables can also contain numbers (known as integers), and then those numbers can be manipulated using simple mathematical functions. Start by declaring three variables called “$mySmallNumber”, “$myLargeNumber”, and “$myTotal”.  Your code should look something like:  <?php  $mySmallNumber;  $myLargeNumber;  $myTotal;  ?>  , Give an integer value to “$mySmallNumber” and “myLargeNumber”.  Note that integer values do not need to be contained in quotation marks. That will cause numbers to be treated as a text value like the “Hello World!” variable.  Your code should look something like:  <?php  $mySmallNumber = 12;  $myLargeNumber = 356;  $myTotal;  ?>  , Rather than doing the math yourself, you can call the two variables in the “$myTotal” variable. Using a mathematical function, the machine will calculate the sum for you. To print the variable, you need only add an echo statement that calls the variable after the declaration.  Any change to either integer variable would be reflected when printing the “$myTotal” variable with echo.  Your code should look something like:  <?php  $mySmallNumber = 12;  $myLargeNumber = 356;  $myTotal = $mySmall Number + $myLargeNumber;  echo $myTotal;  ?>  , Your browser window will display a single number. That number is the sum of the two variables called in the “$myTotal” variable.  Using a variable to store text allows you to call that variable any time you want to use the store value instead of constantly typing out the contained text. It also allows for more complex manipulation of the stored data moving forward.  The first variable, $myVariable, contains a string value; 'Hello World!'. Unless you change the value, $myVariable will always contain the value 'Hello World!'.  The echo statement prints the contained value of $myVariable.  You have explored basic manipulation of integer variables by using a mathematical function. The resulting data can be stored into another variable. This is only the beginning of what can be accomplished with these variables.  The two variables, $mySmallNumber, and $myLargeNumber are each assigned an integer value.  The third variable, $myTotal, stores the added values of $mySmallNumber and $myLargeNumber. Since $mySmallNumber holds one numeric value, and $myLargeNumber holds a second numeric value, this means $myTotal holds the value of the first number added to the second number. This value can change with alterations to either of the included variables.

"Accurately budgeting your start-up is crucial to making your business successful. Precisely itemizing your start-up expenses makes it easier to communicate with banks and investors. Also, it helps you to correctly forecast your profitability in the first year of your business, which has tax ramifications. Finally, your start-up expenses and any debt you incur become part of you financial projections for your business plan. Start-up expenses may differ from business to business, but include the following categories.Expenses for structuring your business. If you have to consult a CPA or lawyer, include those expenses. Include fees for registering your business with your state and for obtaining your tax identification number with the IRS.  Cost of obtaining licenses and permits and for complying with state and federal safety and environmental regulations.  Purchase or lease of your business location.  Purchase or lease of equipment.  Purchase of start-up inventory. Before you ever make a sale, you will need to purchase materials such as wood, glass, metal and textiles to make your initial pieces of furniture.Advertising and marketing expenses.  Wages and benefits for your employees.  Whether you’ve been doing woodworking as a hobby in your home or have worked in a more commercial setting, you probably already own some equipment. However, if you plan to grow your business by offering new products or getting into a new market, you may need to upgrade your equipment. Don’t waste time and money rigging your already-existing equipment to make new pieces.For example, Tom Dolese of Terra Firma Design in Bellingham, WA states that his investment in a horizontal mortiser allowed him to do complicated joinery precisely and efficiently.  Choose from a variety of methods for funding your business. You may have enough in personal savings to invest in your business. Or, you might have friends, family or other business associates who would be willing to invest in your furniture making store.

"Doing a split can appear deceptively simple. In actuality, this move requires a high level of flexibility in multiple muscle groups. The most important of these are the hamstrings and dorsal hip muscles (also called iliopsoas), however, stretching a wide range of lower-body muscles will ensure greater overall flexibility, lessening your risk of discomfort, pain, or injury. Additionally, this comprehensive stretching regimen prepares you to do both types of basic split - side splits and front splits. Besides the hamstrings and hip muscles, try to add stretches for as many of the following muscles as possible to your fitness routine:  Lower back (lumbar region)  Buttocks (glutes)  Groin (especially valuable for side splits)  Calves  Quadriceps  The stretching recommendations included the following steps in this section will target many of these secondary muscles. However, if desired, you may substitute your own preferred stretches.  This stretch will help your hamstrings and lower back. Lie on the floor next to a straight wall. Position yourself so that your body is pointing perpendicular to the wall. Raise your legs and place them as high as you can on the wall while keeping your lower back on the floor. Reach towards your toes with your hands - go as far as you can without excessive strain or pain. Hold for 30 seconds. Repeat 2-3 times.  This stretch targets your hip muscles. Begin as if you were doing an ordinary lunge exercise - plant one foot forward and lower yourself down to the ground by bending your front leg and sliding your back leg back until your shin lies on the ground. When you've reached the floor, put your hands on your hips and gradually shift your weight forward, keeping your back straight. Continue until you begin to feel the stretch in the top of the thigh where it meets the hip. Hold for 20-30 seconds, then return to your starting position and switch to your other leg. Repeat several times.  This stretch hits your hamstrings, lower back, and, if you can reach your toes, your calf muscles. Sit on the floor and spread your legs in a wide 'V'. Raise your hands over your head. Gently and gradually bend your upper body as you reach towards one of your feet. Stop when you notice pain or discomfort or stretching becomes difficult. Hold for 20-30 seconds, then return to the starting position and stretch towards the other leg.  You may not initially be able to reach your toes. This is O.K. However, when you can reach your toes, you may grab your foot and gently pull it towards you to stretch your calf.  This stretch mainly works your groin and inner thigh. Sit upright on the floor with your back straight. Don't slouch - if needed, you may sit against a wall. Bring your legs towards your body and press your feet together so that your legs make a diamond shape. Move your heels as close to your groin as you can without experiencing pain. You may also push your knees towards the ground with your hands for an added stretch, but use caution, as this can be somewhat hard on the knees. Hold this stretch for about 20 seconds, then rest and repeat.  This aptly-named stretch mainly stretches your quadriceps - the large group of muscles on the front of your thigh. You'll need one or two pillows. Lower yourself into a kneeling position with your rear knee on the pillow(s). Raise your back foot, then, keeping your back straight reach back and grab it with your opposite hand. Gently pull your leg towards your bottom. You should feel a stretch in the front of your thigh. Hold for about 20 seconds, then switch legs.  Alternatively, if you're worried about putting stress on your knees, you may do a standing quad stretch. Stand up straight, lift one leg up towards your bottom, then reach back and pull it with the arm that's on the same side. You may want to brace yourself against a wall with your other hand for balance.  Lay on your stomach on the floor. Raise yourself into a 'plank' position - keep your back and legs aligned and support your upper body on your elbows and your lower body on your toes. Place one foot on top of the other so that you're balancing on one foot. Gently push back with your body weight until you feel a stretch in your foot and your calf. Hold for about 20 seconds, then switch feet and repeat.  In addition to stretching out your calf muscles, you'll also get a light ab workout from holding the plank pose.

"Reinvention starts at the mind. You won't be able to reinvent yourself if you're stuck in the same old thinking patterns. While you may have many healthy thinking patterns, you could always improve some of the aspects of your thinking as you move forward in your journey. Here are some great places to start:  Think more positively. If you find yourself often picturing the worst thing that could happen in any scenario, thinking that everyone is mad at you because you've made a mistake, or convinced that nothing you do can improve your life, then it's time to make a concerted effort to be a more positive thinker every single day. Start by pinning down your negative thoughts and practicing positive responses to assure you that you're going down the right path.  Improve your thinking about the future. Many people are filled with anxiety and dread when they think of the future -- but not you! At least, not anymore. Make sure that any thoughts of the future, however uncertain, put you in a happy and excited place.  Improve the way you think about yourself. Gain confidence and learn to love the person you really are, how you look, and what you do. Without confidence, you won't have the ability to change.  Improve the way you view your situation in life. Learn to be more grateful for the things you do have instead of focusing on the things you want.

"To make a paper bunny ears hat, the first thing to do is prepare the piece of paper that will be your headband. Wrap a piece of A4 or A3 paper around your forehead at the height you want to wear it.In the middle of your forehead is a good place.  If you have too high it could fall off easily, but if you have it too low it might slip down over your eyes.  When you are happy with it, mark with a pen or pencil where two sides of the paper meet in front of your forehead.;  , It’s a good idea to leave a little excess, so cut the paper an inch further out than where you made the mark. Cut all the way up the paper and then wrap it around your head again to test the size. Once you are happy with the fit, you can slim down your paper headband by cutting horizontally across the paper. Then stick the two ends of the paper together with glue or tape.  You might need someone else to help you stick it together to make sure it fits properly.  The slimmer you cut the band, the less visible it will be. But it will also be more susceptible to tearing.  Now you have the headband you need the actual bunny ears. Just cut out two nice bunny ear shapes of equal size. You can do this by using a template or putting two pieces of paper on top of each other and cutting them together.  Once you are happy with the size of your ears, colour them in or decorate them however you like.  A traditional bunny ear would be white on the outside with a pink centre.  You can add pipe cleaners to the back of your ears to help you control them. You can keep them nice and upright and give them a little bend at the top. Just cut out two pieces of pipe cleaner, one for each ear, to approximately the same height as your bunny ears.Secure a pipe cleaner to the back of each of your bunny ears with tape or glue.  Now all you need to do is to stick the bunny ears to the headband and you are ready to wear them. You can stick them to either the inside or the outside of the band, depending on which you think looks better. Use glue, tape or a stapler to fix in the bunny ears. #*Sticking them to the inside will mean that you won’t see the very bottom part of the ears.  If you use glue, make sure you let it dry before putting it on your head.  ","measure your head with paper. cut out the paper to fit. cut out two bunny ears. cut pipe cleaners to the same height as the ears. stick the ears to the headband. "

"If your baby has ringworm, your doctor will more than likely suggest an over-the-counter antifungal cream. This will help to kill the fungus causing the rash. Common brands of creams include Lamisil, Micatin, and Lotrimin. You can spread the cream over the rash. Make sure to spread at least one inch beyond the edge of the rash spot.Use the cream twice a day. Make sure to keep using the cream for a week after the rash has cleared up or until your doctor tells you to stop. It usually takes two to three weeks to completely clear up.  Make sure to wear gloves when you apply the cream. This will minimize your chance of catching ringworm or spreading it to other family members.  If you don't wear gloves, wash your hands thoroughly before and after applying the cream — including under the nails.  You may also use antifungal lotions or powders.  Scalp ringworm can be a lot more difficult to get rid of than ringworm on other parts of the body. If your baby has ringworm on the scalp, your doctor will probably prescribe something stronger than over-the-counter creams. The child will usually be prescribed an oral antifungal, which may be administered for four to eight weeks.The doctor will probably also give you a special shampoo to wash your baby’s hair with to help get rid of the fungus and reduce contagiousness.  Garlic has antifungal properties that can help treat the fungus responsible for ringworm. You can make a paste with crushed, raw garlic to spread over the rash. Crush two cloves of garlic and mix it with a carrier oil, like almond oil. Spread this paste onto the rash. Let it sit for 10 minutes before washing it off with warm water.You can do this two times a day.  You can also use garlic oil. Add two to three drops of garlic oil to four tablespoons of almond oil. Apply the mixture on the rash. Leave for 10 minutes, and then rinse with warm water. You can do this two times a day.  Make sure to test any paste or oil mixture on a small patch of your baby’s skin before using it. Your baby’s skin may too sensitive for the garlic.  Make sure that you consult your doctor before using any natural, at-home remedies.  Coconut oil has antifungal properties which can help to kill the fungus responsible for ringworm. Make sure to use coconut oil that is unrefined and not hydrogenated. You can spread the coconut oil over the ringworm and leave overnight.You can apply coconut oil once every day.

"No one likes being next that guy at the gym - either on the treadmill or in the weight room - who seems to be over-exaggerated his breathing. Intense huffing and puffing can be distracting to others, so focus on how you're breathing to control and regulate your breath.  Focusing on your breath will help bring your attention to the sound, depth and rate of your breathing. This can help keep you a little more quiet, but may even improve your workouts.When you're lifting weights, fitness professionals suggest that you exhale as you contract a muscle or muscle group and inhale when you're relaxing from the contraction.For cardio, your breath should be steady and even-paced. Studies have actually shown improvements with running when the beginning of your exhale coincides with the strike of your heel on the pavement.  Breathing during stretching and recovery may actually be the loudest type of 'workout breathing.' Breathe in deeply and fill your whole abdomen up with air. Avoid lifting your shoulders up and down - this is ineffective. Try to breathe slowly and deeply as this promotes more oxygen in your lungs.;  , Your downstairs neighbors probably don't appreciate hearing you jumping up and down for your morning workouts. Focus on the proper, safe and quietest methods of jumping to decrease the overall noise coming from your workouts.  Landing softly and correctly not only helps quiet your workouts, but also decreases the risk for injuries. Landing incorrectly may lead to a blown out knee or a sprained ankle.One of the most important aspects of landing appropriately and softly is flexibility. As you land, bend your knees. At the end of your jump or landing, you should almost be in a full squat position.  Also, always begin your landings on the ball of your feet, slowly rolling back towards distributing your weight on your entire foot. This method of landing also helps force you to flex your knees and encourage the squat-like position in your landing., Another time you might find yourself making a lot of noise is when you're jogging or running on a treadmill. The way your foot falls may sound like a very loud splatting or thudding noise. Proper running form is naturally more quieter and safer.When you run more naturally, fitness professionals say your stride and footsteps are much more quiet. In addition, you reduce your risk of overuse injuries caused by excessive impact.Many runners have been told to run 'heel to toe.' However, now fitness and running coaches are suggesting that you hit the ground midfoot instead of at the heel.The next time you're out for a jog or run, focus on where your foot naturally falls and aim to hit the ground midfoot and roll forward to your toe to push off again.  Also make sure that your foot falls underneath your hip, not far out in front of you. This helps over striding (which can lead to injury) which makes running louder.  If you're a regular in the weight room or have invested in your own home gym or free weight sets, make sure you're mindful in how you're using them and setting them down. This is where a lot of noise can be made.  If you're using free weights, it's important to set them down gently on the rack, floor or bench. Letting them drop from your hands or pushing them off of you after completing a repetition makes for loud, banging sounds.  This misuse of the weights can also lead to damage of the floors, the weights themselves and if they land on your foot, an injury for you.  When you're using a weight machine at the gym or at home, aim for slow and controlled movements. It may be natural for you to finish a repetition and then release the weight and have it slam back to original position.  Even when releasing a contraction or finishing an exercise, it's equally beneficial to your body, progress and the ears of other gym members to finish slowly. The release of an exercise works your muscles just as hard as the contraction, so there's a benefit to not letting the weights fly out of your hands., Some exercises require the use of a yoga or fitness mat (generally out of comfort). However, these thick, foam pads may also help dampen the noise of your workouts as well.  If you don't have one, consider purchasing a yoga mat or fitness mat. They come in a variety of thicknesses, so choose one that works best for your typical exercise routine. However, the thicker the mat, the more sound and shock they will absorb.These mats can be used for many, many exercises - not just a typical yoga routine. You can do cardio exercises on them - especially if you're at home doing a cardio DVD, walking video or doing at home HIIT (high intensity interval training) exercises.  They're especially great for plyometric exercises like jumping jacks, squat jumps and burpees as they can help make for a softer landing, but also absorb more shock and sound when you land. However, be careful when putting your mat on a hard surface (like wood floors) because the mat can slip.  If you want to stick to a regular strength training routine, but are looking for a quieter method, consider doing yoga. This is a naturally quieter form of exercise but can be great for strength.  One of the reasons yoga is more quiet is that there are no explosive movements, no plyometric jumping or use of any free weights or weight machines.  In addition, yoga requires the use of a mat (or at least a carpeted floor) which also absorbs the shock and sound from exercise.Yoga helps strengthen, lengthen and tone muscles. It requires you to control and focus on your breathing and uses very slow and controlled movements. All reasons why this is a more quiet form of exercise., Running or jogging, especially on the treadmill, is going to be a little noisy. There's only so much you can do to dampen the sound of your feet. However, think about doing other forms of cardio instead.  If you're interested in doing some at home cardio or are looking to purchase a cardio machine for your apartment consider a stair master, elliptical or stationary bike. These machines make some noise as they are being used, but its very minimal.  In addition, these machines are more low-impact and there are not hard landings when you're using them. This also makes them a better choice for those with joint or knee pain.  Another option for strength training is using free weights or calisthenics. As long as you control how you're doing these exercises (especially free weights), its much quieter than using a home gym or weight machines.  When using free weights, make sure you set them down quietly, instead of dropping them on the floor. Otherwise, these are incredibly quiet and won't disturb neighbors or others at the gym.  Calisthenics are exercises that use your own body weight for resistance (often known as body weight exercises). They require little to no equipment and are very, very quiet.Examples of strengthening exercises you can do include: push-ups, crunches, planks, tricep push-ups and squats.  Although there are a variety of exercises that do not make much noise, there are some types of exercises or programs that you should avoid due to noise.  Many HIIT (high intensity interval training) workouts contain a lot of plyometric exercises - which makes them great at burning a lot of calories and building muscle. However, if you're jumping around a lot for a workout, your neighbors or roommates might not appreciate all the noise.  If you use a treadmill in your apartment or home as well, you might want to consider limiting its use early in the mornings or in the evenings when others around you may be sleeping.  Even though you're aiming to keep your workouts on the quieter side, still aim for the required 150 minutes of cardiovascular exercises each week.Even quiet aerobic exercises still provide a vast array of health benefits. These types of exercises work your heart and lungs and can help reduce the risk of high blood pressure and diabetes, improve your mood, help maintain a healthy weight and reduce your risk for developing heart disease.150 minutes or about 2 1/2 hours is the minimum you need to do each week. You can split this up into small bouts. For example, a 10 minute workout or walk 3 times a day Monday through Friday will help you reach this goal.  Choose quieter activities like: using the elliptical, walking on the treadmill, using a spin bike or walking DVD's.  Also consider asking your neighbors or roommates when a good time for you to do louder exercises would be. You can do a plyometrics routine or longer run on the treadmill if no one is around.  In addition to cardiovascular exercises, it's also important to stay regular with strength training. Most professionals recommend to do these types of exercises about 1 or 2 times per week.This minimum guideline helps provide additional health benefits to the ones provided by cardio. Strength training specifically helps strengthen bones, builds muscle mass and supports your metabolism.Things like yoga, calisthenics and free weights are great options to include if you're looking for a quieter routine.  Another great way to add in physical activity to your normal routine is to increase your lifestyle activity. Most of these are done away from the home so you don't necessarily have to worry about making much noise.  Lifestyle activities are those that you do on a typical day. It might be walking to the mail box, sweeping the floor or taking the stairs to your office. Although some of these activities do cause noise, they're part of daily living and don't last a long time.  Some studies have shown that lifestyle activity, when increased, has similar health benefits to more structured cardio (like going for a jog).Try to increase the amount of movement or steps you take in a day. Focus on activities outside the home so you can continue to keep a quieter environment where you live. For example, take the stairs to your office, park farther away, use a bathroom on another floor, take a walk break over lunch or even skip emails and deliver messages to co-workers in person.  Rest days are also important to your physical activity routine. They not only help your body recover and rest, but may be a great way to give your roommates or neighbors some quiet time.  Studies have shown that its actually during rest that your muscles grow in size and strength. Without rest days you won't make very much progress with your exercise routine.Most fitness professionals recommend at least one, maybe two rest days per week. You should still be active - maybe going for a walk instead of a run - but need to avoid more high impact or higher intensity workouts.  Try to schedule rest days when your roommates or neighbors are around or home more often. For example, if people sleep in later on Sundays and want to enjoy a quieter day, schedule a rest day for Sunday so it coincides with other's schedules.  ","focus on your breathing. land softly when jumping. run and walk more quietly. be mindful with weights. use a fitness or yoga mat. try yoga for strength and flexibility training. use the elliptical, stationary bike or stair master for cardio. go for free weights and calisthenics. limit high impact exercises. aim for 150 minutes of cardio exercises per week. include 1-2 days of strength training. increase your lifestyle activity. take active rest days.

"If your co-workers or friends are having difficulties understanding you, even if you’ve been practicing on your own, it might be time to seek out a professional speech-language pathologist (SLP) for help. SLPs work with clients on speaking rate, rhythm, intonation, public speaking, conversation, and accented sounds.Many larger universities have high-quality speech-language pathology clinics, so check your local university first.Use the search tools at non-profit organizations for speech-language pathology to find a certified SLP., A basic Internet search for 'accent reduction,' 'accent modification,' or “dialect modification” and the name of your locality. Some resources offer individual training, while others have group lessons.Group classes might be useful if you want to practice your accent with a wider variety of people.  Individual sessions are an option if you want to build more confidence before you practice with others, or if you need a more flexible training schedule.  Some clinics and professionals will request a phone consultation to evaluate your needs and goals before beginning your training., In order to help you meet your particular goals, your SLP will first evaluate your speech patterns. He or she will ask you to read texts and words of various lengths, as well as engage you in a conversation. He or she will be listening to your pronunciation, intonation, rhythm, and syllable stresses.The SLP will also listen to your speech in conversation., With your SLP, determine your goals for your accent modification process. These goals should be based on your personal and professional needs, as well as the evaluation of your southern accent you completed.Some goals are highly career related, such as preparing for presentations, performances, or interviews. Be as specific as possible when having this conversation with your SLP.  Your later sessions, in some cases, will be aimed at achieving these specific goals, so be clear about them early. You can also adjust them along the way, as your skills and needs change., The sounds of your first language, including regional dialects, were imprinted by the time you were a year old, so you’ll always have the hint of your original accent in your voice. Continued practice with your new, neutral dialect will reduce the effect of your accent over time.

"Some colleges offer a variety of activities before fall classes start. This could be a week-long trip spent volunteering in the area, or a camping trip where you and your future classmates would form bonds that could last forever. Your school may also have local incoming freshman meet-ups in your area in the spring before school starts; go to these with a big smile on your face. Though this kind of thing may sound corny, or like doing more work before school, it will definitely pay off when it comes to making friends.  You may not meet your new best friend at these events, but you're likely to meet a few people that you can hang out with who will make you feel less afraid of socializing. And the more people you know, the more likely you are to meet someone you really like.  When you get to college, everyone will be incredibly friendly, eager to shake your hand and ask for your number, and to talk openly about their high school experience and college plans. This is absolutely a fact: for the first few weeks of school. If you spend those first few weeks being homesick, calling your best friend, or generally engaging antisocial behavior, you will miss your chance to randomly introduce yourself to people in the cafeteria, in your class, or in your dorm.  If you wait too long, people will start listening to their iPods, drifting into their set groups of friends, and closing their doors to new people. This may sound harsh, but that's the way it goes.  When you meet a new person, don't be afraid to ask for his or her number, whether it's a potential friend or love interest. In the beginning, this is completely socially acceptable and won't come off as creepy.  When you meet new people, it's also a good idea to make plans with them. Say, 'Hey, are you going to that party tonight?' or 'Are you checking out the a cappella show too?' Finding something cool to do will make people more likely to agree to hang out.  Though about 1 in 1,000 college long-distance relationships have proven to last, it's just not worth it for you to keep up this charade. You're only 18, or 22 at most, and you should spend this time meeting new people, exploring your options, and spending your time outside your dorm room -- not on the phone with your boyfriend who is all the way up in Michigan, planning your fourth visit of the month. Nothing will isolate you from your potential friends or make you feel lonely faster.  You don't have to meet the love of your life in your college -- heck, you probably won't -- but closing yourself off before you begin the search is guaranteed to make you more antisocial.  If you really are devoted to your long-distance relationship, make sure to keep your phone conversations relatively brief and to plan as few visits during the first few months of college as possible.  Sure, your roommate seems kind of normal and is pretty nice. Does that mean you should spend the next four years glued to this person? Probably not. Your roommate is a great person to hang out with for the first few weeks of school, and who can help you meet some new people. But if you just have the sense that you're not friend soul mates, stop using your roommate as a crutch.  You don't have to ditch your roommate completely. Just be prepared to go out and do your own thing instead of following him around.  Sometimes, it's better if you and your roommate have a friendly, but not too close relationship. This can help avoid future awkwardness if you start having issues about living together.  Your college will be filled with an endless variety of people. Some of them will be shy, and others will be about as shy as Justin Bieber. You should find a balance of friends, of course, but you should pick out at least one person, or even a few people, who have really great social skills, are excited to meet knew people, and are always up to something exciting.  This will maximize your chances of meeting as many people as possible -- and of finding the few people who really matter to you.  Though college is all about making mistakes and bad decisions and living to regret them, you should try to avoid making a spectacle of yourself -- too much. Have some fun, get crazy, and dance wildly with your friends, but don't be the girl who pukes in the shower or hooks up with three guys on the first night of college. Unfortunately, you will be remembered for your mistakes, not for all of your great qualities.  Don't be afraid of stepping out of your comfort zone and trying new things; but do be wary of developing a bad reputation early on.  Having sex in college may be glamorized in the movies, but it will have many costs to your success in college, such as the possibility of STDs that could be deadly or getting someone pregnant when you are not ready. If you do, make sure you are well protected and try to do it at your own risk.  Freshman year is a major change and many people flip out and give up. Many freshman still haven't left their nest and the transition from being with close friends, siblings, or with their parents to a new environment might be difficult. This usually happen with students that go to college that is far away from home. Don't let this happen to you. It may take an entire year before you really start meeting people. Some college students who are not in sports, music or theatre, or in some technical program don't meet people really well until sophomore and even junior year!  Realize that once you have a major targeted (or are in a technical program or trade) and are done with your general classes, you'll find several people who have a similar schedule.  This eases the friend-making process tenfold. If you are taking generals, try to have a path too in your major so you can easily meet people with common goals and interests.  ","try to make friends before school starts. start socializing immediately. ditch the long-distance relationship. branch out from your roommates if you don't really click. find a friend who is even more social than you. don't humiliate yourself too much. don't give up.

"Your niche will determine the type of articles you write, as all of the articles you publish as part of your marketing strategy should testify to your expertise and inspire web surfers interested in your specific product, service or topic to visit your website. For example, if you website is a blog about Japanese food, then all of your articles should pertain to that subject.;  , The titles you use are extremely important when it comes to attracting viewers and improving your search engine optimization (SEO), and you should therefore take some care in picking them. There are a number of factors that go into creating strong, SEO-friendly titles.  Titles should be as short and concise as possible and should accurately represent the information that can be found in the article. Don't make the mistake of choosing a catchy title just to attract attention if the article content does not match up.  To factor SEO into your article marketing strategy, research keywords to choose titles that are likely to be searched for by web surfers (high search volume) and that have low competition.  Place keyword phrases at the beginning of titles, rather than at the end. For example, an article entitled, '5 Fun Ways You Can Teach Your Bird to Sing' would be more aptly titled, 'Teach Your Bird to Sing: 5 Fun Ways.'  Draw from a variety of resources for article marketing title ideas. In addition to keyword research, you can find title ideas by searching related blogs, drawing from customer FAQs and searching the web for your keywords plus the terms 'articles' and/or 'blogs.'  , Your article marketing will only be as effective as the articles you write, as low-quality articles are less likely to garnish attention and inspire visitors to your site.  Organize your articles into an opening paragraph, a body and a closing paragraph. The body should contain one paragraph for each main idea supporting the opening statement, and each paragraph in the article should contain 3 to 5 sentences; as with the title, keep the paragraphs as short and concise as is possible to get your point across.  If the publisher allows you to link to your own website within the article, the body content is a great place to insert article marketing backlinks.  Keep your articles between 250 to 500 words. Studies show that most web surfers are less likely to read articles longer than that.  Close your articles with a short (2 to 3 sentence) author bio containing a link to your website. This part is necessary to creating article marketing backlinks that can improve your site's SEO. Depending on the publisher, your bio may be placed at the end of the article on the web page, or in a 'resource box' area.  For example, if you have an online winter apparel catalog, you can feature summaries for articles like, 'Wear Your Scarf These 5 Creative Ways' and, 'Must-have Winter Coats' directly on your product pages. This will engage visitors and inspire them to stay and explore your site.  Additionally, include social media sharing buttons on all of your web pages, so others can share your articles.  Search the web for article directories to find submission sites that will accept and publish your articles. Include both niche and general terms in your searches to find a variety of applicable submission sites.  Spin, or rewrite, your articles if you plan on submitting them to multiple sites. Search engines may not give high rankings to duplicate content, so it is important that you give each article a makeover before publishing it in more than one location on the web.  Find blogs related to your niche and inquire with them as to whether or not they accept guests posts. When you find blogs that are willing to feature you as a guest poster, submit high quality articles with your bio and link.  ","identify your market niche. choose article titles. write high-quality articles. place summaries of your articles strategically within your site. share your articles on social networking sites. publish articles in article directories. write guest posts for blogs.

"You can use the results of your cost increase calculations to calculate increases in cost for all of your expenses. You can then track these increases over time and see if some items are increasing faster or slower than other costs. Then, compare the increases to increases (or lack thereof) in your income to see whether your pay raises are keeping pace with your cost of living., Businesses can use cost increase percentages to determine the increases' effects on projected or actual profit margins. This information can then be used to weigh the savings from a change in suppliers or justify a selling price increase. For example, if a business sees that the price of one of its inputs to production is rising regularly, it may choose to seek an alternative input or supplier of that input. Alternately, the business might choose to raise prices accordingly., Collectibles, like vintage cars, watches, and art, might appreciate in value over time. This appreciation can be measured using the cost increase percentage calculation process. Compare previous prices of the collectible with current market prices to assess the increase. For example, if a watch sold for $100 in 1965, but is now resold on the used market for $2,000, this represents a 1900 percent price increase., The same formula and process used to find percent cost increase can be used to perform a number of other calculations. You can use the same formula with different terms to calculate the percent error (between an expected value and actual value), to find the percent difference between two amounts of time, or any number of other comparisons between two numbers.

"If you are overweight and suffer from man boobs, then your most sensible long-term option is to burn fat and lose weight. Once you start to lean up, you’ll burn off fat overall, including in your chest area. There's no guarantee that this will fix your gynecomastia, especially if it turns out to be a problem with mammary gland tissue rather than fat, but it's a lot cheaper than the next method and it will certainly help you to feel better about yourself either way.  At the most basic level, weight gain and loss are both controlled by caloric intake. If you burn more calories in a day than you take in through eating and drinking, you will lose weight (and vice versa). This means that any successful weight loss plan must combine a healthy, portion-controlled diet with plenty of exercise.  Aerobic exercise, such as running, swimming, and martial arts, burns more calories per hour than most resistance exercise (weightlifting). On the other hand, building your muscle strength through resistance training will cause your body to burn calories faster in general, and especially when engaged in aerobic exercise. It is best to incorporate both types of exercise into your regimen.  Forget spot reduction. Bench presses, push ups, and similar exercises, though important, will NOT “spot reduce” chest fat. Remember, fat only burns off when your body needs to burn more calories than you have given it with food and drinks. Just focus on spending more calories than you save, and the rest will take care of itself.  Maintain dietary balance. As you control and reduce the amount of calories you consume, it is easy to lean towards a few food items and neglect balancing your diet. The fact is, the less energy you're taking in through food, the more careful you'll need to be to ensure that the food you do eat is providing balanced nutrition. You can read about recommended intake levels of various nutrients online and go from there. Alternatively, a dietitian can prepare a customized meal plan for you to follow.  Don't deviate from the routine you've set up for yourself. Bad habits form overnight, but turning a healthy lifestyle into a habit can take months. Be strict with yourself and push through the uncomfortable transition period until your new lifestyle becomes second nature to you. As you become fitter and leaner, your excess fat will slowly melt away, reducing your breast size and increasing your confidence.  Be patient. Real fitness takes time. There are no healthy shortcuts. Crash diets only cause your weight to yo-yo, so be sure to avoid the temptation of short-term results or you might end up in worse shape than when you started.  Work with yourself. It's important to be strict about not deviating from your diet and exercise plan, but if you do, don't get depressed and give up. Instead, vow not to do it again and pick up where you left off.  ","commit to losing weight. make a plan. follow your plan. "

If you have a hard time going grocery shopping every week due to your busy schedule, you should opt for the healthy option when you go out to eat. Look for an option that contains vegetables and healthy sources of protein, such as tofu or lean meats.  Set aside time in your schedule to work up a sweat for at least 30 minutes to one hour a day.

"In some cases, stress may be somewhat self-inflicted. For example, stress over work deadlines may be a result of a procrastination habit. If you can identify the reasons for your tension, you may be able to make changes to your situation that create a more stress-free environment.;  ,  According to the Mayo Clinic, studies have shown a link between positive thinking and one's health and well being. Positive thinking does not come naturally to everyone, but it is a habit that can be learned. The first step is to practice self-talk (thoughts that run in a continuous stream through your mind) that transforms negative thoughts into positive ones.  You can also list the reasons for your stress in order to more effectively identify stressors and deal with them at the source.  Physical activity releases endorphins, known as 'feel good' hormones, into the body to elevate your mood naturally.  These foods provide nutrients necessary to reducing tension, boosting the immune system and lowering blood pressure.  These relaxation techniques help focus the mind, relax the body and relieve tension.  Some of the easiest ways to reduce stress include learning to say 'no' when someone asks for a favor you don't have time to do and avoiding people and situations that create more anxiety and stress in your life. If factors like the news or discussions over hot-button topics induce tension, avoid those as well.  A healthy diet and sufficient sleep work effectively in combating the results of stress. By the same token, avoid behaviors that can contribute to tension, such as smoking, drinking alcohol and caffeine and taking drugs.  ","identify the causes of your tension to determine if there are changes you can make to reduce stress anxiety at the source. relax your mind through mental exercises like positive thinking that diminish the effects of stress and help you think more clearly. keep a journal to write about stressful events and how they make you feel. begin a daily exercise program that relieves muscle tension and promotes a healthier lifestyle overall. eat stress-reducing foods like oranges, almonds, salmon and spinach. learn relaxation exercises like deep breathing or progressive muscle relaxation to reduce stress anxiety and the physical symptoms associated with it. prevent additional stress from entering your life by eliminating the stressors that you do have control over. practice healthy habits that naturally reduce stress anxiety and avoid behaviors and substances that tend to make stress worse.

"Introduce the key bibliographic facts of the literary work and summarize the main plot or purpose of the work.  In the case of a story, you do not need to focus on specific details or give away the ending. You simply need to introduce the basic, overall theme of the story and provide information about the conflict the main character faces.  Most literary works have multiple themes that can be addressed, but for the same of your paper, you will need to focus on one theme that relates directly to your thesis.  Connect your summary to the theme in a naturally, sensible manner. For instance, if writing an essay about a coming-of-age story, you should introduce the coming-of-age theme with something like, “The broken friendships and family drama Jimmy has to go through serve as his passage into adulthood.”  , Lead into your thesis by briefly mentioning the main ideas of your essay, which exist to support your thesis.  In a sense, you will be narrowing down your broad topic into a more focused, specific thought by slowly presenting ideas that narrow the reader's field of vision until all that reader sees about that literary work are the ideas presented in your paper.  Finish the introduction with a focused, single-sentence statement about the thesis of your essay.  A thesis statement is a single sentence that defines a specific point or idea about a broader topic that your entire paper is built around.  With this type of introduction, you need to choose a thesis that makes sense within the context of your summary and supporting evidence.

"People who struggle with excessive hoarding save excessive items in a disorganized manner, often creating a dangerous living environment. People who hoard are often unable to discard any items, even if they have no monetary value. They save these items out of sentimentality or due to fear that they may need the item in the future.Hoarders often create rooms in their homes that can no longer be used as they are intended due to an accumulation of clutter.  Hoarders often collect newspapers, magazines, brochures, and other documents that contain information so that they can read and digest the information at a later date, but many do not get around to actually reading the papers.  Hoarders attach strong emotions to objects and feel that possessions offer them a sense of comfort or security. They may feel as though letting go of a possession is losing a part of themselves.;  , The reasons behind hoarding vary from person to person, but hoarders consistently show an emotional or psychological connection to the items. They also exhibit a resistance to thinking or talking about the extent of the clutter., If you do not live with the hoarder, be sure to stop by to check on and socialize with him when you can. You should use your visits to determine whether conditions are improving or worsening. You may need to evaluate whether the hoarder has reached a point of being a danger to himself.  Many hoarders may admit to being “pack rats” or wanting to keep things, but they do not understand concerns about health or safety. They may not see their behavior as problematic, and often do not realize the impact that their behaviors have on others. , You should communicate your concerns for the hoarder’s health and safety, but try not to sound judgmental.Try focusing on the health risks, including mold, dust, and cleanliness. You can also focus on environmental safety, pointing out fire hazards and blocked exits.  Try not to spend too much time focusing on the clutter or objects themselves, as this will likely cause the hoarder to become defensive.  For example, you might say “I care about you, and I am concerned for your safety. The apartment has become quite dusty and moldy, and because of the large piles everywhere, I don’t think you could get out quickly and safely in an emergency.”  , Organizing or throwing away items without the hoarder’s permission can give him serious anxiety.Instead, assure him that no one is going to enter his home and throw away his things. Offer to help sort through items or seek input from a professional organizer. Ultimately, the hoarder needs to maintain control of the decision making about what to do with items.  Try to use the language the hoarder uses to refer to the clutter. If the hoarder call the items his collection or his things, mirror the language he uses to seem more non-confrontational.  You can gather information and try to help the hoarder by finding out more about how and why he has saved and organized the items in his possession. Try to enforce the hoarder’s feeling of control; remember, you’re trying to help, not tell him what to do.  Some examples of questions to ask include: “I notice there are a lot of books in the hallway. Why did you decide to put them there?” “I’m concerned these could be a tripping hazard in an emergency. Do you have somewhere else we could put them?” “Do you have any thoughts about how we could make this area safer?”  , Productive goals that will help the hoarder will focus on improving the quality of life and the functionality of the living space. Be sure to make the goals measurable.  Do not focus the goals on negatives (get rid of all of this junk).  Do not set vague goals like “get the house clean and organized.” A better goal would be “clear the hallway and make all exit doors easily accessible.”  Start with the bigger concerns about health and safety, then move on to smaller goals that will improve quality of life.  It is important to be gentle and patient when working with a hoarder. Remember that hoarding is an emotional issue, and simply cleaning for a hoarder does not solve a long-term problem. You also risk violating the trust of the hoarder and losing any ground you may have gained with him.  Do not nag, force, or punish someone who is struggling with hoarding.  Do not argue or yell at a person who is hoarding. Instead, try to team up with him to work towards a goal together., Whenever the hoarder makes an effort to improve an area, praise him for his progress. You may notice a small area that has been de-cluttered or be able to see a patch of wall that wasn’t visible before. No matter how small the improvement is, it should elicit praise and positivity from you.  While it can be difficult to externally motivate someone, you may be able to find a way for the hoarder to become motivated to improve. For example, you might suggest that he can host a party or a social gathering. This may encourage him to improve his living area before other people come over.  A person who struggles with hoarding may not have the skills to organize and sort items themselves. If he is open to help, offer to help him organize and sort through items. You may want to gather storage containers, shelving units, boxes, and labels before you start.  Start by labeling boxes or bags with “keep,” “trash,” and “donate.” You probably need to make a space to pile items to think about or come back to.  Group similar items together. Seeing a large quantity of a single thing may help the hoarder make peace with reducing the number of a specific item. For example, if he has 100 boxes of tissue, he may be willing to reduce the number of boxes to 50. This is a small step, but it will help.  Categorize “want” and “don’t want.” You can start the “don’t want” pile with something that is an easier decision, like food items that have expired or dead plants.  Discuss where things that are to be kept will go. This may be a specific room in the house or a storage unit.  Two key indications of hoarding are social or occupational impairment and an unsafe living environment. Left unchecked, hoarding can lead to an increasingly unsafe environment, health concerns, financial consequences, and strained relationships.Specific hazards that can result from hoarding include:  blocked exits creating fire hazards or building code violations  increased health risk for environmental irritants such as mold and dust as well health code violations  decreased hygienic habits due to inability to perform hygienic tasks such as bathing  increased isolation and avoidance of socializing  strained family relationships, child neglect, and separation or divorce  , The process of cleaning and organizing a huge accumulation of items will take a significant amount of time. This is not a problem that can be fixed in one day. It will take a long period of small, persistent efforts to organize a hoarder’s home.  ","recognize hoarding behaviors. understand underlying issues that lead to hoarding. check on the hoarder frequently. identify the problem. state your concerns in a non-judgmental manner. ask for permission to help. ask questions about the collected items. help the hoarder establish goals. avoid causing distress. praise improvements. find a motivation to improve. develop a plan. know the consequences of extended hoarding. give it time.

During pregnancy, have the mother read pregnancy books, watch KidZone TV, and listen to children's music. You may do all three at the same time.  If you have the Showtime expansion, wish for a large family with a genie, or drink a procreation elixir., Find a Sim that's at least level 5 in the Medical career track (Resident or higher).Have the pregnant Sim have a friendly conversation with this doctor and ask to determine the gender of the baby. You will get a popup saying that you are expecting a boy or a girl. This prediction is always accurate — but only for one baby.  The pregnant Sim needs to be visibly pregnant before this option appears.  As described above, eat watermelons for a girl or apples for a boy. If you're lucky and end up with twins (or triplets), this increases the chance of getting the gender you want for the second child.  For example, if the doctor predicts a boy, eat melons to increase the odds of a girl. One baby will be guaranteed to be a boy, but if he has a twin, there's a high chance it will be a girl.

D = {1, 2, 5}  , For a relation to be a function, every time you put in one numerical x coordinate, you should get the same y coordinate. So, if you put in 3 for x, you should always get 6 for y, and so on.

"Modern—or show—Siamese are easy to identify. Their bodies have been bred for extreme qualities: modern Siamese are slim, angular, and have a deliberately skeletal appearance. The modern Siamese cat also has an elongated, thin neck and tail. The cats look elegant, and commonly appear in cat shows and competitions.Due to the rigorous breeding practices that went into breeding the modern Siamese, the breed is predisposed towards certain genetic illnesses. However, modern breeding practices have improved, and modern Siamese cats can live long and healthy lives.  Like any purebred animals, Siamese can be susceptible to genetic health problems. These include congenital heart defects (including aortic stenosis) and amyloidosis: a disease which causes excess proteins to build up in the liver.;  , Applehead Siamese, also known as traditional, are much less angular and thin than their modern counterparts. Applehead Siamese have thicker, stockier bodies, and their tails and necks are both thicker and shorter than those of the modern Siamese.Although modern and applehead are the two common types of Siamese cat, there are some that do not fall completely into either of these categories, but display a body type that borrows characteristics from both show and traditional Siamese.  As indicated by the name, the head of a traditional Siamese cat is rounded and almost apple-shaped. This is in stark contrast to the triangular, smaller head of the modern Siamese. The traditional Siamese will have a larger, heavier head that sits close to its body.Modern Siamese were bred for decades to have smaller and smaller heads, with increasingly angular features.  Modern Siamese with wedge- or triangle-shaped heads are genetically susceptible to respiratory concerns, such as asthma and bronchial disease, and dental problems.

"Striking is the art of punching and kicking your opponent. In order to compete with the strong man face to face, you’ll need to develop striking skills. Find a local gym and talk to the trainer about taking classes.  The most popular and effective striking arts include American boxing, Muay Thai Kickboxing, and Karate.  When fighting a strong man, use your speed to your advantage. Try to dodge his punches without getting hit.  Don’t think you can become efficient at striking or at any martial art, without going to an official gym. Muay Thai for example, has been developed for several hundred years and requires an immense amount of skill., Many fights end up on the ground, or in a wrestling or grappling situation. This can pose an obvious disadvantage if you are competing against someone that's strong. If you’re able to learn how to grapple however, you will have the advantage against someone who is untrained in any grappling arts.  Popular grappling arts include wrestling, Greco Roman wrestling, Judo, and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.Going to the ground may even be a better situation if you can get top control or your opponent is efficient at striking.  ”Rolling” or grappling practice is the best way for you to get experience. Take every opportunity to grapple with someone bigger and better than you when you attend your class.  Once you have trained and refined your technique, sparring will give you a real experience if you get into a fight.  While they could never substitute real training and sparring, instructional videos can give you a glimpse into different ways you can protect yourself from a strong man. If you can’t afford a class, or there isn’t one in your area, this could be an alternative.  Do not rely on instructional videos before trying to beat a strong man.  Make sure to check the ratings on the instructional video before you purchase it, so you know that others have found it effective.

"Start by spreading out the curtain on a flat surface, such as a wood table, a clean floor, or a clean counter. If you are trying to remove folds from a large curtain, you may need to work in sections, moving the section on to the flat surface to remove the folds.  You may lay down a piece of cardboard or a clean towel underneath the curtain to protect the surface from heat if you are concerned about damaging the surface. You could then move the piece of cardboard underneath each section as you apply heat to it.  Use a low heat setting so you do not risk melting or damaging the vinyl shower curtain. If you are using an iron, select the low heat setting so you do not risk scorching the curtain., Make sure you keep the hair dryer or iron hovering over the curtain and do not place it directly on the curtain. Holding it ½ - 1 inch from the curtain should be close enough for the heat to straighten out the folds.Run the hair dryer or iron over the folds slowly in small circular motions. Let the dryer hover over the fold for a few seconds, shaking the hair dryer or iron slightly. This will let the hot air disperse over the vinyl without burning it.  Focus on one section of the curtain at a time, hovering the dryer or iron over the folds. Once one section is flattened, move on to the next section.  It may take a few minutes for the fold to straighten out so be patient and work slowly. You may place your hand on the fold lightly to check that the curtain is not too hot or sticky as you remove the folds.  You may need to let the curtain sit out flat and cool once you have removed all the folds. You can then hang it up and use it.  ","lay the curtain on a flat surface. set the hair dryer to the low heat setting. hold the hair dryer or iron ½ - 1 inch from the curtain. remove the folds in sections. "
"Some people reach out to their exes in a moment of weakness, while others do so in hopes of reigniting some romantic interest. However, any attempts at contacting your ex will only dredge up painful feelings for one or both of you, and it will only prolong the inevitable. Remember that you broke up for a reason: one or both of you were fundamentally unhappy, and that won't change.If your ex's phone number was saved on your cellphone, delete his/her contact information and delete any previous text message conversations or phone call records on your phone.  Erase, blot out, or discard any physical copies you've written down of your ex's phone number (like from an address book, for example).  Consider blocking your ex from contacting you on your cellphone. Generally this is done by going into settings, clicking on privacy, and blocking the number of your ex, though the exact method will vary depending on the type of phone you have.  Turn off your phone any time you plan on drinking alcohol (if you meet legal drinking age) so that you do not text or call your ex in a moment of weakness.;  , Some people are able to remain friends with an ex. However, if you don't think you can be friends without having romantic feelings for him/her, it may be best to cut off all ties with that individual. Even if you've deleted your ex's phone number, you may still be able to send your ex private messages or comment on photos and status updates.Unfriending/unfollowing your ex on social media will help remove temptation to contact that individual. It can also provide you with space and privacy while you heal from the breakup.  Remember that if you remain friends on social media, you'll have to see whom that individual is in a relationship with in the future. You'll also be generally reminded of your time together, which may create feelings of longing.  Remember that you can always send your ex a friend request or follow him/her in the future, once you've gotten over the breakup. If you're feeling vulnerable and may try to contact your ex, though, it's best to cut that individual out altogether for the time being.  You may not need to do this, but some people may find it helpful to create some distance between mutual friends while the breakup is still fresh. If you think you might be tempted to ask a mutual friend to 'report' on your ex, or if you cannot separate the emotional associations of your ex with your mutual friends, it may be best to create a little space until you've healed and moved on.Let your friends know what you're doing and why. If you don't communicate with them, they may worry that you've decided not to be friends with them as individuals.  If your mutual friends bring up your ex around you, ask them to stop doing so, at least until you've healed from the breakup.  Avoid any situations or social events where your ex may be present. For example, if your mutual friends host a party or invite you to an event, ask them in advance whether your ex will be there.  The best way to heal yourself emotionally after a breakup is by accepting that the relationship is over. This may be difficult, especially if you were the rejected partner, but recognizing that it could never work out is important.Until you have found some sense of closure, you may continue to feel temptations to call or text your ex, and doing so will only prolong the suffering and emotional vulnerability you're feeling.  It's okay to feel pain and sadness - these feelings are normal. But dwelling on those feelings or convincing yourself that you've lost your 'one true love' will only delay your healing.  Recognize that it's okay to be alone for a while. You can find other exciting ways to fill your time, and once you've taken time for yourself you'll be ready to begin an even better relationship with someone new.If you're still thinking fondly about your ex or hoping for some type of reconnection, you haven't found closure yet. It's vital that you avoid contacting, seeing, or even accidentally running into your ex during this time in order to heal and move on.  If you're coming out of a long-term relationship, especially with someone you shared a house or apartment with, being alone may feel scary or intimidating. The best way to get over your ex (and distract yourself from any temptation to call him/her) is to be around other people as often as you can.Reach out to friends and family members, even if you haven't seen them or heard from them in a while. It's okay if you have to initiate the planning; the important thing is not to be alone.  Try taking up a new hobby or enrolling in a class, and ask a friend to try it out with you. This can be a great distraction from your feelings and a good bonding experience between you and your friend.  After a long relationship, you probably have a lot of physical objects that remind you of your ex. These may be little gifts and shared objects, and seeing them everyday can be a constant reminder of your past relationship. Getting rid of (or at least hiding) these objects that remind you of your ex can help you feel less compelled to contact your ex in the wake of a breakup. Box up anything that reminds you of the other person. Whether it's photographs, gifts, or belongings that he/she left behind, it's best to keep them out of sight.  If you can't keep these sentimental reminders in your home without dwelling on your ex or feeling tempted to contact him/her, throw them in the trash. Just be sure to arrange for a mutual friend to return any belongings that your ex may want back before you throw anything out.  Sometimes moving on from a breakup can be difficult. Even after removing the sentimental reminders of your ex, you may find yourself thinking about him or her on a regular basis, and that may give you the urge to contact your ex. If you're having a hard time moving past the breakup, making some changes in your routine or your life in general may help.If you shared a house or apartment, move out and find a new place in a different neighborhood.  If you work together or used to work together, consider looking for a new job.  If you don't want to leave your job but you still work together and share space, ask your boss if you can change desks to be farther away from one another.  Find other ways to change up your routine and your physical surroundings. Do whatever you can to make subtle changes in your life and erase all reminders of your ex.  Whether you were the person who initiated the breakup or your actions/behavior led to your ex breaking up with you, you may be carrying around some guilt. It's important to accept the past and move on in order to heal. Remember that no matter how guilty you may feel, your ex certainly played a role in things falling apart - and that's okay. Moving on means learning how to love yourself and forgive yourself for your mistakes. Eventually, once you've forgiven yourself, you may be able to forgive your ex as well., Every relationship has its ups and downs. Couples often fight, and sometimes things are said that shouldn't have been. However, if your partner has abused you (emotionally or physically), cheated on you, or otherwise neglected your feelings throughout the course of your relationship, there's a good chance that that individual would not make a good friend.Toxic people who have hurt you and may continue to do so in the future should be cut out of your life.This is best for your getting over that ex as well as for your general mental health and wellbeing.  Some people never stop feeling some type of attraction towards another person. That attraction may be physical or emotional, but it can make friendship very difficult. If you don't think you can talk to your ex or be in the same room with him or her without wanting to reconnect on some level, you'll need to accept the fact that you just can't maintain a friendship with that individual.If you're having trouble moving on, make sure you cut off all ties completely and at once.  Any time you catch yourself thinking about your ex, make a point of doing something fun and distracting. Go out with friends, watch TV, or find other ways to snap out of that mindset.  Being friends after a breakup almost always requires time and distance apart. You cannot transition from a relationship to a friendship without time to process and heal (if you're able to at all).If you think you can get over the breakup and ultimately become friends with your ex, you'll need to evaluate your feelings towards that person and consider how much time has passed since the breakup.Most people feel sad, lonely, or hurt/betrayed in the wake of a breakup. This is normal, and these feelings will pass with time.  There is no universal waiting period for getting over a relationship. For some people it can happen in a week or two, while for others it may take months to get over an ex.  If you still feel any kind of longing or resentment towards your ex, not enough time has passed.  Once you can think about your ex and not miss him/her or get angry about the breakup, you may be ready to consider transitioning to a friendship. If this doesn't happen, though, you may need to cut your losses and move on without your ex in your life.  ","delete your ex's phone number from your contacts list. unfriend or unfollow your ex on social media. distance yourself from mutual friends for a while. try to find a sense of closure. spend as much time as possible with friends and family. put away or get rid of sentimental reminders. change your life to stop thinking about your ex. forgive yourself for any part you played in the breakup. consider whether your ex has hurt you. ask yourself whether you could be friends without wanting a relationship. assess how much time has passed.

"Move your clippers to a part of the horse’s body that won’t be so ticklish. This is likely the neck or their sides.  Turn the clippers on away from your horse’s body, and allow them to run for a few seconds. Then begin to clip by moving the clippers in the direction opposite of hair growth. Try to keep lines straight and to remove entire patches before moving onto other sections. Watch the corners of the clippers to make sure that you don’t poke your horse with them.  Work in long, narrow sections to get the most even results. Overlap each new strip of hair your clip off, so that you don’t have any uneven patches. When you reach a whorl in the coat, clip out the hair from different angles to remove it all.  When you clip near the mane and tail, wrap it and move it to the side so that you don’t accidentally cut any long hairs. If you need, have a friend help by holding both to the side to make it easier for you and your horse.  If the clip style you choose requires you to clip your horse’s face, save it for last. This will help to keep their anxiety level low. Be sure to switch to the smaller clipper when clipping the face and other sensitive areas.  If you’re not doing a full clip, there will be areas of the horse which still have hair, and some of that will be a bit long. Use a pair of cutting shears to trim down extra long hair, typically around the legs.  The hair left on the ground will need to be swept up and removed. Horsehair does not decompose quickly though, so it should not be put in a manure or compost pile. Instead, simply toss it out with your regular garbage.  Your horse won’t be used to the stark temperature change as a result of having much less hair, so they will need to be blanketed whenever they are put out. In general, if you need a thin coat, put a thin blanket on them. If you’re very cold, they’re also going to need a thick winter blanket.

"The heartbreak of a break-up isn't permanent. We know it doesn't feel like that—it feels like you'll never be whole again. That you can never be happy without them. But it's not true. You will move on, and you will feel like yourself again. At the end of the day, you just need time and a little TLC towards yourself.;  , After you break up, you may find that you have lots of extra time and money that you no longer have to spend on your ex. So date yourself! Throw some dollar bills in the air and make yourself feel like a king or queen. Getting used to single life isn't all depressing—it's about putting you first. Remember, there's nothing wrong with showing yourself a little love - especially after a hardship like a breakup.  Get what you want. Even better, get what they didn't want you to have when you were dating. Your shackles are off—enjoy the freedom!  , The best ways to leave behind the painful memories? Literally leave them behind. New sights, sounds, and experiences stimulate the senses, making the pain of a breakup seem distant and unimportant. Added bonus: you won't be driven to tears looking at the coffee maker you used to share each morning.  Even a short trip, like a new cafe or running route, will shake some of the baggage off.  You want to avoid interacting with people and things that remind you of your ex. You don't have to throw it all out—there is no reason to be heartless—but you do have to pack it away. Throw the old shirts, photographs, and mementos in a box and bury it in the attic or basement. It won't be easy packing all those things up, but it is necessary. Once the mementos are all gone, you don't have to hold back the tears every time you pass that one photo of you two last summer.  If you're looking for a change in your life, try changing the company you keep. The world is a big, wide place, and though your sweetheart might have seemed like the bee's knees when you were dating, they're not the only fish in the sea. New friends bring new perspectives, activities, and conversations—and you'll soon be wondering, 'ex-who?'.  This advice is especially important if, after a breakup, you find that some of your friends have 'sided' with your ex. Pay these people no attention—focus your energy on finding friends who respect your choices.  Significant others take lots of time and energy—leaving your best bros and gal pals wondering if you fell off the face of the earth. This is nothing to be ashamed of - everyone has to budget their limited time between partners and friends. Now that the shackles of romance are off, though, it's time to pay the old gang a visit. You may find that both of your lives have changed since you last had contact, and there is nothing like catching up with old friends.  During a relationship, when you're splitting time between your own interests and desires and those of your partner, it can be tricky to find time to do all of the things you'd like to. The silver lining of a breakup is that you suddenly have lots more time to spend on yourself. Stop spending that time feeling sad for yourself and go do something! Play a video game, cook a new recipe, go for a hike—anything! Just get out of the house already and use your newfound freedom.  Sometimes, after a breakup, the intensely negative emotions that result can leave you feeling like you're boring and that you don't have any hobbies or interests worth mentioning. That's bull—you can go online right now and find a new activity to explore in your area.  Work towards bettering yourself physically and mentally. Chances are good you've let your passion project slip away. You've gotten used to sweatpants and Netflix every Friday. You've eaten more stir-fry (your beau's favorite) than is healthy or exciting. You still have a gym membership?! Kick off the dust and get back to basics—you've got plenty of time to focus on you. Most importantly for the lovebirds out there, self-improvement ups your confidence and makes you even more appealing for the next catch to come along.  Exercise been clinically proven to fight depression, anxiety, and stress. It doesn't matter what you do, you need to be moving your body.Building muscles isn't the only way to better yourself. Hone your mind by learning a new skill, exploring a new creative outlet, or mastering a new area of study.You may want to try learning a new language (Polish! Swahili! Wolof!), becoming skilled at a vocational trade (Jewelry Maker! Artisanal Jam Chef! Gardener! Amazing Race Contestant!), or learning how to play a musical instrument (you know these already).  Rebound relationships get a bad rap that they don't deserve. There's not anything wrong with having a low-stakes, lighthearted relationship following a breakup of a major relationship. However, you must be perfectly clear about your goals and intentions from the start. Saying something like, 'Hey, I should let you know that I just got out of a difficult relationship, so I'm just looking for something casual' lets your partner know that you're not looking for marriage, just a bit of fun.  It should go without saying, a rebound is no reason to get careless. You're with new people now—wear protection and get to know your partners.  The people who love you - your family members, personal mentors, and close friends - want to see you happy. If you're unhappy after a breakup, don't be afraid to ask these people for a little extra love. After all, we all need somebody to lean on. Talking to an old friend, a parent, a sibling, or someone else who's close helps you eliminate built-up stress and patch the whole in your heart. Your love was not the only person that loved you—you just have to remember that and spend time with those that matter.  Even if you find that the advice you receive from your close confidants isn't perfect, the sense of comradeship you get from your close relationships can be exactly what you need when you're reeling from the loss of an ex.  After you've spent time on yourself, had a few flings, and enjoyed the single life, you'll eventually want to start a new relationship. That's great! When you're ready, you're ready—but don't feel like you need to jump into a new relationship to feel normal again. There is no 'perfect' amount of time to wait, so don't let anyone tell you otherwise.  It may or may not be appropriate to restart a relationship with someone you had a bad breakup with. At the end of the day, it's your call. However, if they were abusive or manipulative, keep them away with a thirty-nine and half foot pole.  Some people take weeks or months to feel '100%' after a painful breakup. Ultimately, there's no substitute for the natural healing power of time. As you get further removed from your breakup, it'll creep less and less into your thoughts. You'll feel normal again. You won't be awkward at parties (not that you were before!), and you'll get an eye for that cute coworker or friend. The pain won't go away immediately, but it will go away with time.  There will be bumps in the road—holidays, events you used to do together, watching your favorite 'couple's night' TV shows—but this is natural. It will fade.  You may feel like you've made a mistake, or like you won't ever be able to find another partner again. These feelings, though nasty, aren't really that weird, it is perfectly natural. But don't let temporary feelings of low self-worth sabotage your chance at escaping a relationship you aren't happy in. The last thing you'll want to do is come begging your ex for forgiveness right after breaking up. Give your breakup time to 'set in' before you even think about the decision again, otherwise you're wasting valuable mental energy on the dunce you just dumped or the dummy who just dumped you. Either way, they're not worth your negative energy.  If you're seriously regretting breaking up with your ex, wait 2-3 months. If you still feel that way, you can consider calling. But you can only consider it! Chances are good you're starting to move on anyway.  In the days, weeks, and even months following a romantic split, your emotions are going to be a hot mess. You may find that you feel conflicting feelings of sadness, relief, frustration, and/or nervousness. This is perfectly normal - breakups can lead to long periods of emotional unease where you don't feel 'right' for a long time. While you're in the middle of such a period, it's always a good idea to avoid any and all forms of contact with your ex until you feel better. Strong emphasis on the 'any and all.' Don't see, call, text, email, or otherwise interact with your ex until you're well on your way to moving on.  Sometimes, exceptions must be made to this rule in order to reclaim any personal possessions that your ex still has, or to sort out any official business (bank accounts, etc.) that remains unresolved. Keep the interaction as short, basic, and polite as possible. If you can't bear to see your ex, try sending a friend to do your business instead—you should be more worried about moving on.  It seems like a good idea to blow your savings on a 2-week trip to Cuba after a breakup, but is it really? Don't make any major decisions until you've had time to cool off and calmly consider your possibilities. A single bad decision made in a moment of anger or frustration can have long-lasting consequences that may make it more difficult to move on in the long run. For reference in times of need, here is a list of things you should not do after a breakup:  Vandalize your ex's property.  Sabotage your ex's next relationship.  Confront your ex in public, or spread hurtful rumors.  Spend exorbitant amounts of money as a hobby.  Move, buy, or sell your house and possessions.  Quit your job or change careers suddenly.  If they hurt you, you still need to report things. This is especially important if you are worried for your safety after the breakup. To clarify this last point, if your ex abused you in any way, you can and should tell the proper authorities. No one else, after all, should go through what you went through. See:  How to Report Sexual Abuse  How to Report Domestic Violence  , Today, unfortunately, the idea of 'going to a therapist' carries a certain social stigma, but that stigma is a load of hogwash. It's sometimes thought that the person looking for help is mentally unstable or emotionally 'weak'. But 48% of Americans have seen a therapist or asked for mental or psychological help—you are far from alone.Millions of average, ordinary people talk to therapists, counselors, advisers, and other professionals for advice and guidance during difficult times.There's no reason at all to be afraid to get help.  Some of the people you may consider talking to are professional therapists, psychiatrists, school and occupational counselors, and, if desired, authoritative voices in your community like priests or rabbis. Just find a voice you trust and you're in good hands.  ","give it time. treat yo'self!, get away from all the painful memories and locations. wipe the traces of your ex out of your life. make newer, better friends. rekindle old friendships you forgot in the midst of your torrid love. do something other than just wallowing in pity. there may be parts of your life that could use a little clean-up. get back into the game with a fling or 'rebound' hookup. fall back on your friends and family for support. move on whenever it feels right. realize that the pain won't leave this morning, or the next hearts aren't mended in a day's time. don't look back in anger. don't allow any contact with your ex until you've emotionally 'reset'. avoid rash decisions or major life changes without some forethought. don't shove abusive relationships under the rug. see a therapist if you're still struggling to move on.

"Finding the cheapest flights requires a rigorous search involving multiple search engines and airlines. However, many airfare search engines are actually owned or operated by major airlines, meaning unbiased searches are off the menu. Rather than sticking to search engines you see advertised on television, look for search engines that hunt down the cheapest fares among large airlines and small ones alike.  Try out matrix.itasoftware.com. This website was developed by MIT in the 90’s and works by searching other airfare search engines. Flight inception? Maybe. But definitely one of the best means of finding cheap flights.Use skyscanner.net. This neat website searches all airlines, big and small, and allows you to look for the cheapest rates out of your local, rather than getting bogged down with specifics. Meaning, if you know you want to go on vacation but aren’t too picky about where, this website will provide the cheapest flights to everywhere in the world from the nearest airports to you.  Momondo.com is a great option for searching airlines for cheap international flights. Rather than getting stuck paying high prices for large international carriers, this site will provide even the smallest international carriers in its search options.;  , This is a very simple and effective trick to find cheap flights. Sometimes flights from local airport to your destination can be quite expensive while, on the contrary, flights from nearby airports can be really cheap. For example, international flights from Seattle are quite cheap when compared to international flights from Vancouver and the distance between the two cities is only 234 km (about a two and half hour drive). So driving or taking a bus to the nearby airport is sometimes a good way to get to your destination cheaply.  Although airfare search engines are great, what they don’t tell you is that some airlines reserve their best deals for people who visit their sites specifically. Search for a list of large and local carriers in your area, and then search each of their sites specifically for the best deals. When coupons, discounts, or sales are offered, they will typically only be advertised on each specific carrier’s site and will run for only 1-3 days.  Spamming your email or message inbox on your phone doesn’t seem like the most organized way to get a deal, but travel alerts often offer amazing prices you wouldn’t otherwise be aware of. If your favorite airlines or airfare search engine offers travel alerts sent to your phone or email, sign yourself up! You won’t regret the few seconds it takes to delete those extra unwanted messages when you get the ones worth several hundred dollars worth of savings.  Airfarewatchdog.com is a website run by people (not a computer) who search for the best deals and send them to your email. You can add specific search criteria via their site as well, allowing only deals pertaining to certain locations or times to be sent to your inbox.  Flightfox.com is run by travel agents who individually search and hand-pick the best deals to be sent to you. This service requires a 29$ startup fee, but the site claims it will be fully refunded if you aren’t pleased with your results., You may feel silly adding an airline to your “liked” pages on Facebook or following them on Twitter, but the benefit of doing so is the special offers you’ll receive. Airlines want to reward regular customers and encourage them to continue flying with them, so they will often advertise special low rates and discounts via social media sites only. Follow as many airlines as you can for the best chances of getting a sweet deal., Turns out, there is a best time to search for flights. After several studies of domestic (to the US) air carriers, it has been determined that the best time to search for flights is around 3:00pm Eastern time on a Tuesday. Why? Around this time is when airlines release their discounted flight options, and look to fill up last-minute flights for the upcoming weekend. Therefore, save your flight searching for a mid-afternoon break on the nearest upcoming Tuesday., Ok, 3:00pm on a Tuesday afternoon, got it. That’s not all though; searching a specific number of days from your flight is also necessary for getting the lowest price. Search at the earliest 3 months before your flight, and at the latest 18 days before your flight. It has been determined that the best deals are posted for flights about 6 weeks prior to their takeoff, so aim for about a month and a half before your trip to search for plane tickets.  Looking for flights on single airlines may be the easiest, but you may have better results if you look into flying on multiple airlines. Try taking one airline to your destination, and a separate one from. Or, include a layover with another airline mid-flight. Breaking up your trip and splitting it between carriers is likely to save you money, which is worth the extra time and hassle it will cost you., You need your flight, a hotel, and a shuttle to and from each? Rather than spending time organizing each item separately, save money and time by booking them together. Although it may seem like a good way to spend more money, studies show that you actually save money by booking multiple travel items at once in a package deal.  If you’re a frequent flier, chances are you’ve gathered quite a load of frequent flier miles. These miles are redeemable for, as they suggest, free miles on an airplane to a destination of your choice. Sign up for a frequent flier card via your favorite carrier, or keep track of your miles with an air miles program. With enough saved up, you may even get a free flight!  , That’s right, student discounts go beyond the movie theater and football games these days. Sites like statravel.com focus on finding flights at a discounted rate for students only. Don’t let the high prices of textbooks and tuition prevent you from travelling any longer; keep up with student discounted flights and head off on your adventures whenever you’d like.

"During the active growing season, which is generally spring through summer, try to support your plants by feeding them every fortnight (which is every 14 days). Start doing this as soon as the first buds appear on the plant.  A general water-soluble plant feed or one that your rake into the soil is fine. This encourages the plant to produce flowers. You can purchase plant feed at your local gardening supply store.  You should make a point to water your tubers just after planting, as mentioned above. Continue to water your new plants once every 10 to 14 days. When the first foliage, or leaves, appear on your plants, you should try to water them once a week.Continue watering your plants once a week until fall comes around. In the fall, the ranunculus will die back, or go dormant, and will not need to be watered. Dormancy is covered more thoroughly in Step 5 of this section.  Sadly, ranunculus can fall prey to pests like slugs and aphids. Luckily, there are measures you can take to make sure that these pests stay away.  Combat slugs with slug pellets, which are sprinkled around your ranunculus. You can purchase these pellets at a garden supply store.  A standard aphid spray or insecticidal soap should be applied if aphid attack occurs.  As with many flowering plants, it’s advisable to remove spent flowerheads once they wither (when they dry up and die). This not only makes the plant look tidier, it also encourages other flowers to form and reduces the amount of energy the plant spends on seed formation, which helps preserve its strength.  Use a sharp pair of scissors to snip off the dead heads as soon as they begin to look scruffy. Try to cut the flower at the base of the stem, which is located in amongst the foliage, or leaves.  Once the flowering season ends in fall, allow the foliage to die back. Dying back means that the plant becomes dormant until the next flowering season.To encourage the plant to regrow the next season:  Refrain from cutting the dead growth away before the first frost. You don’t need to water the plant while it is dormant; in fact, these plants do better if they are not watered while they are dormant in the winter.  Ranunculus will tolerate a light frost if left in the ground through a fairly mild winter. If your local climate regularly experiences heavy frost then dig up the tubers and store them in a cool dark place such as a garden shed for the winter.  Try to avoid bringing them into a heated space like your home as they tend to rot under these conditions.  Because of the difficulty establishing ranunculus as perennials (plants which flower year after year), many gardeners just treat them as annuals (plants which flower only one year). However, if you are determined to see yours bloom again, dig up your tubers for the winter, as described in the previous step.  Ranunculus make a beautiful cut flower that generally remains healthy for awhile after being cut if measures are taken to preserve the cut. To preserve the life of cut ranunculus flowers, cut them early in the morning just as the buds are starting to open.  A good clean cut using a sharp blade will help make the cut clean. Snip the stem at the base of the plant just about the crown and within the foliage. This avoids leaving exposed cut stems.  ","feed your plants with ‘plant feed’ every 14 or so days. water your ranunculus. defend your ranunculus against pests. remove withered flowerheads with sharp garden scissors. allow your plant to ‘die back’ in the winter. store the ranunculus inside during the winter if you live in a climate that gets heavy frost. understand that many gardeners view ranunculus as annuals. preserve blooms that you cut.

"Does he or she share ever detail of his or her life, no matter how mundane? Does he or she pressure you to like every single post that he or she makes? Take time to think about why your friend bothers you so much before proceeding.;  , It's inadvisable to confront your friend online about issues like these, because misunderstandings could happen online. Instead, it's best to wait until you can see your friend face-to-face. If need be, you could call your friend, or send an email explaining that you want to talk, but do not give any details other than that.  Be polite yet direct. You could say: 'I've enjoyed being your friend on Facebook, but I would also appreciate it if you could please stop (whatever is bothering you). (Explain why that behavior is bothering you)'. For instance, if your friend is pressuring you to like every single post that he or she makes, you could say 'I've enjoyed being your friend on Facebook, but I would also appreciate it if you could please stop pressuring me to like every single post that you make. I have liked several of your posts, but I have other friends on Facebook and their posts appear on my news feed, too, and I don't have time to check for your posts all day'.  If the behavior continues, you could ask to see your friend again in person. This time, be a little more direct with him or her, but remain polite as usual. For example, you could say: 'The last time we talked, I asked you to stop (doing whatever what is bothering you). I'm not sure why you ignored my request, but please heed it from here on forth'.

"These are listed below under 'Things You'll Need'.  Where the eggs don't cover up, this is what will be noticed. Pin into place.  Plan out the pattern for placing the eggs around the wreath before you start gluing them on. The specific arrangement will be dependent on a few things:  Color scheme: You might like to arrange the eggs so that they're all certain colors, one color, a pattern of colors, etc.  Size: If you only have one size of artificial egg, this won't be an issue. However, if you've purchased big, medium and small eggs, you might like to create a cascading effect that has the egg arrangement descending from large eggs on the outside to smaller ones on the inside.  Placement of other Easter items: If you're also inserting other Easter decorative elements, plan these in now. They might be inserted in between the eggs, or stuck on top of them.  Use the ribbon to make a loop for hanging. This now becomes the top of the wreath.  Add any embellishments at this stage too.  If you have a sign that says 'Easter' or has a bunny/chick, etc. on it, this could be glued into the center of the wreath, or added wherever it looks best. Just be careful to ensure good balance.

On any of the above devices, you have the option of selecting a 'normal' or 'sensitive' sleep setting. If you want a more basic idea of your general sleep patterns, select normal. The sensitive sleep setting will cause your device to track nearly all your movements as time 'spent awake' and can give you a great understanding of how active you are in your sleep. , The different sleep states indicate your activity level while sleeping. These can be useful for people with sleep disorders and to understand how restful your sleep is. The frequency of your movement will also be used to calculate your 'Sleep efficiency' which is calculated using the formula: 100* time asleep (time asleep + time restless + time awoken during sleep). A restful position would mean your movement is minimal and your tracker will indicate your body was fully asleep.  A restless state sleep will show up on your graph to indicate small movements common in tossing and turning.  If you move too much, your tracker may show you were awake, even if you weren't fully conscious and aware. This will show up in your sleep efficiency calculation as awake.

"For the salad, you’ll need 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts that have already been cooked. Use a sharp knife to chop the chicken into ½-inch (1.27-cm) cubes, and set aside for the moment.If you don’t have leftover chicken breasts, you can use store-bought rotisserie chicken, remove the meat from the bone, and chop it into pieces.;  , Place 1 ripe avocado that’s been seeded and peeled into a large bowl. Use a fork to mash the avocado until it is mostly smooth.It’s important to work quickly as you mash the avocado and begin to mix the salad. Avocado can brown very quickly.  Once you’ve mashed the avocado, add 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of lime juice to the bowl. Use the fork to stir the juice into the avocado until they are well blended.Adding the lime juice helps keep the avocado from browning because the acid in the juice helps lower the avocado’s pH.  After you’ve combined the avocado and lime juice, add half a small onion that’s been chopped, 8 grape tomatoes that have been sliced in half, and the diced chicken to the bowl. Use the fork to toss all of the ingredients together so they’re lightly coated with the avocado mixture.If there are other vegetables that you’d like to add to the salad, such as chopped celery, mix them in with onion and tomatoes.  When the salad is fully mixed, add as much salt as you like to season it. You can eat the avocado chicken salad straight from the bowl or use it as a filling for sandwiches.Store any leftover salad in the refrigerator in an airtight container.

"Regardless of whether you're exercising inside or outside, choose an activity you genuinely enjoy. One reason people struggle to work out in the winter is that their exercise of choice isn't an option in the colder months. If you, for example, love running, you may struggle to do so in below freezing temperatures. Try to find a new activity that you enjoy.Take this as a chance to experiment a little. You want to diversify your workout routine, and winter is a chance to do so. Take a chance at trying a variety of new activities.  For example, try skiing if you've never tried it before. If you prefer to stay warm in doors, take a class at your local gym. Try a dance-based exercise class, for example.;  , Weather is often the reason people taper off working out during the winter. Therefore, find something you enjoy that you can do indoors. There are a variety of workout routines you don't need to leave your home to do.Try enrolling in a class at your gym or at a local community center. You can try something like tai-chi, yoga, or Pilates.  If you love doing something like biking or running, try using a treadmill or stationary bike at your gym. If you go for long walks during the warmer months, try walking at a local mall during the winter.  Many people enjoy playing outdoors in the winter. Certain activities can actually burn calories. If it's too cold to make it to your gym on any given day, try going outside and enjoying the weather as a form of working out.You can do things like make snowmen, make snow angels, go snowshoeing, or other winter activities.  If you have kids, try spending a day in the snow with your children instead of going to your gym if it's very cold out.  If you don't like working out indoors, take winter as a chance to try winter sports. Things like skiing, snowshoeing, and even running outside are all options. See winter as a way to force yourself to try new things.You can see if there are classes for winter sports in your area. Taking a skiing class can be a fun way to stay active over the winter.  Sticking to a workout routine requires goals. You can see winter as the beginning of another season. Just as you may set a weight loss or fitness goal for the new year, set some goals for winter.The best goals are reasonable and specific. If your goals are vague or over-the-top, you're likely to get frustrated and not stick to them.  For example, you may have a goal along the lines of, 'I want to lose some weight before the new year.' This is an acceptable goal, but it's a little vague. Try to specify. For example, 'I want to lose 8 pounds by New Year's Eve.'  , Finding a workout buddy can help you stick to a routine. You will have another person to keep you accountable. Try pairing up with a friend to go skiing three times a week, or agreeing to go for a winter hike with your spouse each weekend.It's a good idea to pick a very motivated workout buddy. This way, their enthusiasm will rub off on you.  If you can't find a workout buddy in person, try finding an online workout partner.  Working out can be tiring and stressful. Many people make excuses as to why they can't complete a routine. This can be particularly easy to do in the winter, when the weather gives you an easy out. Make a habit of recognizing and challenging your own excuses.Remind yourself that your health and fitness does not take a vacation. Even though it's winter, your body still needs a routine.  Recognize when you're making an excuse and challenge it. For example, you may think something like, 'It's so cold. I can't walk to the gym in this weather.' Counter this excuse with something like, 'I can wear layers and, even though the walk will be rough, I can make it to the gym.'  , Sometimes, things do happen. A snow day could leave your gym closed. Very low temperatures could make a winter run dangerous. In these scenarios, have a Plan B.Say you usually go to a gym. Have a few at-home workout routines on hand in case the weather closes your gym, or if it's too dangerous to drive. You can even get some small home workout equipment, like free weights, to use at home.  You can also find guided exercise routines to follow online. There may be a YouTube video, for example, of a half hour aerobics routine you could follow.  Say you generally go running outside, even in the winter. If it gets too cold to run outside, you can run on a treadmill instead.  Try to get excited about working out over the winter. Instead of viewing it as a burden, remember everything you're gaining. You are keeping your health and weight intact even when it's cold outside.Also, look into the fun things about working out in the winter. You can have a cup of warm cocoa in front of the fireplace after a vigorous workout, for example.  You should always warm up before a workout, but this is especially important during the winter. A 10 minute warm up prior to a workout is important. Warming up usually means doing a less strenuous form of your chosen exercise first. For example, walk briskly for 10 minutes before running., You want to make sure you stay warm when working out outside in the winter. Layering is the best way to assure you're warm without having an outfit that inhibits your movement.Use a synthetic material for your first layer so that it will absorb sweat. Then, cover with layers of wool and fleece. Top off your layers with something waterproof.  Avoid cotton. This gets wet easily, and you want to make sure you don't get too sweaty when working out in the winter.  You will need to seek help fast in the event of frostbite and hypothermia. You should get out of the cold if you notice either and seek medical care if necessary.Frostbite usually occurs on exposed skin. You may feel numb or experience a stinging sensation. You should warm up the frostbitten area without rubbing it, as this can hurt the skin. If normal feeling does not return, see a doctor.  Loss of coordination, slurred speech, fatigue, and intense shivering are signs of hypothermia. Go to the emergency room if you notice any signs.  You may not feel the need to drink much water, or wear sunscreen, during colder months. However, you still need protection from the sun even if it's cold out. You also may not feel thirsty if it's cold outside, but you still need to hydrate as you lose fluids when working out.Even if you don't feel thirsty, drink water. Carry a water bottle with you and takes sips on occasion when working out.  Cover most of your skin to avoid too much sun exposure. Put sunscreen on areas of your body not covered by your clothing.

"Avoid doing work that’s easy so that you can slack off. Instead, volunteer for the most difficult (and important) assignments. If you want to be indispensable, you can’t fly under the radar., You want to be the go-to person for certain skills. For example, your department might use a lot of PowerPoint presentations. Become the person most knowledgeable at troubleshooting PowerPoint.  Begin by analyzing your colleagues. What skill do they monopolize? If one of them leaves, you can take over their task.  Also look for new opportunities at work. For example, your business might bring on a new client in a new industry. Volunteer to work on the account. You’ll be one of the few people in your organization with knowledge of the client and industry.  Instead of becoming territorial, you should welcome the arrival of younger colleagues.

Any employee who resists change will be swept out of the workforce faster than someone who is willing to try something new. Resist the urge to cling to old ways of doing things.Instead, be open and flexible.  Often, people resist change out of fear. However, you’re probably already afraid of becoming less relevant at your job, so you have little to lose.  You might also be afraid of making mistakes. Nevertheless, everyone who tries something new makes errors along the way. Use this as an opportunity to show your boss that you are still open to receiving criticism.

Make sure they don't get too sweaty though because otherwise they will be uncomfortable. Also make sure everyone has gone to the bathroom. Before you leave, go through the luggage once more to make sure you haven't forgotten anything.  Also brinks snacks and some drinks.

"When you show your boat to potential buyers, you want it to look as roomy and spacious as possible. You also want a buyer to be able to imagine his own gear on the boat, to really make it his own. Leaving your own things in the boat will add clutter and make it hard for the buyer to imagine the boat as his own., Be thorough and scrub every inch of your watercraft before you try to sell it. A dirty boat might turn off potential buyers, and even if the buyer is still interested it will be difficult to get your asking price. Try to make your boat look brand new, and your potential buyers will be impressed.Clean any carpets and upholstery on your boat. Nothing makes a boat look worse than shabby floors and seating.Wipe down the cabinets, lockers, and every other storage area onboard your boat., If you let a professional take a look at the boat, he can tell you about any repairs that the boat may need in the near future. Making those repairs in advance can help you get a better price for your boat. However, some boat brokers recommend holding off on replacing electronics, as sellers typically don't get a very big return on electronics upgrades., If your boat's coat is faded or scratched, it may need some minor touch ups, or even a whole new coat. Pay special attention to the bottom (if it's painted) and the outboard and stern drive skegs.If painting the hull, stick with basic boat hull colors like white or dark-blue. Buyers don't want any funky surprises when they see the boat's colors., No one wants to buy a rusty boat. Even if it's just a few minor spots, treating the rust beforehand can make your boat much more appealing to potential buyers.Use a spray-on rust converter to treat the rust. Apply a coat of paint over any rusted areas that need to be painted., You'll want the coat to look sleek and waxed when you take pictures and show the boat to interested parties. Some boaters recommend using spray-on furniture wax for a short time shine, but you can also buy wax that's made for boats that will stay on longer and look sleeker., Even a clean boat can start to smell a little stale if the windows and hatch are shut for a few days. Open things up and let the cabin air out. If an interested party comes to view your boat in person, he'll notice the difference., Before a potential buyer comes to see the boat, have all your paperwork in order. Keep the title, registration, warranty (if you have one), and any recent service/repair receipts in a single place, like a folder or binder. It will make things easier for you if the interested party decides to buy your boat, and it will make you look like an organized, responsible seller., In some places, the local or regional government requires all boat sellers to prepare a bill of sale for the buyer. Some laws even require the bill of sale to be notarized. This helps the buyer prove his ownership, and lets him have a record of the transaction in case he needs it in the future. Find out what your local and regional requirements are regarding a boat's transfer of ownership., In many places, the seller is required by law to notify his local authorities, in the Department of Licensing, Department of Wildlife, or other outdoor recreation-related agency, of any boat's sale or transfer of ownership. Some laws require swift notification, giving the seller as few as five days to notify the proper agencies about the boat's transfer of ownership. Find out in advance which agency or agencies you're required to notify, and obtain all the necessary paperwork in advance to help expedite the process., There are many, many websites that allow sellers to connect with potential buyers online. A website like Craigslist allows you to advertise to a broader range of people, but a specialty site like Boat Trader, for example, may help you reach a more targeted audience who know more about boats and are willing to pay more money for certain features.  Boat listings with photographs included are always viewed more than listings without any pictures.Be thorough when photographing the boat. Try to give potential buyers a digital tour of the boat: include multiple views and different angles of the front, sides, back, deck, and cabin.Don't include anything that won't come with the boat in the photographs. For this reason (and for general appearances), it's best to remove any clutter from your boat and from the area around your boat where you'll be photographing. If your boat is parked on a trailer in your yard, mention in the add whether or not the trailer is included, or if it's for sale at an additional price. Failure to mention these specifics, or failure to remove items from the boat that aren't included, could be construed as a misrepresentation by potential buyers.Show your boat in action. If possible, have someone take a photograph of your boat cruising away from the dock. This gives a potential buyer some idea of how well the boat performs, and lets that buyer imagine the boat as something he or she could drive.Capture your boat's best angles. Look at some professional boat listings online and take note of what angles the professional sellers shoot from when photographing their boats. This may take a bit of research and some experimentation on your end, but in the end you will have your own stunning, professional-quality photographs to help sell your boat.Help illustrate size and dimensions. You don't need to use a boat load of gear for this, as that will only clutter up the photograph. But you can, for example, have someone take a photograph of you extending measuring tape inside the cabinets or storage areas, or across the inside cabin, to help potential buyers see what your boat's real dimensions are.Capture your boat's finer details. Offer close-up shots of any parts of your boat that you think might help persuade potential buyers, such as the boat's motor or the controls around the steering wheel.Make sure the lighting is right (but not so bright that it's blinding). Try taking photographs with the sun behind you, rather than staring into the sun, as this will only silhouette your boat and could cast unwanted gleams of light off of your boat. If you can, try photographing your boat on a slightly cloudy day, as this will ensure that the sky will still light up your boat but the sun won't create an annoying glare.Some websites have specific requirements for the size and file type of photographs. Boat Trader, for example, requires photographs to be .jpg files less than 100K in size.Know what the specific requirements are for any sites you intend to advertise your boat on.  Chances are an educated boat buyer will want to know details like the overall size of the boat, the engine hours, and details about the motor (if it has one). Having that information up front, and including it in your advertisement, will help you secure a sale faster and with greater ease.  Include a thorough history of the boat. Mention in the advertisement any repairs, upgrades, and general maintenance you've put into the watercraft. If you bought it used, include what you know about the previous owner's maintenance and repairs., You'll want to do your research in advance to know what the going rate is for a boat that's as old and has as much wear and tear as your boat. You should also determine your absolute bottom price beforehand as well.The NADA, BUC, and ABOS pricing guides are a good place to start, but you should also check the prices of similar boats for sale at your local boat dealers, in classified ads, and online.  Know whether you're willing to hold out for the right price. It could take time to find someone willing to pay your top asking price, which means time that you'll be paying for for storage and continued maintenance.You may need to be flexible on the asking price. Some experts recommend pricing a boat at least five percent cheaper than the lowest-priced boat of your boat's make and age to ensure a speedy sale.Don't let potential buyers know what your bottom price is before they've seen the boat. If an interested party calls you on the phone or emails you and asks how low you're willing to go, tell him you'd like him to see the boat before he starts trying to negotiate a better price. If you've done your work cleaning, prepping, and polishing the boat, it should speak for itself.As you collect prices for comparable boats, save copies of this info to show potential buyers.  Ultimately, the price is up to you. You'll need to decide how much time and effort you're willing to put into making a sale.  Interested parties will almost certainly ask you why you're selling the boat. They may be making conversation, or they may be trying to test you to see if there are any problems with the boat. Boating experts generally recommend telling interested parties that you're looking for a change in lifestyle: a different boat, a bigger boat, or even a smaller boat are all common reasons why someone might sell a boat. You don't need to lie to sellers, just know in advance what to say so you're not caught off guard if they do ask., Sometimes when you're selling something online, you'll get a lot of nibbles before anyone commits to an actual purchase. Whether they're just feeling out the water, so to speak, or they find something better along the way, anticipate that some of the interested parties will back out or completely flake out of the deal before they've even seen the boat., Some interested parties may wish to take the boat out for a ride-along before committing to a final sale. If this won't be possible for any reason, let the interested party know. If you can arrange to take the boat out with the potential buyer, limit how many people come along (ideally just the buyer and his or her partner, if it's a couple). This will help ensure that the boat rides smoother and faster, and it will help the boat feel less cramped if there are only one or two people with you.If an interested party has asked in advance about taking the boat out, get there early and start the engine to let it warm up for a half hour to an hour. This will help get the engine ready and will let you know if there are any problems, like a dead battery, before the buyer shows up., Some sellers are wary of checks (even banker's checks), as there's no guarantee that the money will be there when you try to cash the check. Getting cash in-hand, and counting that cash before the seller leaves, is the only way to be 100% certain that you'll get money from the buyer.

October is Down Syndrome Awareness Month., The Down Syndrome awareness ribbon is blue and yellow, and you can buy a Down Syndrome shirt or make your own outfit. Colorful socks (three pairs) are used to symbolize the three pairs of chromosomes., Disabled people need resources, acceptance, inclusion, and self-determination. Find bills that are promoted by the disability community (not just parents—actual disabled people too). Try organizing a letter-writing campaign or educating people on the internet.  You can work in conjunction with other groups of disabled people, such as Deaf and Autistic self-advocates.  Many people with Down Syndrome have heart issues, stomach problems, eyesight issues, and other health problems. They are more likely to face Alzheimer's and dementia as they age. You can help by advocating for funding for these medical issues, and donating to organizations that help people get the surgeries and treatments they need.

"Part of being a good observer is remembering details. This includes remembering everything from locking your door before you leave your house to the color of the car you parked beside. Since our brains filter a lot of that irrelevant information out, make a conscious effort to start committing simple details to memory. It will help you improve your memory while making you a better observer of your surroundings.  As you leave your house, tell yourself, 'I turned off the stove. I locked the door.' This will help you commit it to memory. This technique also helps you start observing small, every day tasks.Use memory games like concentration. The memory skills you want to develop for strengthening observation skills are the ones connected to the senses. Sight is especially important. Show yourself pictures, then close your eyes and try to remember what you observed in the photo. Walk through the city and remembering what you smelled. Try to replay conversations from the day each evening to see how much of the dialog you can remember word for word.  One reason that people are not as observant as they should be is because they are distracted. Cell phones, music, a to-do list - there are a lot of reasons why people are distracted daily. Try getting rid of distractions so you can focus on your surroundings.Remove your headphones when you walk or are on the train. Listen to the sounds around you, including conversations. Don't just look at the objects around you, consciously observe them. By not being distracted, you will be aware of everything around you and remember it more easily.  Focus on the television show or movie you are watching and listen closely to songs. Instead of mindlessly watching or listening, pay attention to them. Think about costuming choices in the show or movie, or why the director chose a particular way to set up a shot. Look at the props, especially the background, and see what you can observe and deduce about the characters, themes, or plot. Try to figure out the meaning of song lyrics as you listen., Observation is a very scientific approach to the world. By keeping a field journal, you are recording your observations. This can be about anything; the important thing is to observe everything around you and strengthen your observation skills.  Start by going to a park with a notebook. Jot down what you see around you. Make sure to note specifics, like the color of the shirts people are wearing, the birds flying overhead, the sounds. Begin trying to figure out what are important details and which details are not as important.  Use this field observation in other aspects of your life. How many times does the guy in the cubicle next to you get up to talk on his cell during the day? How many times does a customer pick up an item before they buy it? What color shirt do most people wear on the bus?  Take these observations and begin to draw conclusions. For examples, customers don't pick up food items multiple times before buying them; they pick them up and set them on the counter. Customers pick up beauty products five times before making a decision to buy it. Your boss always wears a blue shirt on Mondays, and green shirt on Thursdays.Use this journal to outline irregularities in your day. Think about irregular sounds or events that happen around you. Being a good observer means being able to pick out things that are out of the ordinary., Part of observing is coming to conclusions. Practice observing the world and analyzing what that means. Don't just observe without doing anything with the information.  If you see a frazzled mother in a store with her teenage daughter, then spot college brochures inside her purse, you can come to the conclusion that she is stressed because her daughter is about to go to college.  If you see a man with a stain on his shirt, and then see the car seat in his backseat, you can conclude that the stain was a baby-related accident.  Meditation is a great exercise for strengthening observation skills. It helps you clear your mind of clutter and distractions so you can focus.  Spend 10-15 minutes a day relaxing. Get in a quiet room, or turn on quiet instrumental music. Breathe in and out and push all thought from your mind. Focus on everything around you, like the sounds and the smells.  ","improve your memory. eliminate distractions. keep a field journal. form connections between what you see. meditate. "
"Many flowers will work well for a floating floral arrangement but it's best to choose ones that will hold their shape nicely. For example, camellias, irises and roses work well.  Cut up as high as possible without endangering the bud and petals., You'll need a bowl or wide raised platter that is elegant and able to hold water. It should have sufficient space to fit the amount of flowers you wish to add. Ideally, the item needs to be shallow without allowing the water to fall out.  Glass bowls are very pretty for floating floral arrangements.  Keep the amount as low as possible, so as not to swamp the flowers., It is also nice to add a few leaves, especially fragrant leaves such as mint, pine or lemon balm leaves.  If you like, add some essential or scented oil to the water. This is only where the flowers chosen aren't sufficiently scented themselves.  It's that easy to do, so there's no need for more fuss.

"It's near impossible for anyone to give you a fair shake if you are being fake, trying to pretend to like the things the sister likes when it's clear you're as different as night and day. While it's difficult to act naturally at first, affecting a completely different personality from the beginning is immature and misleading.;  , Rope your boyfriend into helping you out. Ask him about her favourite books, movies, TV shows, etc. Ask what she likes to do, for example: Does she like to ski, take pictures, shop - what? What kind of music does she listen to? Has she got any unusual hobbies? Think of this as research. It's always nice if you can strike up a conversation about something you're already well aware that she has interest in. This will tell her that you bothered to ask her brother about her, and therefore that you are interested in getting to know her.  Have you got anything in common with her? If you have, aim to bring her into a conversation about it. For example, if you both like the same band, you could say, 'Did you see their gig last month? What did you think of it?'.  Tell your boyfriend that you're nervous about meeting his sister and that you don't want to cause her to feel that you're intruding or impacting their special relationship in any way. It will give him a chance to reassure you about her and to perhaps suggest some smart tactics for dealing with any particular quirks, preferences or attitudes she might present to you.  Ask him about how his sister has been toward former girlfriends. You might be able to build up a picture of her prior behavior to help you.  Assume the best and expect that things will go well. They may not but you can remain the better person by not stooping to any level of negativity she might wish to introduce.  Another example: If she's an avid DIYer, ask, 'I've been thinking about painting my living room, but I'm not sure whether I could just paint over my wallpaper or whether I'll have to strip it. What do you think?'  , No one wants to hear the unabridged version of your life; however, by being open and light you are encouraging the same in return. Even if the two of you hit it off completely, don't lose control and start pouring out everything to her. You risk saying something you didn't want known this early; and furthermore, you will have less to say on the next visit!  , Having his whole family around her could make it feel like a 'me against all of them' situation. Can you invite her out somewhere?  , No one, especially the family, needs to see displays of your physical interaction. She will feel uncomfortable and possibly resentful, because it will seem as though you are attempting to control his attention. Once you leave, you can do whatever you like.  If you like her, that's great; however, if you sense that there is tension, do your best to remove yourself from the situation and calmly discuss it with your boyfriend. Make sure that you do not make it sound as though you are blaming his sister. See if he has any explanation for her behavior.  If she doesn't start showing any signs of accepting you, you need to find some sort of middle-ground or understanding with your boyfriend as to how to handle things. Inform him that you will defend yourself if needed but you won't be provoking anything. It doesn't do to be a doormat just because she's of his family––once that's established, it'll never stop.  If the two of you have not hit it off, whenever you see her, be friendly but brief. There's nothing wrong with being civil.

"The simplest item to use would be a plastic identification card, license, credit card, or library card. These plastic cards are usually about 1 mm thick from front to back.A plastic card is probably the easiest item to use. Other items that are approximately 1 millimeter in length or width tend to be more difficult to work with, but may include a grain of salt or sand, 10 sheets of notebook paper stapled together, the thickness of one sheet of heavy printer paper, the thickness of a fingernail, the thickness of a grain or rice, and the thickness of a U.S. dime.  Lay the edge or line you plan on measuring down on a sheet of white or light colored paper. Try to keep the entire edge on the paper.  If desired, you can use a pencil to trace along the outside of the edge. This allows you to remove the object being measured and work only with a flat line, which can make measuring such small lengths easier. Doing so is only optional, however.  The paper needs to be light in color. If it isn't, you might have difficulty seeing your marks.  Use a pencil to carefully mark a perpendicular line off one side of the edge you are measuring. This will become your starting edge.  Place the narrow 1-mm edge of your plastic card down on the paper, placing it directly next to your starting edge line. Draw another small mark with your pencil on the opposite side of the card.  Keep the mark as close to the outer edge of your card as possible.  Note that you can use this procedure for any other estimation tool. It is not exclusive to plastic identification cards.  Shift the card so that it lies to the outside of your newly created mark, then draw another mark on the opposite side of the card again. Continue moving the card down the line in small increments like this, marking each one, until you reach the very end of the edge you are measuring.  Keep the card perpendicular to the line being measured the entire time you measure out the marks.  Make sure that the ending edge of the line is also marked.  Remove the edge being measured and the card you are using the measure it. Count the gaps in between each line you marked. The number of gaps will give you your estimated number of millimeters.  Only count the gaps. Do not count the lines, since there will be one too many.  ","find an item roughly 1 millimeter long. place the object to be measured on a blank sheet of paper. mark the starting edge. place your measuring item at the starting edge. move the measuring item down the full length. count the gaps.

"Use exfoliating shower gel to clean off the grime. Turn the water to hot to start the shower (because it cleans you more effectively), but towards the end of your shower, turn the water to a lukewarm or cool setting. This lowers your body temperature to make you feel cooler (and wakes you right up in the morning!).;  , A great trick is to use baby oil instead of the normal lotions. While you're still damp, rub small amounts all over your body. If you prefer scented lotions, use something light. Opt towards citrus or flowers for a nice crisp scent. Heavy scents like Vanilla or Coconut can make you feel warm. Bath and Body works has lots of nice scents (Sweet Pea and Cucumber Melon are ideal for summer), and they usually have coupons and sales.  Sweat and oil can accumulate and clog your pores, making your face feel dirty and heavy. A good exfoliating cream and a light moisturizer should do the trick  , Ponytails always work. Be sure to wash your hair at least once a week (or however often you need to for your hair type) to keep your scalp clean and healthy.  You should do this at least twice a day anyway. A fresh, clean mouth can make your tongue feel cooler. Minty toothpastes and gum are good to use during the summer to help you feel cool.  Remember: the lighter the color the less heat it attracts, so try to choose brighter colors like white, pink, yellow and orange. The weight of the fabric is also important to consider, so silk shirts will keep you cooler than denim.  When doing outdoor sports/activities, bring plenty of cold water or Gatorade and try to stay in the shade as much as possible. A small fan or a spray bottle can help you avoid heat exhaustion too, if you want.  The water and vitamins in fruit will treat you much better than the sodium in those savory treats.  This can make your house feel several degrees cooler and help you avoid turning on the air conditioner, which draws a lot of power.  ","shower every day. moisturize right after you step out of the shower. make sure to clean your face regularly. style your hair so that it's off your neck and away from your face. brush your teeth. wear shorts, skirts, loose/flowing tops, tanks, flip-flops and sandals. be sure to drink plenty of water to stay hydrated, especially if you're going to be outside. choose refreshing, fresh fruit snacks such as watermelon, grapefruit, oranges and strawberries instead of normal snack food, like a bag of chips. open windows at night to let in the cool air and breezes, but keep windows closed and blinds drawn during hot, sunny days.

"It's very important your fantail goldfish has a big enough tank. You should get a tank over a bowl, as bowls get dirty too fast. This can cause sickness and even death. Make sure you get a large tank at your local pet shop. Keep in mind that although keeping goldfish are quite easy, it takes quite some money to provide the right conditions for them.You will need at least 10 to 20 gallons per fish. Bigger is usually better, if you have the space and money. Fish with bigger tanks will be happier and live longer. Opt for the largest tank you can afford and fit in your home.;  , Fantail goldfish are fairly hardy, so if the water falls a little out of this range, they will usually be okay. However, strive to keep the water between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. This is the best temperature rate for the health of your fish.You can use a thermometer to monitor water temperature. Room temperature should usually be in the 70 to 80 degree range, but may be warmer or colder depending on your region.  In general, the temperature may get a little warmer or colder than ideal, but most fantail goldfish can survive this. Just make sure not to let the water get under 60 degrees or into the triple digits.  However, if you live in a region where temperatures drop overnight, a heater is a good idea. If room temperature can get into the low 60's and even 50's, buy a heater at your local pet store and install it in your tank. Set the heater somewhere between 70 and 80 degrees., A filtration system is an important aspect of any fish tank, including a tank for your fantails. Buy a filter from your local pet shop designed to be used in a goldfish tank. Avoid filters that cause a lot of current in your tank, as this is bad for your goldfish. Goldfish do not do well in tanks with heavy currents., Once a week, remove and replace 10%-15% of the water in the tank. There is no need to remove your fish during a 10 to 15% water change. When you clean the tank, simply scoop out about 10 to 15% of the water and replace it with dechlorinated tap water.In addition to replacing the water, do some basic cleaning. Scrape any algae growing at the bottom of the tank. You can get an algae scraper at a local pet store to do this.  When replacing water in the tank, make sure the water is close to the tank's temperature. The easiest way to add new water is to place dechlorinated tap water in a bucket, and gradually siphon the new water from the bucket to the tank. You can use tubing, which you can purchase at a pet store or online, to siphon the water.  To dechlorinate water, you will need to purchase chemical neutralizers online or at your pet store. You will have to refer to your dechlorinator's label for specific instructions, but for the most part you'll add a drop or two of the dechlorinator to a gallon of water. Most dechlorinators work in a minute or two.  You can find food for your fantails at a local pet shop. Pellets or flakes are usually the staple of a goldfish's diet, and should contain the nutrients your pet needs to thrive.In general, pellets may be better than flakes for goldfish. Flakes tend to crumble in the water, making them difficult to eat. Pellets may be more expensive, but they also may be better for your goldfish's overall health.  Check the labels when choosing a fish food. Make sure the food contains both protein and fat. In general, the higher percentages of protein and fat, the better.  Goldfish are omnivores, meaning they need both meat and vegetables. In addition to feeding your fantails a high quality fish food, give them high fiber veggies. This will help with their overall health.Get some tender aquarium plants for your fish tank. Place these plants in your tank so your goldfish can snack on plants from time to time.  Elodea works well as a snack for goldfish. While goldfish will eat things like pellets and flakes quickly, they will take longer to consume vegetables. This is normal. Do not worry if a plant is not completely eaten for a week or so.  As goldfish eat fast, people often accidentally overfeed them. It should not take your goldfish longer than 2 minutes to eat a serving of pellets or flakes. If your goldfish takes longer than this to finish its food, you're overfeeding it.You can refer to the pellet or flake package to get a sense of how much food your goldfish needs each day. Adjust the levels as necessary, depending on your fish's appetite.  If there is food leftover after two minutes have passed, reduce the amount you're feeding your fish. Goldfish may beg for food after being fed, but they generally get by on small servings.  Having plants in the tank can help the goldfish manage hunger between feedings.  Feed your goldfish around the same time each day. This will help you remember to feed your fish every day. When feeding your fish, remember that they only need a small amount of pellets or flakes. If the goldfish is still looking for food after finishing its pellets, you can add some plants to the tank. Do not overfeed the fish pellets or flakes., Remember, you need 10 to 20 gallons of water per fish. If you add a new fantail goldfish to your tank, you will need to increase the tank size accordingly. If your fish feel overcrowded, they may become aggressive and fight with one another., Even in a properly sized tank, some goldfish are simply more territorial than others. If one fish seems to be consistently chasing another, invest in a tank separator to manage conflict.You can buy a tank divider at a pet store. Install it in your tank so your fish cannot get to one another.  You can also buy a new tank altogether to correct this problem.  Uneaten food at the bottom of the tank can be a problem. Not only does this indicate you're overfeeding your fish, this could cause tank contamination. If you notice un-eaten food during a routine water change, remove it from the bottom of the tank. In the future, cut back on how much you're feeding your fish., Fantail fish can survive in a variety of temperatures. However, sharp increases or decreases in tank temperature can shock your fish's system. Take steps to assure the tank temperature remains relatively stable.Do not place a goldfish tank near a window. The air from outside can cause the tank temperature to rise or drop quickly.  Keep the tank in an area of your home where the temperature is stable. Watch for areas of the home prone to drafts, or that get warmer or colder during certain times of the day.  You should also quarantine any fish that appear unhealthy. This not only prevents the spread of disease, but allows you to closely monitor the sick fish and treat the illness without harming the other fish, plants, and invertebrates in your tank with medicines and chemicals. Signs of illness can include:Bloated body  Listlessness  White spots on the body  Rapid breathing  Bulging eyes  Hiding in the corner  ","pick the right size tank. keep the temperature between 70 and 80 degrees fahrenheit. install a filter. clean the tank each week. choose a high quality food. supplement your fish's diet with high fiber vegetables. refrain from overfeeding. establish a feeding schedule. avoid overcrowding. consider a separator if the fish become territorial. watch for uneaten food at the bottom of the tank. keep the tank temperature stable. watch for signs of illness.

"The biggest struggle with transitioning your hair is preventing breakage due to damage and dryness. Do what you can to keep your hair hydrated and conditioned by using a conditioner on a daily basis. Every evening before bed, thoroughly incorporate either coconut oil or olive oil into your hair and let is soak for 30 minutes to an hour. This will help replenish your hair with moisture and nutrients that will strengthen the demarcation line (the part of the hair where the transition is occurring).  To keep the shampoo from stripping moisture, try to wash your hair one to three times a week. On shampoo days, apply to the roots only so that you get the oil and debris at the scalp without stripping your strands. Then, condition as per usual.  Consider using a leave-in conditioner for your hair during the day. Apply some to your hair before you style it, paying careful attention to the demarcation line.;  , Deep conditioning treatments take adding moisture to a new level. Although they are typically only used once a month or so, transitioning hair needs extra conditioning and can handle the treatments more frequently. Purchase a deep-conditioning treatment from your local beauty supply store, and apply it to your hair once a week. Alternately, you can also choose to visit a salon and get deep-conditioning treatments regularly.  Follow the bottle instructions for your deep conditioner.  If you’re feeling frugal, another great alternative to a deep conditioner is using a bottle of mayonnaise. Although it sounds (and might smell) a bit unappealing, it can work wonders on adding moisture to your hair. Apply it to your hair once a week for 30 minutes to an hour.  If you decide to have a professional deep condition your hair, try looking for someone who specializes in transitioning hair. They’ll be able to provide you with products and services designed specifically to meet your needs.  In general, hot tools should be avoided if you’re trying to protect your hair. Using curling irons, flat irons, and blow driers can stress your hair and cause breakage, specifically at the demarcation line. While transitioning your hair, do all that you can to allow it to be as natural as possible. Avoid hot tools, and if necessary, limit their use to only one day a week at most.  This goes hand in hand with adding moisture to your hair; washing your hair frequently strips your strands of the natural oil that helps to keep it strong. Wash your hair as little as you can, using plenty of conditioner when you do. If you’re able, wash your hair once every 7-8 days so that there is plenty of time for your natural oils to thoroughly coat each strand of hair., Waiting for your hair to grow out is often the most frustrating part of the growing-process. Rather than waiting idly by, you can promote new hair growth by giving yourself frequent scalp massages. Use a bit of oil (coconut, olive, avocado, etc.) warmed slightly to massage your scalp. This will stimulate the hair follicles and help the strands to grow a bit faster. Hot oil massages can be done as frequently as you would like, but should be done at least once a week for the best results., Maintaining your vitamins and minerals is important to general health (in addition to hair health), but taking certain supplements can speed up hair growth and strengthen your hair extra fast. Doctors recommend taking biotin or viviscal - supplements specifically used for hair and nail growth - to increase the speed at which your hair is growing. Additionally, making sure you have enough vitamin D and A will help your hair out as well.  Some studies show that taking a saw palmetto supplement (derived from a small pine tree) can yield faster hair growth than taking nothing at all., Although it may seem like a given, you should be avoiding all relaxers and perms when trying to transition your hair. In addition, stay away from hair dyes and bleach, as these cause significant damage to your hair, causing it to break and become frizzy. Look for all natural alternatives to chemicals you typically use, as these will be much safer on your scalp and strands than harsh chemicals are.  As it turns out, not all hair products are created equally. With a huge variety on the market, it can be difficult to find products that will work with your hair and your wallet. When transitioning your hair though, it is vital to get transition-friendly hair supplies. Look for sulphate-free conditioning shampoos, as well as other hair treatments advertised specifically for use in transitioning hair. Although these won’t necessarily change the appearance of your hair, they will work hard to prevent further damage and reverse current damage in your locks.  If you go to a salon that specializes in transitioning hair, ask for recommendations in hair products.  If nothing else, find a sulfate-free shampoo. Sulfate (present in most cheap shampoos) causes significant drying of hair strands and it clogs up the pores of the scalp, reducing hair growth.  It is common for people transitioning their hair to go ahead and do the big chop - that is, cutting off all the relaxed hair, leaving a short amount of new growth near the scalp. This is certainly the best option for creating healthy growth, but not everyone wants their hair to be less than an inch long. If you’re bold enough to try a new look, the big chop is an excellent choice for immediately getting rid of all your relaxed hair, creating an immediate full transition to natural hair.  Relaxers are permanent, so whatever parts of your hair that have been in contact with a relaxer will never grow back naturally. Therefore, at some point in time your hair must be cut off to above the demarcation line. If you’re not willing to go for the big chop, the next step is to do regular trims of your hair. Start by cutting off a few inches of your hair, and then once a month cut off ¼-½ an inch of hair. Over time you’ll have removed all of the damaged, relaxed hair to above the demarcation line, allowing your natural hair to grow more strongly.  The first couple inches of new, natural growth can appear strange when juxtaposed next to your relaxed hair. In order to avoid damaging it further with tight styles, use accessories to hide your curly roots. Headbands and head scarves are popular options for hiding your roots while allowing the rest of your hair to show through.  Although tight cornrows can cause breakage, using loose cornrows, braids, and twists are a great way to add interest to your hair without damaging it. The most manageable transitioning hairstyles are box braids and Senegalese twists. These hairstyles include little to no hair manipulation and they give a lot of hair protection since the extension hair is covering your real hair. Mastering each style can be tricky, so spend some time finding which works best with your hair and personal stylistic preferences. The most important thing is to keep whatever style you use very loose, so as to avoid stressing the strands of hair.Your hair is most fragile at the demarcation line, so be particularly gentle when styling it around this point.  Many women can vouch for the importance of owning a good hair gel, pomade, or spray; with the right products, you can cover up even the most unsightly of hair styles. Sort through your styling products, and try using them (rather than a tight style with clips or elastic bands) to style your hair. You may like the results better, and it will be safer and more gentle on your fragile hair as well.  Although it can be tricky not to, the more you touch and style your hair, the more likely it is to break and become frizzy. Try not to brush your hair too often, and avoid styles that put strain on your scalp. If you do brush your hair, start from the bottom and work your way up using a comb (not a brush).  ","keep your hair hydrated. use a deep conditioner regularly. stay away from heat. limit your hair washings. give yourself a hot oil massage. promote hair growth with supplements. avoid adding chemicals to your hair. purchase new hair products. consider the ‘big chop’. trim your hair regularly. cover up your new growth. try using braids or twists. find a great styling product. avoid dealing with your hair too much.

"When you’re ready to remove your lashes, wet a cotton swab or pad with an eye makeup remover. Gently run the swab over the lash band where it’s attached to your eyelid to help loosen the adhesive.  It’s best to use an oil-free eye makeup remover because oils can leave behind residue that makes it difficult for lash adhesive to stick to the lashes the next time you use them.;  , After the eye makeup remover has started to loose the lash glue, start to pull up the edge of the lashes. Make sure to peel up from the outer corner of the lashes where they tend to come loose most easily.Use the pads of your fingers to peel off the lashes. Don’t use tweezers or your fingernails because they can rip the lashes or stretch out the band.  Once you have the outer corner free, pull the lash off toward the inner corner. Make sure to work slowly and carefully, so you don’t stretch the band or warp the lashes.  If there are any areas where the lashes are still stuck, take a fresh cotton swab and wet it with eye makeup remover so you can run it over the spot before continuing to pull on the lash.  When you’ve removed the lashes from your eyes, wet a cotton pad with eye makeup remover. Run the pad over the entire lash band to remove any eyeliner or mascara that may be on the lashes.  Clean both sides of the lash band to ensure that you remove all of the makeup residue.  If you’re using synthetic eyelashes, you can actually soak them in a little bit of eye makeup remover to help get rid of any makeup or other residue. Don’t soak mink or other natural false lashes, though, or you’ll damage them., After you’ve removed any makeup from the lashes, you should remove any remaining adhesive on the band. Hold the lashes between your forefinger and thumb, and gently pull at the adhesive with a pair of tweezers to remove.  If there is a thick layer of glue, you may be able to pull it off with your fingers.  In some cases, the adhesive will pull free in a single strip. In other case, you’ll need to pull it off in pieces.  To ensure that there is no bacteria on the lashes, it’s important to disinfect them before you wear them again. Dip a cotton swab in rubbing alcohol, and run it along both sides of the lash band to get rid of any bacteria and adhesive that may still be on the lashes.  If any adhesive is left on the lash bands, it may irritate your eyes the next time that you wear them so it’s important to get all of it off.  You don’t want to put your lashes away while they’re still wet or they may become damaged or moldy before your next use. Lay the lashes on a towel or piece of paper towel, and let them air dry for 15 or 20 minutes., To keep your lashes clean and dust-free for the next time that you wear them, it’s important to store them in a protective container. You don’t have to buy a special container, though -- save the plastic case that holds the lashes, as well as the tray with the half-moon shapes for the lashes to curl around.If you lose or misplace the packaging from your lashes, you can purchase reusable protective cases from beauty supply stores and online sites. They often hold more than one pair of lashes, so you can store all of your lashes in one place.  Take the dry lashes and place them on the half-moon trays, bending them gently to fit around the curve so they hold their shape. Next, place the tray inside the plastic case and close the container, so the lashes are protected from dust, dirt, and debris.  Once the lashes are in their packaging, it’s important to store them in the right spot. Heat and strong light can warp the lashes, so you should keep them in a cool, dark spot, such as a dresser drawer, until you want to apply them the next time.Avoid storing your eyelashes in the bathroom, which often gets hot and humid.

Don’t be afraid to approach new people. If you hear a group talking about something that interests you, such as football, join the conversation and offer your own input. For example, you might say, “Did you guys catch the game last night? That pass in the third quarter was insane.”  If new people reject you, don’t pout. Realize that they’re not the kind of people you need in your life anyway. Move on to a new group.  Take the initiative in your group of friends. Tough people are leaders because they’re not afraid to voice their opinions and make suggestions to others.If you know of an activity your friends might enjoy, bring it up to the group. Try to be specific. For example, if there’s a concert coming up, say, “Hey guys, let’s get tickets for the concert this weekend. They go on sale this afternoon so I’ll come by and pick you up so we can be first in line.”  Include everyone in your friend group. A good leader never leaves someone out. If you include everyone whenever you talk or make plans, everyone in your group will start to look up to you as tough and reliable.  Standing up for others and not taking abuse from others means that you might find yourself in a fight, even if you’re not looking for one. It’s important to learn how to defend yourself if someone attacks you.  Attend self-defense or martial arts classes. If your school doesn’t provide classes, try your local YMCA or other gym.  Remember that fighting should only be a last resort. A truly tough person is able to ward off fights and deflect tension before it escalates.  Being tough does not mean being a bully. Sometimes bullies put on tough attitudes, but this is just a façade. A truly tough person doesn’t need to belittle others to feel good about themselves.If you find yourself being a bully, or realize you’ve been a bully in the past, apologize. A willingness to take responsibility for your behavior is a hallmark of toughness. It shows that you’re not afraid of being wrong or deciding to do the right thing instead of going along with the crowd.  ","choose your friends wisely. be a leader. learn to defend yourself. don’t be a bully. "
"The vegetables you might grow in your home garden belong to several different families. Knowing these families and which plants belong to them is important for crop rotation because each family of plants depletes different ratios of nutrients from the soil. Crop rotation at its most basic level simply means avoiding growing plants from the same family in the same patch for consecutive seasons.  The nightshade family includes common homegrown plants like tomato, eggplant, potato, and bell pepper.  The gourd family includes all types of melons, pumpkins, and squash.  The legume family includes all types of beans, such as lima beans, snow peas, wax beans, and snap peas.  The carrot family contains carrots, parsley, celery, and parsnips.  The cole family includes many common leafy green vegetables. Common cole crops include broccoli, cabbage, kale, kohlrabi, radish, mustard greens, turnips, rutabaga, Brussels sprouts, and cauliflower.  The onion family includes onions, shallots, garlic, chives, and leeks.  The goosefoot family includes plants like beets, Swiss chard, and spinach.;  , Another key distinction for effective crop rotation is heavy versus light feeders. Heavy feeders are those plants that drain large amounts of nutrients from the soil in a single season. Light feeders are plants that use relatively low levels of nutrients. A third group of plants actually builds the soil's health by introducing atmospheric nitrogen into the ground.  Heavy feeders include plants such as corn, tomatoes, cabbage, cauliflower, and squash. Even when these plants belong to different families, you should avoid planting them in the same soil for successive seasons, as they will deplete the soil too rapidly.  Light feeders include potatoes, most root and bulb vegetables, and herbs.  Soil building plants are mostly limited to those in the legume family. These plants perform a process called nitrogen fixation by which they pull nitrogen from the atmosphere and introduce it into the soil for future plants to use.  After you have gained an understanding of the different types of plants, you can begin planning your garden for crop rotation. Map out your garden with a pencil and paper and divide it roughly into different beds (this will be very easy if you use raised beds). You can then use this bed diagram to determine which type of plant will be planted in each area over each season.  For example, consider a garden divided into beds A, B, C, and D. In the first growing season, you could plant nightshades in bed A, gourds in bed B, and legumes in bed C.  In the second season, you would plant your nightshades in bed B, gourds in bed C, and legumes in bed D. In the third and fourth seasons, plant nightshades in beds C and then D, gourds in D and A, and legumes in A and B.  The unused garden bed in each season would historically have been left fallow to allow the soil to recover. However, it is now known that planting cover crops such as clover or alfalfa in this bed will help keep the soil healthier.  The rigid plan presented above can be adjusted to your gardening needs. For example, you may want to grow many more plants in the nightshade family than any other plants. This can generally be accomplished by making the beds different sizes. The nightshades can be planted in the largest bed the first season and split into separate beds in successive seasons.  ","familiarize yourself with the different plant families. determine which crops are heavy feeders and which are light feeders. make a map of your garden on paper. adjust your crop rotation plan as necessary.

"When you are done, transfer it to a plate lined with paper towels so that it can drain.The bacon slices should be long enough to fit across your English muffin with hanging over the edge. If they are too long, cut the bacon into halves or thirds so that it fits.  You can also use a small croissant; you do not have to toast the croissant, however.If you'd like a larger breakfast, try a toasted bagel instead.  Heat the skillet for about 3 minutes over medium heat. Add ½ tablespoon of unsalted butter to the skillet, and let it melt.Gently move the skillet around to swirl the butter in it.  You can use a fork or a mini whisk to beat the egg. If you'd like, you can season the egg with some salt and pepper.

To get a perfect, round shape, use a pancake or egg ring; they are meant for frying pancakes and eggs into perfect circles.  You may have to fold the scrambled egg a little until it fits onto the muffin. Make sure that nothing is hanging over the muffin's edge.

"This method cooks the rice evenly, so the bottom and sides are much less likely to burn., On the stovetop, boil twice as much water as rice by volume. One cup (240 mL) uncooked rice is enough for 3–5 people.  Use vegetable or chicken broth instead for more flavor.  If your saucepan and lid are safe for oven use, you can use that. Otherwise, use a Dutch oven or casserole dish.  Long grain rice should be ready in about 35 minutes, but may take longer if your oven runs low.If your oven dish doesn't come with a lid, cover with a large piece of tin foil, or use a large oven-safe plate in a pinch.

"Take a deep breath and wait before speaking.Sometimes the person will move onto another topic without skipping a beat, saving you the trouble.  Giving yourself a moment allows you to think before you speak prevents you from overreacting or saying something you might later regret.Have some responses worked out ahead of time to the annoying questions you know you'll be asked.  Repeating what someone says to you is the best way to let them know they were heard.  Listening is a skill, and repeating what they say can show them not only what they said, but how it feels to hear those words., If your relative is being super annoying, try changing the subject or ask them a question, out of the blue.  When you do decide to speak, answer respectfully and only to the detail you wish.When they ask you questions, try to answer authentically if and when you can.Learn to listen better. Listening isn't just waiting until another person is finished talking., When you can, temper your perspectives and if possible, your appearance, just to keep the peace.  Try to avoid sensitive or provocative topics; instead, suggest useful alternatives.  If they say something to you, good or bad, just say thank you and move on.Don't argue with them all the time. Arguing with another person is what creates conflict.  Not every strange, awful, rude or ignorant thing they say needs to be corrected.If they say something mean or odd about someone you care about or love, you will probably want to stand up to them, so prepare some answers and comments ahead of time.  Needing a break from a person is not a flaw, and you can duck out of the conversation if you need to by excusing yourself and then returning when you have had a chance to collect yourself.If you need another break, take it! Repeat as necessary. Maybe you're trying out having a conversation where before you would have avoided it, or ignored it.  Knowing what will trigger your impatience, anger, or sense of annoyance in advance is the first-step to taking control of your well-being.If you can, ask the person to not discuss that topic/issue, or let them know you haven't forgotten their question and will answer when you can.  If they press you, say nothing and change the topic.  If none of the techniques above work, just let go of the conversation and walk away.  Not replying is still a reply, one saying 'This is too unpleasant a topic to deal with.'  Walking away shows you respect yourself and that you can 'live and let live.' Move on!

"As long as your bra provides you with the correct amount of support and leaves you feeling comfortable, virtually any bra can work under an ordinary, slightly loose t-shirt. Many women find a standard, no-fuss bra the most comfortable but you can opt for whatever style you like best.  Seamless bras prevent lines from showing through your top, making them an excellent choice for tight t-shirts and fitted blouses. Stick with a full-coverage bra to create the smoothest fit, since demi-cup bras hit the middle of your breast and may create a dividing line that can show through your top.  Plunging bras have a very deep center bridge, well below your breasts. If you wear a standard bra with a deep neckline, the cups or bridge may be exposed.  The straps on a halter bra come in closer around your neck, rather than sitting further out along your shoulder. As a result, the straps remain hidden beneath the fabric of your top.  Wear racerback bras for racerback tops. Like the halter bra, the racerback bra has straps that mimic the shape of the top that shares its name.  Strapless bras smooth out your form and provide basic support. They might run a little tighter than a standard bra, however, since the band must provide full support in the absence of straps.  A bra with super thin straps may coordinate well enough with a spaghetti strap top. The straps may not disappear completely beneath your top but as long as your bra straps do not exceed the thickness of your top's straps, you may be able to get away with showing your bra straps in casual settings.  Choose a color that matches your top or stick with a neutral color.  Convertible bras have adjustable straps, allowing you to change the way the straps fit based on the cut of your shirt. Basic convertible bras can usually be changed into halter bras and strapless bras; more extravagant convertibles have even more options.  Silicone adhesive bras have no back and no straps. They stick onto your skin and smooth out your silhouette. These bras offer minimal support, however, so you should only use them as a last resort.  There are no rules about matching the bra to your underwear––nobody sees the 'match' and it's totally up to you whether this matters or not. If it does matter, aim to buy the bra and underwear at the same time to ensure a good match.  ","stick with a standard bra for casual crew neck t-shirts. opt for a seamless bra for shirts made of clingy fabric. look for a plunging bra for deep v-neck tops. try on a halter bra for a halter top. use a strapless bra beneath a strapless or spaghetti string top. try a spaghetti strap bra with spaghetti strap tops. buy a convertible bra for versatility. consider silicone adhesive bras for deep necklines, backless tops and strapless tops. wear any bra with your underwear.

"If the person appears to be increasingly upset, depressed, irritable, or anxious over a few weeks, consider reaching out to your work, school, or community about ways to help them.  If in school, talk with a teacher, school counselor, or advisor about the changes in their behavior.  If at work, talk with a supervisor or colleague about if they can offer additional support.  If at home, talk with other relatives or friends for advice.  Insecure people may feel like they have a limited support system, or don't trust those around them. They may have difficulty with coping, and instead use unhealthy ways to cope.

"Get your shower warm enough so that it is capable of fogging up the glass in your bathroom. Keep it warm enough so that the steam builds, but no so hot that you can’t actually shower in the water.  If you have a means of monitoring temperature in your shower, keep the water at around 105 F (40.5 C), the average temperature for a shower., As it does so, close the door to keep any steam from escaping. Put your leather item on a hanger and leave hanging in the bathroom near to the source of steam, but far away enough from the shower that no water gets on the leather.Try using a towel rack or a door knob as a place to hang your leather item.  Leather is not intended to deal with large quantities of water. Keep your leather far enough from the shower that no water drops get on it. If you notice water condensing on the leather, gently blot it off with a clean, dry towel.  Allow the garment to sit in the steam for as long as possible. Let it remain in the bathroom during the length of your shower, then allow it to hang in the bathroom a bit longer. Wait until the steam starts to dissipate and the bathroom starts to cool before removing the garment.  Do not let the bathroom cool completely. This will set the leather and stop you from smoothing out any remaining creases.  When you're done steaming, lay out the garment on a flat surface and smooth it out with your hands. Pull stubborn wrinkles gently to relax them.  Allow the leather to cool on the flat surface before moving or wearing it. This helps set the smoothed leather and prevents re-wrinkling.

"When babies take their first steps, they are never sure if they shall reach the next side, but they believe in themselves and hope to reach it and slowly and gently they do. When they arrive at their destination, they smile innocently and you can feel they joy of success in their beautiful eyes and smile achievement. Relationships are similar; take the baby steps, feel the calm, and take the chance.  New relationships are the most fun in the beginning stages and it's during this pivotal time when it's easy to take unnecessary leaps. Try your best to keep a logical head and take those baby steps. It'll help you from getting too overly emotional and watch out for future you.  It's easy to find a new love and want to devote all your time to them. Unfortunately, sometimes this results in relationship burn out. You become clingy or desperate and don't even remember how to function without the other person. To avoid this, make sure you maintain your friendships. They were there before, they're there during, and they'll be there after if you need someone to help you pick up the pieces. Don't let them go!  What's more, they'll keep you balanced and rational. Not only with good advice, but by simply spending time with different people. Your thoughts won't be fixated only on this other person and you'll still be that complex, interesting person you've always been with strong relationships to prove it.  If you're the type that falls in love too quickly, it can be helpful to don your 'rational' hat once in a while (if not more often).This is when you take a look at your life (or life in general) and aim to think logically. Here's a few thoughts that can keep the crazy lovelorn-ness at bay:  This person is great, sure, but realistically they're no greater than other fish in the sea. Humans, overall, are pretty similar creatures.  Love comes and goes. Your previous relationships have faded, and this one might, too, at some point. Might as well make the most of it while it lasts.  Emotions are fickle little things. You only think you feel them; if you change your mind, you won't. So while you may feel overwhelmed with emotion, that's just your mind playing temporary tricks on you. Just little hormones going off in your head; it's no more real than that.  Instead of stalking this person outside their house at night, sending them flowers to work, leaving notes on their car, or asking them to hang out 24/7, let's take a moment to focus on staying cool, calm, and collected. You'll be more attractive if you just chill, and you'll probably feel better about yourself, too. When the emotions attack, recognize that they're attacking. Then you can make a logical decision on how to react.  If you feel yourself losing your cool, take a step back. Breathe, and come up with a plan to distract yourself. Pick up a video game, call up a friend, or go shopping. Recognize that you're getting a little too emotional and that it's not in your best interest right now. If you need, call up a friend, say you're feeling a little anxious/love torn/crazy, and let them distract you. After all, that's what friends are for.  Sometimes people get so wrapped up in their complexes that they try to make reality fit their definition of what life or love should be like. They say 'I love you' too quickly, get married too quickly, or even end things too quickly. Take some time to know yourself and what behaviors you're compelled to do and why. Do you actually love this person, or do you just want someone to say 'I love you' to?  When it all feels right, when it all feels compelled by a force you can't withstand, that's letting it grow naturally. Forcing it into a box is getting wrapped up in an idea or feeling and letting that determine your behavior. Instead, go with the flow. When the timing's right, it's right.

"When a person stops paying their FHA-guaranteed mortgage, the FHA may start the foreclosure process, which means that since the buyer can no longer make payments, the FHA will sell the home to pay off the mortgage of the defaulting buyer.Individuals can sometimes purchase FHA foreclosures, for little to no-money down., The FHA as part of HUD provides a website where homeowners can search for HUD properties for sale. You can search for these properties here: http://hudhomestore.com/HudHome/Index.aspx.  Non-government websites also allow you to search for FHA foreclosures. You can locate these websites by conducting an internet search for “FHA foreclosure properties.”  If possible, you will want to determine the reason for the foreclosure. The fact that the home was foreclosed upon may mean there is something structurally wrong with the house that you will need to get fixed as soon as possible. It may also mean the home was owned by someone who got locked into a high-interest loan they could not afford and ended up defaulting. It will be your burden to determine this.  Depending on the reason for foreclosure, these homes may be what you might call “fixer-uppers” or simply be move-in ready homes that someone could no longer afford. Before purchasing a foreclosed home, you should understand the terminology of foreclosure so that you better understand what type of property you may be purchasing.  Insured (IN) homes are homes that have been foreclosed upon, but meet the Minimum Property Standards (MPS). This means that they have been evaluated by a home inspector, who has “passed” the home.  Insured with Escrow (IE) homes require some measure of repair to meet the MPS. This means that the home may have some pressing structural, heating, or plumbing deficiencies that will need taken care of in the short term. The problems are not such that the house is uninhabitable, but significant enough to affect the value of the home.  Uninsured (UI) homes do not meet MPS. This means that the home requires structural, heating, or plumbing repair before it can be inhabited.  People who undertake the project of a foreclosed home are may be DIY-types who enjoy the challenging of fixing up a property acquired on the cheap. If you are not excited about the idea of gutting a house and installing a new septic system (or paying to have this done), this might not be the option for you.  Before purchasing the home, you need to fully understand the condition of the home and the amount of work and money you will need to invest so that the home is livable. You should hire a home inspector who can evaluate the home, determine any significant structural problems and establish how much it will cost to repair.  While homes that need substantial work are technically not available for “no money down” mortgages, if the home meets a certain threshold for repairs, you may be able to qualify for an FHA rehabilitation loan.  If you have discovered significant structural problems, decide how you're going to fix the home up and how much it will cost.  If you plan to do the work yourself, determine how much the materials cost and how much you can reasonably expect for your labor.  If you plan to hire someone to perform the work, determine how much will it cost and how long it will take.  This FHA program allows home buyers to finance up to $35,000 into their mortgage to repair, improve, or upgrade their home.  Contact an FHA-approved lender and discuss the application process. You can locate lenders at: http://www.hud.gov/ll/code/llslcrit.cfm  You should keep in mind that purchasing a foreclosed property that needs a lot of work may not be the best option, particularly if the sum for the repairs exceeds the purchase price of the home, essentially resulting in a “zero money down” payment after the fact.

"Some evidence suggest that MS may cause changes in your immune system that impact your mood.You can combat these changes by making sure you’re doing things to promote your overall health. For example, eat foods that support a healthy immune system and the body’s production of chemicals like dopamine and serotonin that fight depression.Eat plenty of fresh vegetables and fruit. For example, you might add blueberries to your morning oatmeal or have a spinach salad with your dinner.  Drink water, flavored water, or decaf tea rather than drinks that are high in sugar, caffeine, or from concentrate.  Avoid refined grains and processed foods. For instance, instead of a bologna sandwich on white bread, try a shredded turkey breast wrap using whole grain pita bread.  Include proteins, like chicken, nuts, and fish in your daily diet. You might have a handful of almonds as a snack, for example.  MS can cause physical challenges and fatigue that make being active challenge. In addition, major depression can also leave you feeling like you don’t want to and can’t do anything. But regular physical activity can improve your health and decrease your stress. If you’re already seeing a physical or occupational therapist for help with your MS, ask them about ways you can get physical activity at home to help treat your depression.Try low-impact, calm activities like yoga or tai chi that will be easy on your body, but still give you physical and mental benefits.  Practice some of your therapy exercise at home on your own. Ask your physical or occupational therapist which moves would be good for you to practice at home.  Take a daily walk or try things like parking a space or two farther away from store entrances so you have to walk a few more steps.  Find a workout buddy. Exercising with another person helps keep you accountable and makes exercise more fun.  This is a great way to treat major depression and MS because it helps calm and relax your mind and body.You don’t have to try to meditate for hours like a swami, but a few minutes of meditation may help you release stress and tension.  Try sitting or lying quietly somewhere comfortable where you won’t be disturbed.  Focus your mind on your breathing or on a word or phrase like, “Peace,” “Inhale, exhale,” or “I am relaxed.”  Gently redirect yourself when other thoughts enter your mind. Allow them to pass through your mind and then return your focus to your breathing or phrase.  Depression and MS can both cause changes to your sleep habits. The physical challenges of MS along with the fatigue associated with both disorders may have you sleeping more than you would like or need to. At the same time, you may find that you have trouble sleeping because of the symptoms of your disorder. Create a sleep routine and stick to it so you can make sure you're getting the right amount of sleep.Set a regular time waking up and going to bed each day. Even if you don’t feel like getting out of bed try to do so. And even if you don't feel tired, when it's time to go to bed, go lie down.  Create bedtime and waking routines. For example, you might take a shower, have some decaf coffee, and read a book each night to get ready for bed. Avoid things that might wind you up, such as reading a thriller or journaling if it makes you very emotional (journaling before bed may be very helpful for others, however).  Turn your electronic devices, lights, music, etc. off when you’re getting ready for bed. Put your alarm on the other side of the room so that you have to get up each morning.  Although some people think using alcohol or other substances helps their depression, it usually makes things worse.This can be even more so when you have MS because of the interactions the substances or alcohol may have with your medication and the negative impact this can have on your body. You can better treat your depression when you have MS if you limit your alcohol use and avoid abusing any substances.  No one should use illegal substances and if you are under the age of 21, you should not use alcohol at all.  Substance abuse includes using your antidepressants or other prescriptions in a way other than how they were prescribed.  Talk to your healthcare professional if you are abusing drugs or alcohol. They can help you seek treatment.  Evidence suggests that quitting smoking can help improve your overall health (which will make your MS easier to manage) as well as help treat depression.Ask your health care professional about ways to help you stop smoking.  For example, you might say, “What are some strategies or treatments we can try to help me stop smoking?”  Ask family and friends to help you stop smoking. Your loved ones can provide you with encouragement when you’re trying to quit and keep you so busy that you don’t have time to smoke.  Get information about smoking cessation support groups and online forums from a source like MedlinePlus at https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/007440.htm.  ","eat healthy meals and nutritious snacks. get regular physical activity. try meditation. get enough sleep. avoid alcohol and substance abuse. stop smoking. "
"Depending on what your high school offers, taking as many science courses as possible is a great way to start on a career path to becoming a neonatal nurse. You will want to take basic science courses, such as chemistry, physics, and biology, as well as any elective science courses that may be offered (for example, courses in forensics or anatomy would be helpful). In addition, you will want to enroll in mathematics courses, particularly in subjects such as algebra and calculus. Having a strong background in math and science will make you a more attractive candidate for college-level nursing programs.  In addition to math and science courses, you should include English and language arts, psychology, and foreign language classes in your coursework if possible. All of these classes offer skills that you will require as a neonatal nurse.  Take Advanced Placement (AP) courses if offered. These courses can help set you apart as a particularly high-achieving student and can propel you on the right trajectory to becoming a neonatal nurse when you begin college.;  , Admission into college-level nursing programs is very competitive, and your grade point average (GPA) will be important.If you are struggling in any of your courses, talk with your teacher or an adviser to prevent getting a poor grade that may affect your chances of getting into a competitive nursing program.  In addition to having a high GPA, you should look to perform well on your college entrance exams (such as the SAT or ACT).A good score on these entrance exams can help you obtain a place in a great nursing program.  Volunteering in a healthcare setting shows that you have exposure to the demands of working in a healthcare profession and shows that you are caring and dedicated to helping ill people feel better.  In order to find volunteer opportunities, check with your local hospital to see if they offer a summer volunteer program for high school student. In order to find a program near you, do an online search for “volunteer opportunities in hospital” and you will find many opportunities. Alternatively, visit your local hospital and inquire about any opportunities they may have.  While you are volunteering, talk to nurses and to neonatal nurses in particular. They may be able to offer advice or insight into their careers that is hard to match. If you develop a relationship with a nurse, you might ask her if you can “shadow” her for a day. By following her around and seeing her day to day duties and responsibilities, you will have a better idea of what it takes to be a nurse.  Your school may offer these classes as part of their curriculum, or you may have to seek them out from a local community center.Taking one of these classes will demonstrate that you have experience with health-related skills and will show your motivation to become a nurse.  To find a first aid or CPR class, visit the website of the American Heart Association. They list options for courses for the general community that you may be interested in., If possible, you may want to look into attending nursing camp during one of your summers in high school. You can do an online search to see if there is a program that you can attend that’s near you. For example, Seattle Children’s Hospital offers a summer nursing camp to expose high school students to the role of a nurse in various clinical settings.Some nursing camps require you to apply. You will want to find out the entry requirements for a camp you may be interested in attending as early as possible.  You will want to enroll in a college or university where you can get a four-year undergraduate Bachelor of Science degree. Preferably, you will go to a university where you can receive a bachelor of science in nursing (BSN, BScN) degree.Within a BSN program, you will complete your general education courses and also have training in math and science requirements that will be integral to your future career as a neonatal nurse. These courses include statistics, microbiology, anatomy, and physiology.Do an online search for colleges and universities that you may be interested in that have BSN programs. If you are having trouble locating programs, speak with a guidance counselor or other teacher who can help you find a program that would be appropriate for you.  Often times, states have universities and colleges that offer nursing programs. In-state tuition costs are less expensive than out of state programs, and public university is less costly then private.  It is also essential you confirm that the program is accredited through a national organization.  You will need to complete all the courses in your BSN program and keep your grade point average as high as possible. In order to get into a graduate nursing program (which you will need for your training in a neonatal specialty), many programs will require at least a 3.3 GPA (on a 4.0 scale) as well as a grade of B or better in all science and nursing courses.If possible, take neonatal nursing electives. Your college advisor may be able to recommend some relevant electives, or you can talk to certified neonatal nurses to find out what kind of classes they would recommend that you take.  In addition to having good grades, you will need relevant work experience. Many potential employers will want you to have experience in particular working with ill infants.This work experience will be critical for building up your resume. Try to get as much experience as possible working in a hospital setting, whether through internships set up by your college or university or by volunteering or shadowing neonatal nurses at a local hospital.  This is a great way to connect with other students who aspire to become neonatal nurses as well as nurses in later stages of their career that may be able to offer guidance and advice.  To join NANN, visit http://www.nann.org/membership/content/join-or-renew.html. You are able to join online, by email, by mailing a membership application, or by calling NANN Member Services.When applying, you will be asked some basic demographic questions, including your academic credentials, your position, your work setting, and your employment status.  If you are a member of the National Student Nurses’ Association (NSNA), you can join NANN at a discounted rate of $45., This exam is a comprehensive test that must be passed before you can earn your license. Passing this exam will enable you to practice in your state (and some states have licensing agreements with other states) by giving you a state license.Visit the NCLEX website (https://www.ncsbn.org/nclex.htm) to find out what you have to do to apply and register for the NCLEX. You will need to be declared eligible to test by the board of nursing/regulatory body. You can find all the necessary details on the NCLEX website.  After you become a registered nurse by passing your NCLEX exam, you will want to find a nursing job in a hospital that has a NICU. This will give you the opportunity to get experience with ill newborns and enable you to start developing the skills that you need for a successful career in neonatal nursing.  Many NICUs will hire graduate nurses who have an interest in neonatal intensive care.Look for a hospital that will give you the opportunity to work in a NICU as you begin your nursing career.  Look for hospitals that offer mentorship programs.  Many neonatal nurses start out working as staff nurses who care for ill newborns in hospitals.An average day can consist of assisting new moms with breastfeeding, delivering preterm infants, and caring for ill full-term infants.As you become more experienced in your neonatal nursing career you can grow your career by becoming a neonatal nurse practitioner (NNP).  Look to practice nursing in a NICU (preferably a Level III NICU, which is geared to take care of the most seriously ill and/or preterm infants) as a staff nurse before applying to graduate school.This will give you essential experience that you need for your graduate school application.  To become a NNP (an advanced practice nurse who works with other staff to provide critical care to infants in the NICU), you will also need a Master of Science in Nursing (MSN) degree or a Doctor of Nursing Practice Degree in Neonatal Nursing.These programs will prepare you to work with critically ill newborns and working in delivery rooms.Many nursing schools will offer a MSN degree through a two-year Advanced Practice Neonatal Nursing (APNN program).Enrolling in this type of program will get you ready to become licensed as a nurse practitioner or as a clinical nurse specialist., There are three different levels in the neonatal nursing specialty. The levels vary in their demands and in the level of intensive responsibilities.You should carefully reflect on what type of setting you want to work in and consider if your desire is to work with critically ill infants. Regardless of your level of nursing, you will make a difference in the lives of the infants that you care for.  Level I nurses care for healthy infants. While still intense and demanding, this is the least demanding level of neonatal nursing.  Level II nurses care for sick and premature babies that are in need of constant attention. They frequently work in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU).  Level III nurses work in the NICU and monitor the most seriously ill and premature infants. In addition to caring for these infants (usually around the clock), they also are responsible for teaching parents how to properly care for their sick babies.

"Scrunch up your forehead, eyes, and mouth to find where wrinkles naturally form on the skin. Use a brown eyeliner or eyeshadow to lightly trace the lines of those wrinkle spots, then smudge the lines with your finger or a brush. Add bags under the eyes and any other aging spots you want.You can even add highlighter or eyeshadow in a lighter shade than your skin to the areas on either side of your “wrinkles” to make them look more three-dimensional.  Try another method for wrinkles using non-toxic white glue, which you apply in a thin layer to your face. Apply it while your skin is stretched out by puffing up your cheeks or stretching it with your fingers, then when your skin relaxes to its normal state the glue will create wrinkles.Do the makeup or glue treatment to your hands or any other exposed skin as well. You can add blue or green makeup to hands and forearms to simulate prominent or varicose veins.  Finish with touches like bright lipstick or drawn-on eyebrows.  Put on a white or gray wig, or use temporary dye or baby powder to color your own hair for the look.  Tie hair back in a simple, low bun. Or try putting hair curlers in and leaving them there.  If you use baby powder to make your hair gray, try spraying over it with hairspray to help it stick and stay put., Look for large, clear-rimmed glasses with thick lenses in an outdated style. Find a chain or beaded glasses holder to wear them around your neck when they aren’t on your face.  If the glasses have prescription lenses that you can’t see out of, just pop out the lenses before wearing them.  Carry around a cane or walker with you to use for support when getting around.  This prop can help remind you to act like an old woman too, by staying stooped or bent over and relying on the cane or walker for balance.  Choose large, colorful, and over-the-top jewelry for a classic granny look. Put on big pearls, flashy earrings, or several metal or charm bracelets. Stick to gold metal for everything.Alternatively, try a few subtler sentimental pieces, like a tarnished wedding ring or a locket with pictures that would represent children or grandchildren.  A sparkly brooch or pin is also a good addition, to either fasten a scarf or simply pin to the front of a sweater or dress.  For a special touch, fake a hearing aid by fashioning a piece of wax to look like the ear piece. Or use other earplugs or headphones in a light color to look like a hearing device.  The bonus of putting something in your ears to look like a hearing aid is that you truly won’t hear well when others are talking to you, making for an authentic demeanor.  Carry a large, unstructured bag or tote and fill it with some of the following convincing items:  Prescription or vitamin bottles  An extra sweater  Fruit and other snacks  Denture case and cleaner  Lipstick or other makeup  Crossword puzzles or other word games  ","create wrinkles with makeup. achieve gray or white hair. don large glasses. use a cane or walker. wear costume jewelry. make a fake hearing aid. keep other convincing items in your purse.

"When you are shopping for clothes make sure that you are conscious of how the colors and cuts are going to look on you. A shirt might be cute on the hanger but if it has a thick fabric it may make your waist look wider than it is.  Buy the right sizes. You may find a pair of jeans that are only $20, but if they don't fit right, you'll never wear them. Don't waste money on buying something just because its cheap. Only buy clothes that are not too long, loose, short, small or big for you. That means always try on clothes before you buy it.  Get clothes tailored at the dry cleaners. Fit is so crucial for dressing well. A jacket or a pair of jeans can be the best investment, but if the item is too wide or drags on the floor, it won't be. Going to a tailor to get those things to fit just right will make you look more fashionable than having the newest 'it' fashion item.;  , Black and neutrals don't draw attention while bright colors and pales do. If you feel like your legs are thicker than you want, don't buy bright red jeans, no matter how fabulous they are. If you love how tiny your arms look, invest in a bright blue, long sleeve top. Remember: The best color in the whole world is the one that looks good on you  Look to magazines like Vogue, Elle, InStyle, etc. These will debut what is the color scheme of that season. Try incorporating that color in a little to stay fashion forward. Don't buy a yellow dress, for example, because you can only wear that so much. Instead try to buy yellow ballet flats or a yellow belt that you can wear way more often.  50% of your closet should be solid colored, staple pieces. A pair of good jeans will go a long way, a watch can last forever, and a black dress is an instant classic. Investing on these items will pay of in the long run. While a red dress is fun and festive, you are unlikely to wear it a lot. So instead of looking at the price tag at face value think of it like this: cost/times worn. A dress that you wear 2 times might only cost $50, but a pair of $150 jeans that you wear once a week for three years will actually cost you less in the long run.  Staples include things like a little black dress, good fitting jeans, nude heels, a beige coat, black blazer, solid white tees, ballet flats, brown boots, a tailored pencil skirt, etc.  These are things like red jeans, use them to add some spark to your wardrobe. If you find that the color and the fit of the jeans work for you, buy them. Having trendy pieces will make a bold fashion statement and let you have fun with fashion. But then again, trends are just that. TRENDS. Something might be in style, but if it doesn't work for your body type, its best to not waste the money.  Try buying cheaper trendy pieces like cool necklaces, a funky shirt, etc. that you won't feel bad for having spent money on when it goes out of fashion.  Keeping color and fit in mind, star with the basics and build. Once you have that, begin to build with accessories. As Coco Chanel once said 'Get yourself fully dressed and then, before walking out the front door, pause by the mirror and remove one item.' Remember simplicity is best. A cute belt, cocktail ring, or pearl necklace may be all you need to pull your look together.  Put on the basics. If you are going for a bold bottom like coral jeans, chances are that you are going to want to play down the rest of your outfit with something like a flattering white tee.  Add dimension to your outfit. Throw on a blazer or a cardigan. Stick to neutrals to balance the bold bottoms, so something like a navy blazer or beige cardigan.  Find the right accessories. For a bolder look, add chunky gold jewelry. For a preppier look, add a cute headband and some pearl earrings.  Put on your shoes. Add heels for some height, boots for a more casual look, ballet flats for a feminine look.  The first thing someone notices about you is your face and hair. If you take care of these things, and put effort into getting ready in the morning, the most casual outfit will look completely chic. Once again, you want to work on the what-flatters-you-best theory. So skip the neon pink eye shadows you saw in Vogue this month and switch to a light purple that brings the color out of your green eyes.  It's the most important thing a woman can have. Keep a smile on your face; and always keep your chin up and look straight forward when you are walking.  ","shop for the right clothes to make you look good. buy fun colors. buy 'staple' items. buy fun, trendy pieces. put together an outfit. do your hair and make-up everyday. remember confidence. "

"A well fitting girth on a new saddle will be slightly longer than when the saddle is broken in as the billets stretch. You need to use a girth that fastens with the girth buckles just below the appropriate position during the break in period (one or two holes below the middle billet hole on both near and far side).;  , New leathers are rough on saddle flaps that are not yet broken in to accommodate them.  Wait for a day of steady rain. Not a downpour, and light mist won't do the trick. It's best to buy your saddle in the summer when the temperatures are such that you will be able to completely break in the saddle with one ride.  Do not wear a raincoat that covers any portion of the saddle.  During this ride, pay very close attention to your equitation, in particular your leg position and seat. It is helpful to have a friend who watches you and corrects ANY deviation. Start with your stirrups adjusted into the position you most commonly ride in. Shorten or lengthen your stirrups into the other lengths you use once your saddle is thoroughly saturated. Ride equal time in all positions after the saddle is softened by the rain.  The billets stretch most during the first ride.  Seal the exposed leather with a coat of glycerin. Dip a bar of glycerin into water and use a dry cloth to pick up a patch of it. There should be NO bubbles! Coat the top of the saddle fairly thickly and turn over. BE SURE THAT YOU ARE USING PURE GLYCERIN. Many soaps contain basic (high pH) additives that will damage the leather; leather is naturally slightly acidic due to the tanning process.  Use warm neatsfoot oil on the lower flaps (those in contact with the horse), taking care not to oil the side in contact with the horse. Do not oil any stitching. Oil in extremely thin coats, using a soft cloth or sponge. Repeat until the oil does not soak into the leather, then wipe off any excess and allow to set for at least 24 hours. Oil will soak into the leather over time, and may accept more oil after setting. DO NOT OVER OIL THE LEATHER. If it is over-oiled, it will become too soft and delicate, which will decrease the life of the leather. It is not recommended to oil soft leather at any point, including, in some cases, the knee rolls, blocks, and often the seat of the saddle. It is possible, if desired, to lightly oil the smooth side of hard leather on the skirt and upper flaps. Oiling the smooth side takes far longer, but it makes it easier to control the evenness and amount of oil used.  Alternatively, it is possible to lightly oil the billets, following the same instructions as those for the saddle flaps and skirt.  The leather should be darker, softer and shinier than when new.  Continue to closely monitor your leg placement during the first few weeks of service. Check your girth very frequently and use a shorter one when billets stretch and the buckles get too high on them.  ","make sure your girth fits. it is best to break in a saddle with an older set of well maintained stirrup leathers. do not ride in your saddle the day you bring it home. tack up your horse being very careful to have your girth adjusted and the buckle of your stirrup leathers pulled up to the stirrup bar. ride as usual for at least an hour. check your girth frequently!, when you have completed the ride. lightly treat the underside of the saddle as above. you can work the billets with a glycerin wash. knead the glycerin in until they become more pliable. buff the top leather with a soft flannel cloth. allow the saddle to sit for 2 to 3 days before putting into use.

"This will keep them in top shape and prevent fast deterioration. Place them in an open plastic bag - not a sealed one. Plums stored in the refrigerator will last two to four weeks.Make sure your refrigerator is clean and free of heavy smells. Plums tend to take on the smell of the refrigerator after a few days.

"Stir the yeast and the milk together in a bowl. Let it sit for about five minutes, until the yeast begins to foam and bubble.;  , Use a wooden spoon or a whisk to mix well.  1 cup at a time, mix in the flour, incorporating each cup thoroughly before moving on to the next.  Using your hands or a dough hook attachment on your mixer, knead the dough for at least 5 minutes, until it's smooth and elastic., Use plastic wrap to wrap the kneaded dough and let it chill in the refrigerator for 1/2 hour.  Place it in a mixing bowl and whip it until it's light and fluffy. If the air in your house is warm, add 1/2 cup flour and whip it with the butter to help keep the butter stiff.  Place it on a floured surface and roll it out using a rolling pin. The dough should be rolled so that it's about 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) thick.  Dip a knife into the butter and spread it to cover the entire surface of the dough rectangle. Keep spreading until you've used up all the butter  , Do it lengthwise, like you'd fold a letter.  It needs to chill for another 1/2 hour.  Remove it from the refrigerator and roll it into a rectangle again. This time, with the dough rectangle facing you horizontally, fold the two ends over so that they overlap each other. This type of fold is called a turn. Wrap up the turned dough and refrigerate it for 1/2 hour., Remove it from the refrigerator, roll it into a rectangle, and fold it into thirds, like a letter. Return it to the refrigerator for 1/2 hour.  Remove it from the refrigerator, roll it into a rectangle, and turn it so that the two ends of the rectangle overlap.  After all that folding and turning, the dough needs time to rest. Wrap it in plastic and place it in the refrigerator. It'll be ready for frying in the morning.  One final time, roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface. Leave it a little thicker this time - about 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm).  You can add holes by using a 1” hole cutter in the middle of each circle.  Allow it to reach a temperature of 350 °F (177 °C).  Use a slotted spoon or spatula to transfer the cronut from the pan to the oil.  Cronuts will expand in size as they fry. When they're finished, transfer them to a wire rack or paper towel to cool.

"For the sake of discussion, consider the myriad issues and problems plaguing the Middle East. While complete understanding of these problems is impossible, there is a lot more to the area than ISIS and oil wars. To start better understanding it, you have to dive into the broader events and issues that have been affecting the Middle East for thousands of years, not just the events of the last six months.  What sorts of things do you think about when you think about the Middle East (or any region)? Do you have any actual evidence or proof of these beliefs, or could they be explored further?  Being understanding requires forgetting about your baseless ideas and stereotypes and diving deeper. Very few things in the world are black and white, and believing they are will get in the way of an open, inquisitive mind., More often than not, where a person lives has a far greater impact on what they do than any sort of conscience choice. The violence in the Middle East is caused by a myriad of sources, by one very large one is the incredible and lasting drought in the region -- the worst drought in 900 years.When people can't get basic amenities like water, they are much more prone using violence to protect themselves. Think about where people live to gain a deeper, more nuanced understanding of how they live.  Look no further than the United States for proof. While there is an overarching 'American' culture, even light travel reveals that people have different attitudes and customs from state to state. Geography matters., Continuing with the Middle East, the current cycle of violence makes much more sense when you realize that, after World War I, European nations re-drew country boundaries to force warring tribes to live together.These long-standing conflicts were ignored by the British and French colonists, who wanted in-fighting to prevent rebelling against the Europeans. Unfortunately, this inter-country strife is rearing it's head again today in bloody civil wars, but these wars make much more sense when you know the underlying historical issues.  Understanding goes hand and hand with knowledge. The more you know about a region or group of people, the easier it will be to understand them., Understanding is less of a goal and more of a process. You can never 'completely' understand a culture, but you can remain open-minded to new ideas and practices as they come to you. By trying to keep an open mind, letting go of old ideas in favor of learning everything you can, you remove the biggest roadblock to understanding others.  It is easy to say that 'Islam is a violent religion' because of recent violence in the Middle East. But such a claim blinds you to the millions of peaceful, driven, and kind Muslims in the world, as well as Islam's own peaceful aspects.  If you're traveling, bring around a collection of photographs from home, as this is an easy and immediate way to start conversations. Don't be afraid to share foods, experiences, and ideas. Understanding is a two-way street -- if you make an effort to share something from your life, most people will make an effort to share parts of theirs.  You don't have to travel to start this -- host an exchange student or family, go see a traveling cultural event from another country, or volunteer with a refugee program.  The sorts of books, music, and movies people enjoy can say a lot about what they value. What are the sorts of quests their heroes embark on, for example? Currently, the US is in the grips of 'superhero mania,' which may suggest a desire that anyone can be extraordinary, as well as the growing powers and responsibility of god-like technologies. Even if your insight isn't quite as clear-cut, just sharing in the arts of another culture is a wonderful way to begin understanding it.  Think about how often you ask new friends, 'what music/movies/tv shows do you like?' Humans bond and socialize over art, learning about each other indirectly.  ","recognize that cultures are far more diverse and complicated than the sum of their parts. consider the all-important impact of geography on a region's culture. dive into the greater history of the region to uncover long-standing influences. leave your existing biases and ideas at the door. share parts of your own culture to encourage others to share theirs. read, watch, and listen to other cultures' media.

"Epsom salts are approved by the FDA for use as a short-term laxative. If you have some Epsom salts at home, then you can mix 1 to 2 teaspoons of Epsom salts (check the package to be sure about how much you should use) into eight ounces of water and drink the solution.

Your doctor may recommend an over-the-counter laxative, suggest visiting the office for an exam, and make other recommendations to help you have a bowel movement. Your doctor will generally only recommend such medications if over-the-counter laxatives have been ineffective., Warm liquids are a great way to get things moving in your digestive system and they can also help to keep you hydrated. If you are just starting to feel constipated, then start by drinking a cup of warm herbal tea, such as peppermint or chamomile, or a cup of warm water with about a teaspoon of lemon juice added to it.  Sip the warm fluids slowly and wait to see if this helps you have a bowel movement. You may feel the urge to go while you are drinking the warm fluid, or it may take a while.  Prunes are well known for their ability to produce bowel movements. If you have some prunes or prune juice around your house, then try eating or drinking some prunes to help you have a bowel movement.You don’t need to overdo it, just have a few prunes or one cup of prune juice.  Light exercise a great way to stimulate your digestive system as well. If you have been sedentary for a while, try getting up and taking a walk around your neighborhood to get your bowels moving.Even if constipation is making you feel uncomfortable, don’t sit or lie down. Get out and move around every day.Going for a daily walk or run can help ease constipation., A mixture of baking soda and water may also help to relieve your constipation. Mix a teaspoon of baking soda with ¼ cup of water and drink the solution. This remedy can also help to relieve gas or an upset stomach along with your constipation.Keep in mind that baking soda is high in sodium so this remedy is not ideal for people following a low-sodium diet.  Stool softeners are for oral use, and are a relatively gentle laxative. Stool softeners are good products to use at first if you have occasional constipation. A stool softener, such as Docusate, works by increasing the amount of water the stool absorbs. The stool then becomes softer and easier to pass.Follow the instructions on the package. Generally you will take a stool softener once a night before you go to bed.  This is a good option if you are just starting to feel constipated because it is gentle. Stool softeners can also take a little while to work, such as one to three days.Do not take it for more than a week unless advised to do so by your doctor.

Because your appointment for dialysis will be on the same days and times each week, many patients make friends with the other individuals there for dialysis.  Dialysis has the potential to cause some serious cardiovascular effects. These effects include low blood pressure, high blood pressure, and pericarditis. Your doctor will monitor you for these conditions, but it is good to be aware of the risks as well.Low blood pressure. Low blood pressure or hypotension, may be a side effect of dialysis, especially for those who have diabetes. This can be accompanied by abdominal cramping, vomiting and shortness of breath. Report feeling these symptoms to your dialysis nurse immediately so changes can be made to the settings on your dialysis procedure.  Increased blood pressure. Taking too much salt or fluid between treatments can increase your blood pressure and your risk of heart disease, heart attack and stroke. Based on your individual medical needs your physician may recommend sodium and fluid intake limits.  Pericarditis. If the hemodialysis is not effective it can lead to pericarditis or an inflammation of the membrane that surrounds the heart. This reduces the efficiency of the heart muscle and can lead to stroke or heart attack.  Even though dialysis is not a painful treatment, it may be uncomfortable at first. Symptoms such as muscle cramps and itchiness are common complaints during and after hemodialysis.Muscle cramps. Although the exact reason why is not known, adjustments to your sodium intake between and during the treatment can help to reduce muscle cramps.  Itchy skin. It is common to experience itchy skin during and after hemodialysis.  Talk with your physician if you have trouble sleeping immediately after hemodialysis. You may be experiencing sleep apnea or restless legs from the process. People who use peritoneal dialysis do not appear to have this side effect., Anemia is a common side effect of both kidney failure and dialysis. The hormone erythropoietin is responsible for the production of red blood cells but is made in the kidney. Your doctor will most likely want you to have regular blood tests to check your iron levels.Talk with your physician if you experience fatigue, shortness of breath, or believe that you may have anemia.  Changes in mood are common for people going through dialysis, but there are treatments to help with this side effect.

Support groups and counseling with a therapist or pastor can help when the mood changes are related to the experience you are going through and not just from biochemical changes in your blood.  After approximately five years on dialysis, your risk of developing amyloidosis increases. When proteins in the blood are deposited in the joints and tendons it causes pain, stiffness and fluid retention in the joint areas.If you believe you are experiencing these symptoms, discuss your options with your physician.

It is difficult to bend down after dressing fully in a kimono, so you should get the socks out of the way while you can.  It consists of a white cotton top and skirt, which you can easily substitute with separate pieces if you can't find an actual juban. Today in Japan, an alternative is to wear only the white collar that goes around the neck called a 'cri-sugata.'  , For both men and women, you should wrap the right side of the kimono over your body to begin with, then bring the right side of the kimono towards the left side of your body, overlapping it with the left side as you do so. Adjust the white slip collar to show evenly around the neck, just under the kimono collar.  The length of the kimono is always adjusted, which is why there are only a few lengths made by the manufacturer.  Cross the belt in the back and tie it in the front. Straighten out the excess material and bring some down to cover the koshi himo belt.  Tie this belt in the front, leaving the overlapping kimono fabric visible below. The excess kimono fabric should hang out evenly below the belt so that the fabric is seen.  Tie both ends of the obi together, folding it in across your waist and tightening it at the center.

"Soaking in warm water can relieve hemorrhoid pain. Run a full bath or sitz bath (a small basin that fits over your toilet, allowing you to soak your anal area). Keep the water warm and add 1 cup of epsom salts to a full bathtub or 2 to 3 tablespoons of salts to the sitz bath. You can soak two to three times a day.If you have hemorrhoids, you need to keep the area clean. Be gentle when showering, bathing, or using the toilet. You don't need to use soap, since it may irritate the area.You can apply Cetaphil lotion to calm the area without causing more irritation.Pat yourself dry with a clean towel.;  , To numb the pain, apply a cold ice pack or cold compress. Take a clean cotton washcloth and soak it in cold water. Apply the compress to your hemorrhoid for about 10 to 15 minutes. You can do this frequently throughout the day.If you're using an ice pack, place a cloth between the ice pack and your exposed skin.Applying ice directly to the skin can damage your tissue.  After soaking and drying the hemorrhoid, apply a small amount of aloe vera gel, or anti-itch lotion.Look for something containing petroleum jelly, mineral oil, shark liver oil and phenylephrine. The phenylephrine acts as a decongestant and helps shrink the hemorrhoid. You can also use Aloe Vera gel to soothe hemorrhoids.If the hemorrhoids are very painful or uncomfortable, apply a bit of baby teething gel to the area. Teething gels contain a local antiseptic that can reduce pain and discomfort.  Avoid using steroid creams because they can damage the delicate tissue around a hemorrhoid.  Take a cotton pad and soak it in witch hazel. Place it on the hemorrhoid after you have a bowel movement. Repeat this as often as you need to, at least four or five times a day. Alternatively, place it on a pad in your underwear for longer lasting relief.Witch hazel can relieve itching, discomfort, irritation, and burning caused by hemorrhoids. It may also reduce swelling., Slowly add fiber to your diet, increasing in small increments since it may cause gas or bloating. While everyone needs a different amount of fiber based on calories consumed, try to get 25 grams (0.88 oz) of fiber a day if you're a female or 30 grams (1.1 oz) of fiber a day if you're a male. Fiber will soften your stools, making them easier to pass.Different fibers have different effects on your body, so aim to include more wheat bran fibers and other cereals, which are the fibers that affect stool softness.Fiber supplements can reduce hemorrhoid bleeding, irritation, and inflammation.If you feel bloated or gassy, you may be eating too much fiber.  You can increase your fiber by choosing whole grains, fruits with the peel or rind, leafy greens, beans, and legumes.You may also be able to get fiber in yogurt that contains active cultures and probiotics., Choose more nutritious, smaller meals and eat throughout the day. This will give your digestive system a chance to process the food and give your body the nutrition it needs to heal the hemorrhoid. Drink plenty of water throughout the day.  Fluid keeps your stools softer making them easier to pass., Choose low-impact exercises like swimming, dancing, yoga, and walking, but avoid activities that can cause straining, such as weight-lifting. Low-impact activities have an anti-inflammatory effect on your body, which can help relieve hemorrhoid symptoms.It also keeps your body systems healthy and your bowels moving.  Try pelvic floor exercises.Exercise also reduces pressure on your veins which may be contributing to hemorrhoid pain., It may be helpful to purchase a foam cushion or a doughnut cushion to sit on. This can help relieve some of the pressure. Avoid sitting directly on hard surfaces.  Direct pressure on the hemorrhoid can increase swelling and even cause new hemorrhoids., If it's possible, try to use the bathroom without interruptions at the same time every day. If you pass bowel movements regularly, it will reduce your need to strain.Regular bowel movements are a great indicator of overall good health.  Don't strain or push too hard. Let gravity help, but allow your bowels to do most of the work. If nothing happens, wait an hour or so and try again.  It may also help to place your feet on a small stool so that your knees are higher than your hips., Passing stools regularly is important when you have hemorrhoids. Avoid straining since this commonly causes hemorrhoids. Instead, choose a bulk laxative or stool softener to temporarily use. Bulk laxatives can soften your stools and reduce the pressure needed to pass the stool which will help the hemorrhoid start to shrink. While your stools should be regular because of the fiber in your diet, you can choose one of the following laxatives:Bulk laxatives: These contain fiber (usually psyllium) to increase the mass or weight of the stool, helping it move through the bowels.  Stool softeners: These soften the stools by adding moisture which should make them easier to pass. Most stool softeners contain docusate, which is what adds the moisture to soften the stool.  Lubricant laxatives: These lubricate the walls of the intestines and rectum, making the stool pass easier. Most lubricant laxatives contain mineral oil. They are usually safe when taken for short periods of time, but are not recommended for long-term use.  Avoid stimulant laxatives that include senna, cascara, aloe, or bisacodyl. They work by irritating the interior of the bowel, which is not helpful when you have hemorrhoids.  The most common symptom of external hemorrhoids is bleeding and discomfort during a bowel movement. You may first notice external hemorrhoids when you clean yourself after using the restroom. A hemorrhoid will be a tender swelling around your anus often about the size and shape of a grape when it first appears. It can also be itchy and painful. Commonly, people notice blood on the toilet paper or in the toilet bowl.If you're unsure if you have internal or external hemorrhoids, consider what you can feel. You won’t usually feel internal hemorrhoids, but they can bulge through the anal opening. Typically internal hemorrhoids have few symptoms other than bleeding with bowel movements.  Most external hemorrhoids go away or at least shrink within two to three days. If you still have hemorrhoids after three to five days, call your physician. You should also contact your doctor if the area is painful or bleeds. Your doctor can diagnose internal or external hemorrhoids by doing a rectal exam.If rectal bleeding is not caused by a hemorrhoid, your doctor will probably recommend a more extensive test called a sigmoidoscopy or a colonoscopy because one of the symptoms of colon cancer is rectal bleeding., If your hemorrhoids don't respond to basic home care or resolve on their own, your doctor may recommend a minimally invasive surgery. The most common approaches include:Ligation: A rubber band is tied around the base of the hemorrhoid to cut off blood flow.  Injection (sclerotherapy): A chemical solution designed to shrink the hemorrhoid is injected.  Cauterization: The hemorrhoid is burned away.  Hemorrhoidectomy: The hemorrhoid is surgically removed in this outpatient procedure (although it sometimes requires an overnight hospital stay).

Write down or think through a list of all the reasons that make you want to marry her. This will be important for expressing your love to her at the proposal, as well as confirming to yourself that you're making the right decision. When you see your girlfriend, you should feel that you absolutely want to share the rest of your life with her, and that the time is right for you to tell her that.  Though they say, 'When you know, you know,' this can be a little confusing. The important thing is that you propose because you genuinely want to, not because she's dropped so many hints about getting married that you don't want to disappoint her, not because you feel like you've been together long enough and that it's just about time for you to do something, not because everyone around you is getting engaged, and definitely not because your friends, pastor, and family members keep putting the pressure on for you to propose.  Many people believe that you should move in with your girlfriend for at least a few months before you know she's the one. You may like her at a distance, but once you have to share a bed, groceries, and some mutual expenses, you may see an entirely different side of each other that isn't as compatible as you believed. Of course, you don't have to do this, but it's one way of 'double checking' that you can really see yourself spending the rest of your life with her.  It can help to talk this through with a close friend or family member, as long as you're sure that person won't spill your secret. Avoid discussing your plans too widely with others, as it can soon filter back to her through the grapevine.  ;  , Though it's impossible to be able to predict with 100% accuracy that she'll say yes to you, you should have a pretty strong sense that your girlfriend loves you and wants to spend the rest of her life with you. See if she's dropped hints that she wants to get married (to you), that she wants to move in to a house with you, to have kids, to make you a part of her family, and so on. If she's never mentioned these things, then you can try out some feeler conversations to get a sense of her feelings; if she acts uncomfortable or deflects your questions, then she may not be ready to get married.  If you've only been together for a few months, make sure you know that she's in it for the long haul. Though many happily married couples got engaged after being together for only a few months, spending more time with your girlfriend to make sure that you're both the right people for each other can help you make sure she'll say yes.  Though you may be nervous about figuring out her feelings if you're not sure, this can save you from embarrassing yourself during a proposal, when you should have figured out she wasn't ready.  Although asking a father's permission is considered by many to be old-fashioned, it hasn't died out precisely because it's a gesture that suggests that you respect her and her family and that you're always going to be considerate of her family. It's also a sign of politeness, and what family can resist that? But again, it really depends on the girl and her family situation, so try to feel it out.  Put her first – is this something that would be important to her and her family? Or is it something that might make her cringe? Or maybe she is estranged from her family. Take your cues from your knowledge of her existing situation and preferences. You should know her well enough by now.  Another modern twist on asking for permission is to do so after you've proposed. This can be a way of ensuring that your wife-to-be is the first to be asked but she's aware that you still intend to bring her family right into the fold by asking; this can also be a good excuse to turn up together to share the news. Some people consider that this is the 'wrong way around' but it's still a sign of respect, and frankly, it's your choice.  If it isn't possible to ask her father, ask her mother.  It's important to get the timing right, and timing is really only something that you can work out. It's not possible to say that there are perfect times to propose, but it is important that you propose at a time when you're not rushed and when you feel calm, sorted, and ready. Once you've planned the proposal in as much detail as possible, then the time will be right. Here are some things to keep in mind:  Is there a meaningful day to the both of you? Such as an anniversary of your relationship or first date, or some other commemoration?  Sometimes the time chooses itself by sheer practicality, especially if the two of you are living in different cities and come together for a special holiday event and this is your only chance to ask her.  Consider the time of year she wants to get married. It's helpful to ask her or indirectly through her friends or family if there is a certain season, month, or length of time she wants to be engaged in order to plan the wedding without feeling overwhelmed or rushed. If she's mentioned that she wants a fall wedding, try proposing around that time the year before -- if you propose just a few months before the fall and she wants a bigger fall wedding, she may not like the idea of waiting well over a year to get married.  Proposing on special holidays or birthdays has advantages and drawbacks. On the one hand, these days can make the occasion more meaningful, especially if family is gathered around or it's a time of great joy. On the other hand, you will always share your proposal date with the holiday date; if you want to celebrate your engagement date, this can make it feel less impersonal for some, while for others, it's a great way to remember!  Whenever you do it, make sure you have some alone time right after the proposal. If you plan on proposing to her on Thanksgiving with your families nearby, for example, make sure you take her out on a long walk or somewhere private when you do it, before you get overwhelmed by family and don't have a minute to yourselves to process what just happened.  The place and atmosphere of the proposal will be remembered forever and the most important thing to remember is that you are the principal creator of the atmosphere! Naturally, you can propose absolutely anywhere, but it helps to choose a place that will be meaningful for both of you and where you can feel comfortable, calm, and natural.  Where are her favorite places? Does she love the beach, sunsets, tall buildings, bridges, cityscapes, nature, etc.? Or maybe she'd prefer a private screening at the local cinema?  What is practical? The harder you try to create a special occasion, the more things can go wrong. Sometimes it's just easier to focus on what you know will work and will be appreciated by both of you.  Consider romantic places such as the beach, a botanical garden, a famous restaurant with an amazing view, a covered bridge, a picnic, etc.  Consider the safety of the location. A man once proposed to his girlfriend on a cliff; she said yes, but became so excited that she slipped and fell to her death. This is why you should always take safety into account when proposing to your lover.  Consider the things the two of you love doing together. Perhaps this can serve as a source of inspiration, such as proposing when you're out camping, fishing, sailing, hiking, cycling, attending a sports event, traveling somewhere, etc. The benefit of proposing during something you love doing together is that she won't suspect that you'll be proposing, since it'll be part of your usual routine.  Make reservations if you need to. If you're proposing somewhere like a restaurant where you need to be able to get the best table, etc., be sure to reserve it well in advance.  Once you've decided the when and the where, the intimate details of the how need consideration. Naturally, there is the ring to produce, but what other elements do you want to add into the mix to make this an especially memorable and romantic occasion for her? Bear in mind that the manner in which you propose will be retold by her many times over, so make sure it's good! There are many possibilities and it's entirely up to you what you do but for some inspiration, here are some suggestions:  Try the traditional pose. Bend down on one knee, take her hand in yours and ask her to marry you. The beauty of this gesture is that it's universally recognized thanks to the movies, and it can be performed anywhere. Just note that if there are other people around, they'll be eavesdropping (kindly!), so expect their interest and support.  Get a sense of whether she'd like something public or a bit more private. Though many women are proposed to in public in the movies, in real life, most engagements are private. You may think it's a great idea to propose to hear at half-time during a sporting event or at an intimate party with several of your friends around, but she may be mortified by all of the attention. Plus, if it doesn't go well, you'll feel even worse in front of a bunch of people.  Think about things that might accompany the occasion, such as a quartet playing a tune or a serenade, or a tiny fireworks display, etc. These sorts of extras are not necessary and they will bloat the budget unless you've got willing friends to help out, but if it's your kind of thing, they can add to the atmosphere.  Hide the ring. This is another popular method for proposing that requires her to find the ring, and then you do the proposing. Places to hide a ring include inside flowers, chocolates, or a special gift. Be sure to ask her to open the gift at the time, or you might be waiting ages! And take great care not to hide it somewhere that she can accidentally swallow it; that'll put a big dent in the occasion.  Be creative. If you're not so traditional or you're not that keen to say the proposal yourself, there can be a number of other ideas for proposing that involve some more planning but can be really entertaining as well as confirming for her that you're the kooky guy she wants to spend the rest of her life with. You could prepare her very own word puzzle or crossword in which the final answer spells 'Will you marry me?'.  You can do something small and cute involving children in your families, or even a pet that you own together.  If you have the means and think she'll like it, you could have a plane write the question across the sky as the two of you are walking along.  Proposing on a vacation is another popular move. If you do this, just make sure that she'll say yes! Nothing will make your vacation worse than a rejection on the first night.  Perhaps use publicity, such as taking out an advertisement in the paper that you know she'll read, or getting her favorite radio DJ to announce the proposal, or place a big banner with the question on it over a bridge she drives under every day.  If you know what kind of ring your girlfriend wants, then great. But if you don't know or don't want to ask, get a temporary ring, and then get another after you propose; for many women, choosing their own ring is the preferred option. But if you know exactly what kind of ring she wants, then you should try to sneak out a ring she usually wears to get it sized and to find out her ring size. She'll be touched that you remembered exactly what she wanted -- and that you got it in the correct size! But if you have no idea what kind of ring she wants, asking her about it 'casually' will pretty much let her know what's on your mind.  You don't have to blow a fortune on an engagement ring, especially if you really can't afford it. It's better to get something small and classy and to save for your future together instead of spending all your savings on a piece of jewelry.  If budget is a concern, consider all types of natural diamonds. The diamond industry now offers many types that fit within everyone's price range including clarity enhanced, laser drilled, and natural GIA certified HPHT diamonds.  Read How to choose an engagement ring for more information.  Dress well to be sure that you're as handsome and attractive as can be. This is a very special occasion and it deserves to be 'picture perfect'. She'll appreciate the effort you've gone to. Naturally, this only applies where you're planning to propose somewhere elegant and you have time to change beforehand. If you're proposing on the beach, during a hike, skiing, or as you're skydiving, use your common sense about what to wear!  , If you're going to propose, it pays to practice. Practice asking, and practice explaining the reasons as to why you love her so much that you want to spend the rest of your life with her. This will help you avoid being tongue-tied when the important moment comes up. This doesn't mean you should put a lot of pressure on yourself. Though it helps to make your girlfriend feel extra special, in the end, she may only remember the words, 'Will you marry me?'  Keep the proposal simple, to the point, and from the heart. For example: 'Mel, I love you more than words can ever express. You're the most thoughtful, generous, kind, and beautiful woman I've ever had the fortune to know and I'd be honored to have the chance to spend my life with you. Will you marry me?'  , There is no time like the present to move on with your carefully thought through plan. Bring her along to 'the place' and start unfolding your plans. Be sure that you don't give things away by touching the ring in your pocket constantly, or saying daft things. If you're bringing her to a place she's never been before, or somewhere extra romantic, and you have a feeling that if you're there for more than thirty seconds, she'll know exactly what you're up to, then try to propose as soon as you can, so you don't lose any of the surprise factor.  There may be tears, screaming, or shock. Don't be fazed; these are fairly standard reactions, even if she has every clue of what you're about to do. It's not real to her until it's done!  If she says yes, end the proposal with a kiss or a hug. And don't forget to put a ring on her finger!  If she says no, react with understanding and don't be petulant. She may need time to think and a memory of your sour face and grumpy attitude will leave a bad impression in her mind. Be a gentleman and don't be down on yourself -- you tried your best.  ","make sure she's the one. be as sure as you can be that she'll say yes. if her parents are old-fashioned and your significant other wouldn't find it offensive or sexist, you could consider asking her parents for permission. decide when to propose. decide where you will propose. decide how you will propose. look for a ring. be dressed in your best according to the occasion and choice of place. practice. propose.

"You high school counselor is a general resource, who can help not only with selecting classes and getting into college, but also with saving for college. Speak to the counselor at your school for information about savings plans that may be available and about scholarships for which you or your child may qualify. Guidance offices often sponsor workshops and lectures about college savings., Banks are not only in the business of earning money but also helping you save money. To get some help saving for college, visit an adviser at your local bank. You will be able to get information about investment programs that the bank offers for its customers, as well as information about federal and state-sponsored programs. As a local resource, the bank is also likely to be more familiar with scholarship programs in your area or contacts with local colleges and universities., Many investment programs for college savings will require the assistance of a professional financial adviser or stock broker. Many people think that financial advisers are only for wealthy investors, but that is not true. Even people with modest incomes who wish to make the most of their savings should be consulting with a professional adviser. Here are some suggestions for finding a reliable and helpful financial adviser:Ask friends, relatives or colleagues for recommendations. If people you know have used a particular individual or company, and have been satisfied, then you may as well. This is a good way to get started.  Consider whether you want to hire someone who is fee-based or commission-based. A fee-based adviser will collect a retainer or hourly fee, but then may be more likely to work with a wider range of products. A commission-based adviser does not collect a fee from you but earns a commission on the investments that you make.  Visit reliable websites. The Garrett Planning Network offers a nationwide search tool that helps you locate financial advisers across the U.S., particularly who service middle class customers. MyFinancialAdvice.com is another tool that offers financial advice for modest investors.

"Callas will do best in a cool room that isn’t too light and is away from direct sunlight or other sources of heat, like radiators.  Avoid putting them near a TV or computer, as these areas can get warm with extended use.  Keep them out of drafts.  Keep them away from fruit bowls, as ripening fruit emits gases that will encourage the flower to mature, shortening its lifespan in the vase.  Aim to replace the water every day or two and keep it topped up. A steady supply of water is essential to the health of your lilies, and should never be neglected.  Mini callas will probably need additional water more often as they should be sitting in less water than regular ones.  Some people like to keep their vase in the fridge overnight to preserve the life of their flowers – but be warned you need a big fridge for this!  It’s a bad idea to expose calla lilies to a gas called ethylene, which is produced by some foods, so only store your lilies in an empty fridge.  It’s probably best not to put them in a domestic fridge.  The water in your vase will need a complete changing every day or two. This is to prevent any bacteria in the water from building up and attacking your lilies.  It also stops the water from smelling.  Callas will absorb a lot of water, so keep it topped up.  Every second or third day, trim another half inch off the bottom of the stems. This is because the cells at the end of the stem will die.  Refreshing the cut helps exposes fresh cells and helps them absorb water.  Replace the water in your vase when you do this.  Remember to replace the flower feed or whatever additive you were putting into the water.  ","put your calla lilies' vase in a good location to keep them healthy. keep the water at a good level to keep your flowers hydrated. be careful when deciding whether or not to store your flowers in the refrigerator. drain and change the water completely to make sure it doesn't get dirty. recut the bottom of your lilies to refresh them.

"Before you even get started on purchasing the aquarium and its supplies, you need to be certain of the type of fish and fish community that you'd like to keep. Some fish will require more work to maintain than others, so this might be one of your first considerations. There are various types of fish tank styles and communities that you can choose from, including a goldfish tank, a cichlid tank, a saltwater tank, aggressive fish, a mixed community, etc. The best choice for a beginner is a goldfish tank or a freshwater tropical community tank as these are the simplest to maintain. Or, you might like to consider a betta (Siamese fighting fish) bowl or tank but, as largely a 'fish' tank rather than a 'fishes' tank, it's rather limiting.  'Community' fish are fish that get along with many other kinds of fish and do not require unusual water conditions. They do not need to be with fish of other species. Most don't need to be with other fish of their own, though some such as tetras, are happiest in schools. But it seems nice to keep at least two fish together so they can't get too bored and it also provides more interest for you.  Goldfish are tough, but they do best in cool water. Don't use a heater, and keep them away from a window. They have a fast metabolism and don't digest their food very efficiently, so they produce a lot of waste. A moderately-stocked tank with a good filter is much better than a bowl - and a requirement for a healthy,long life for the fish. The unusual-looking 'fancy' varieties do not compete well with the normal-shaped common varieties, so choose one category or the other.  Bettas naturally live in swamps in which they can't see very far (and the males, the colorful ones normally sold, defend modest territories by attacking much of what they can see); they can't move very much (and so don't move, eat or excrete much), and often don't have enough oxygen (and so are fortunate to have a special 'labyrinth organ' to process gulped air).They do best with clean water and swimming space, so a 2 1/2 gallon (9.46 liter) to 5 gallon tank with a filter is a good way to learn the basics of caring for fish. You can't keep more than one male in a tank (at least not without little in-tank compartments). Female bettas can be kept in groups of 4-6, but make sure one is not very aggressive. They tend to abuse other fish, due to aggression, or be abused, due to ornamental bettas' long, ineffective fins, but can get along with some community fish such as small catfish.;  , The greatest cost is when you buy the start-up gear, but there are the ongoing costs of fish food, replacement fish, dechlorinator, etc. Be prepared to spend US$50-$100 for a small tank and equipment (5-10 gallons (19 to 37 liters), freshwater). Saltwater tanks start at hundreds of dollars. However, you might be able to pick up a bargain during sales if you know what you're looking for.  If buying or receiving a used tank, check it thoroughly for cracks, hairlines, and any faulty parts. Fill it all the way up in a bathtub or outside to check for leaks. You are best off buying all the electrical equipment brand new even if you get the tank secondhand.  If you chose a saltwater tank, you will need at least a 30 gallon (114 liters) aquarium, while the optimal would be a 50 gallon (190 liter) or more tank.The minimum size to try for a freshwater community aquarium would be 20 gallons (75.7 liters). If you decide on a betta, you will need at least a 5 gallon tank (19 liters). Small fancy goldfish should have no less than 20 gallons (75.7 liters) per fish. Large goldfish like comets will need at least a 100 gallon (378.5 liter) tank when full grown. Remember, bigger is always always better when it comes to aquariums.  Bear in mind that the surface area is more important than the shape of the aquarium because the surface area is where the gas exchange occurs., Say you chose a 10 gallon (37 liter) freshwater community aquarium. As a rule of thumb, provide at least one gallon (3.7 liters) of space per inch (2.5cm) of fish. So, in a 10 gallon (37 liter) tank, you could have ten one-inch fishes. For instance, three two-inch (5cm) platies and 4 one-inch neon tetras.  The amount of fish flesh, and its metabolism and waste production, increases very roughly with volume, the cube of length. So the inch-per-gallon rule is best with typical little two to four-inch fish. You could add two or three one-inch neon tetras per gallon, but a ten-inch (25.4cm) cichlid might need twenty gallons (75.7 liters) of water to himself and a powerful filter.  Make sure your fish can swim several times their body length before turning around. Two five-inch (14cm) fish would be uncomfortable in a little ten gallon tank, but ten of them could swim around merrily in a fifty gallon tank.  Sea or marine sourced fishes must be stocked at rate considerably lower than that of their freshwater cousins., Then do research on those fish and see if they will be compatible in your tank. Not all fish can be kept in the same tank, even if they are all freshwater community fish (there are different degrees of 'community' tolerance), all saltwater fish, or all cichlids (cichlid home environments differ, and each aggressive species' type of aggression differs and should be researched carefully). A tiger barb and a guppy will probably not live together peacefully: tiger barbs will nip long fins.  Plants can improve water quality and ambiance for fish if healthy, but require more maintenance and equipment such as upgraded lights like those for saltwater reefs (which can create an overheating problem) and some require carbon dioxide injection (good filtration tends to aerate out all the fish themselves produce).If you decide to plant your tank, be careful to choose only plants that will not get too big for your tank. Keep in mind plants are not appropriate for goldfish tanks.  If you want to have plants, choose algae eaters that won't eat the plants. Siamese algae eaters ('True algae') are effective and compatible with many other fish.  Plastic plants create much of the human-pleasing appearance and most if not all of the fish-pleasing hiding spaces of real plants. You can take them out and wash them to remove excess algae. Soap and other cleaners are very bad for fish, so don't use any or rinse very thoroughly. However, some fish will be much happier with live plants.  Saltwater tanks more commonly have corals, most of which photosynthesize, and macroalgae than true plants. Saltwater fish aren't easy to care for, and corals are harder.  Fish need cover. Will you provide it with caves or plants? Fake plants? Real plants? A pirate ship? It is a good idea to sketch your aquarium and lay out where decorations and plants will go. Try to include varied hiding spots and give consideration to the introduction of plants that would best mimic the plants the fish you're getting are used to.  Be aware that the decorations and plants suitable for a freshwater tank and for a saltwater tank are extremely different. For starters, you can't grow plants in a saltwater tank because freshwater plants won't grow in saltwater and the plants that will grow in saltwater (macroalgae) provide tasty treats for the fish and disappear in no time!And decorations suitable for a freshwater tank may not be suited to a saltwater tank; for saltwater, prefer plastic plants, ceramic or plastic ornaments. Do not use driftwood as it will leach tannin into a saltwater tank and acidify the water.What sort of gravel, sand, or other substrate will you have for the base of the tank? Even rocks, coral, and substrate must be chosen with care to avoid harming the saltwater balance, so always take these matters into account when selecting the design elements.  There are several considerations here, including safety, temperature, and accessibility.  Ensure that the tank sits on a level, solid, and structurally sound surface. Put the tank in a place that isn't likely to get bumped but if it does, it will not topple over. If you live in an earthquake prone region, ask about how you can bolt the tank to the wall or another surface to ensure that it doesn't end up on the ground.  Also, check how much weight the floor can take; water can cause a lot of damage. A big tank needs not only to be kept from falling on the floor but supported evenly. With gravel and accessories, a tank weighs about ten pounds (4.5kg) per gallon (3.75 liters). For example, a 55 gallon tank (209 liters) weighs around 600 pounds (274kg) when full of water and the ground needs to be able to cope with the weight.A stand with solid sides rather than just legs is a good idea to help distribute the weight over the entire stand and not just down the four legs.Five gallons (19 liters) can be OK on a sturdy table; ten gallons (37 liters) should, and twenty (75.7 liters) or more essentially must have a purpose-built stand.  Ensure that the tank is not located near direct sunlight, drafts, doorways, and windows. You need to guard against temperature extremes and these are the locations likely to cause such variations. Be careful not to locate a tank under a heating or cooling vent either.Keep in mind where you will make water changes when locating the tank; close proximity of a water supply and basin is important.  As well as ensuring that the tank is located in a safe and solid position, consider the importance of grounding the tank. Water conducts electricity, and saltwater conducts it very well. Install a ground-fault circuit interrupter outlet (GFCI/GFI) or plug all the equipment into a portable one, which looks like an extension cord with a bulky plug with buttons. Make a 'drip loop' with each cord: it should dangle down and come up again before connecting to any socket so water running down it won't get in. Do not plug the aquarium into any outlet that isn't protected by a GFI or into a circuit that isn't protected by a GFI circuit breaker., While you're probably anxious to get your fish to move in, patience is key in this hobby. If you are not going to take the time to set up your tank properly, don't bother. If you put many fish in an 'uncycled' tank–one not allowed to develop beneficial bacteria by feeding those depositing themselves from the environment or a bacterial supplement with the waste of a fish or two for a few weeks–you will cause numerous problems with diseases, rising ammonia and nitrate levels, and end up with lots of dead fish. Cycling the tank is about building up the nitrogen content and there is varied advice on how to go about doing this, depending on the tank type. If you ask at the pet store, they may be able to recommend a bacterial culture that you can use (follow the package instructions). Fish author Boruchowitz suggests that caution is your best ally in cycling the tank and for a marine tank, to begin with one to two fish fed sparingly over a few weeks, test the water and if it's within acceptable ammonia limits, to introduce one or two more and do the same for a few weeks more.Then, when it has all regulated after about six weeks, add the entire content of the tank. Another possibility is to use a bio-filter, transferring gravel, a bio-filter wheel, or from an established tank into the new tank.However, it is a good idea to read the suggestions specific to your fish species to find the best way to cycle the tank in your situation.  Use this time to learn about tank care and specific requirements. Saltwater tanks, for example, require quite a lot of additional maintenance and equipment, so it's important tor read up on what you should do and to make sure that you have all of the equipment in place, such as a hydrometer, thermometer, how to mix the salt solution, how to vacuum substrate, filtration, lighting, etc. If this list is already wearing you out, it's not a good idea to start with saltwater tanks as a beginner!  , When you have set up your tank, cycled it, and settled on what fish you want, you can head to the local fish store and pick out your new aquatic buddies. After that, you might like to read an article on wikiHow for caring for your fish, such as:  How to take care of goldfish  How to care for guppies  Take care of a betta fish  How to care for corydoras.  ","decide what kind of aquarium you want. be prepared to set aside a reasonable amount of money to set up your aquarium. depending on what kind of aquarium fish content you choose, you need to determine how big the tank will be. after you have decided what kind of tank you want, decide which (and how many) fish you want. go to local pet stores or look online for fish that appeal to you and to ascertain their suitability. decide if you want to plant your tank or not (if it's a freshwater aquarium). plan the static contents of the tank. locate the aquarium in a suitable place. keep safety considerations at the forefront. set aside a month or more for your tank to cycle before you get your fish. find your fish.

"When you're prescribed braces and rubber bands, your orthodontist should go over instructions with you. Rubber bands are applied in different ways depending on the structure of your mouth and what issue your orthodontist is trying to correct. You should ask them first about any questions you have regarding your rubber bands. If you are confused about any instructions after leaving the office, call your orthodontist., Rubber bands are usually attached to the hooks on braces. Learn the different parts of braces before attempting to use rubber bands.  Braces have brackets, triangular structures that are positioned on the front midsection of your teeth. Brackets are attached by archwire, small metal bands between brackets.If you need rubber bands, small hooks or buttons will be strategically placed at various parts of your braces. This is where you'll attach your rubber bands. The number of hooks or buttons you have, and where they are found, depends on the position of your rubber bands., Vertical elastics are one of the most common forms of rubber bands for braces. They're used to occlude crooked teeth together.  With vertical elastics, there will be a total of six hooks. Two hooks will be between your upper canine teeth, which are the pointier teeth found in the corners of your mouth. There will be four hooks in your lower mouth, two between your lower canine teeth on either side of your mouth, and two others on either side near your molars. Molars are the bigger teeth towards the back of your mouth.  You will use two rubber bands. On either side of your mouth, wrap the rubber band around the upper hook and lower hooks to form a triangular shape., Cross elastics are another common configuration of braces. They are used to correct an overbite.  You will only use one rubber band in cross elastics. On the left or right side of your face, there will be a button towards your top molars on the side of your teeth facing your tongue. There will be another button on your bottom molars on the side of your teeth facing away from the tongue.  Connect a rubber band between these two buttons, starting with the top button., Class 2 and 3 elastics are a variation on cross elastics that are used to correct different issues.  Class 2 elastics are also used to correct overbites. Your orthodontist might prescribe them over cross elastics depending on your type of overbite. On your upper canine teeth, there will be a hook on the side of your teeth facing away from your tongue. There will be another hook on your lower teeth attached to your first molar. This will also be on the side of the tooth facing away from the tongue. Attach a rubber band from the first hook to the second hook.An overbite has usually another negative part called over jet, which means that there is a space between your lower and upper teeth when you close your mouth. Class 2 elastics are used to correct also the over jet.  Class 3 elastics are used to correct an underbite. There will be a hook on your lower canine teeth, on the side of the teeth facing the tongue. There will be another hook on your upper teeth on your first molar, on the side facing the tongue. Wrap a rubber band around these two hooks., Front box elastics are used to correct an open bite. That is, when you are unable to fully close your mouth.  There will be four hooks, two on top and two on the bottom, found towards your front teeth on the incisors. The incisors are the sharper teeth found directly next to the front teeth.Connect the rubber band between all four hooks, forming a box shape., Many people dislike having to wear rubber bands on their teeth; however, your dentist prescribed you rubber bands for a reason. Understand why rubber bands are sometimes necessary.  Braces themselves adjust the alignment of teeth to straighten them out. Rubber bands do the work of pulling the jaw forward or backwards in order to line up your teeth correctly so they fit together when you bite down.Rubber bands play an important role in adjusting the muscular reflex of biting in the right position, so wearing them is really important, even if it feels awkward in the beginning.  If you have an extensive overbite or underbite, you will probably be prescribed elastics. You should wear them as your dentist instructs and only take them out to brush your teeth.It is also important to check if you have placed your rubber bands in the correct position, as your orthodontist showed you. Take some pictures in the dental office and compare them at home using a mirror.  Unless your orthodontist or dentist instructs otherwise, your rubber bands should be changed three times a day as they lose their elasticity over time. Changing them before bed and after meals can help you stay on schedule., In the event a rubber band breaks or falls off during sleep and cannot be found, you need to replace the band immediately. Rubber bands should be worn 24 hours a day, seven days a week. For every day you skip wearing rubber bands, you lose three days of treatment. This can result in you having to wear braces significantly longer than is comfortable.  It will take your teeth time to adjust to rubber bands. Expect your teeth to be sore for the first few days.  The first 24 hours with rubber bands is generally the worst. After awhile, you'll be able to wear your rubber bands nonstop with minimal pain.  If the pain is intense, talk to your orthodontist about gradually easing into wearing rubber bands rather than starting off wearing them 24/7., Orthodontist-prescribed rubber bands generally hold up well, but they do sometimes break or fall off. Always keep backup rubber bands. If you're going out, keep a small bag of backup bands in your pocket or purse., Rubber bands come in a variety of colors. As many people feel unattractive when wearing braces, and experimenting with different color rubber bands can be a fun way to make them feel more appealing.  Try coordinating colors for special events like holidays. You could use black and orange rubber bands for Halloween, for example.Ask for rubber bands in your favorite color. Some orthodontist offices may make neon or glitter colored rubber bands for teens and preteens.  ","get instructions from your orthodontist. learn the different parts of braces. put in vertical elastics. figure out how to put in cross elastics. apply class 2 and 3 elastics. use front box elastics. understand the necessity of rubber bands. change your rubber bands three times a day. replace lost or broken rubber bands immediately. prepare yourself for sore teeth. have backup rubber bands. have fun with colors.

"Wheat flour is not allowed on the paleo diet, but you can swap it with a gluten-free and grain-free alternative. Try swapping regular flour for coconut flour, almond flour, or almond meal.Just be aware that you will need to adjust the recipe, as you cannot swap coconut or almond flour 1:1 with wheat flour.  Coconut flour and wheat flour are not equivalent and, if you are using a recipe that calls for wheat flour, you will need to make some adjustments. For example, if the recipe calls for 1 cup of regular flour then you will need to use 1/4 to 1/3 cup of coconut flour. You may also need to add more eggs — for every 1 cup of coconut flour, you will need to add six beaten eggs and 1 cup of liquid, like coconut milk.It is generally a better idea to follow recipes that specifically use coconut or almond flour instead of experimenting and trying to swap them in for wheat flour. Try making some paleo coconut flour brownies.  Rice is not allowed on the paleo diet, so you will need to replace it if you want to make a paleo swap for rice. Grated cauliflower makes a nice substitute because it resembles rice.Grate a head of fresh, raw cauliflower using a box grater. Then, cook it as desired or enjoy it raw.  Swapping vegetables for grains is a popular paleo strategy that you can try even if you are not following the paleo diet.  Pasta is a great comfort food, but it is not allowed on the paleo diet. However, you can easily swap it for vegetable noodles made from zucchini, beets, carrots, or sweet potatoes.  If you have a spiralizer, then use it to turn your vegetable into noodles.  If you don’t have a spiralizer, then you can also use a vegetable peeler to create the noodles. Just wash and peel the vegetable and then use the peeler to continue shaving long strips off of it. Collect these strips in a bowl and cook them as desired.  Breakfast can be a challenge if you are used to eating cereal in the morning. To make a paleo swap for cereal, you can opt for some muesli or granola.  Check the ingredients and look for a granola or muesli that has little to no added sugar in it.  ","use coconut or almond flour instead of regular flour. grate cauliflower to use in place of rice. make some vegetable noodles instead of pasta. have granola or muesli for breakfast instead of cereal.

"For all intents and purposes, a “dipped” car (that is, a car coated in Plasti Dip) can be washed in exactly the same way as a traditionally painted vehicle. For the most thorough cleaning, hand washing the car with automotive soap (or even dish soap), clean water, a hose, and lint-free cloths for washing and drying is probably your best bet.Should you so choose, you can purchase soaps and cloths marketed specifically for dipped cars.Since Plasti Dip provides a protective coating against UV rays, salt, etc., applying waxes or similar finishes/protectants after washing is unnecessary.;  , Because of Plasti Dip's composition, solvent-based cleaners could cause bubbling, peeling, or other damage to the applied product. Basically, just stick to common soap-based cleaners.Exercise caution when adding fuel to your car, as spilled or dripped gasoline could harm your Plasti Dip finish. You can order special drip guards if desired., Because Plasti Dip can be peeled off by hand with relative ease, some people are hesitant to use pressure sprayers to wash their dipped cars. However, if the Plasti Dip has been properly applied, allowed to cure for a few weeks, and is not peeling along edges or other spots, a common water sprayer of up to 1800 psi can be used.This means you can use one of the self-wash bays at your local car wash without incident.  If you want to exercise added caution, use only the level of water pressure needed to get the job done.  The various scrubbers, sprays, buffers, and so on should not pose a problem., While some enthusiasts dip their entire cars, others stick to applying Plasti Dip to their hubcaps and wheels. Typical soap-based cleaning methods will work fine in keeping dipped wheels clean.However, newer spray-on, no-scrub, rinse-off cleaners developed for wheels (whether dipped or not) have come on the market as well.  ","hand wash your car normally. avoid thinners, solvents, and gasoline. use a pressure sprayer up to 1800 psi. go through an automatic car wash. once again, if the plasti dip has been properly applied, has had time to cure, and isn’t peeling, a trip through the average automatic car wash will have no negative impact on it. wash brake dust and grime off your wheels.

"Also known as isopropyl alcohol, this common household cleaner is inexpensive and can usually be found at grocery and discount stores. Rubbing alcohol is very effective at dissolving some types of adhesive. Apply a small amount with a Q-tip or cotton ball, let it sit briefly, and rub gently to remove.  Rubbing alcohol can dry out and irritate skin, especially in delicate areas like the face. Use only a few drops at a time and allow your skin to rest between uses.  The active ingredient in most nail polish removers is acetone, a chemical solvent. Acetone also works as a solvent for many common glues and adhesives, dissolving them on contact.Rub a small amount into the affected area and let it sit for a few moments, then continue rubbing gently to remove.  Acetone can have a similar drying or irritating effect on the skin as rubbing alcohol, so take similar precautions.  If you can find it, pure acetone works just as well as nail polish remover.  Exercise care in using acetone; it is a highly flammable substance and thus should not be used in combination with heat.Avoid using non-acetone nail polish removers as they will not contain the solvent required to dissolve the bandage residue.  Products like Vaseline made out of petroleum jelly work like oils and lotions to remove adhesive from the skin. A unique benefit is that petroleum jelly is extra-thick, so it's easy to let it sit for a long time (though its greasiness makes this unpleasant for some). Simply work a thin layer into the affected skin and let it sit undisturbed for five to ten minutes, then wipe off with a gentle rag or paper towels.  Adhesive removers are generally manufactured either as sprays or disposable wipes. They are a little more expensive and harder to find than the methods above, but they work especially well.  You may be able to find these products at your local pharmacy. If not, a wide variety are available for order online. Prices vary from product to product but typically range between $10–$25 per bottle or package., Many chemical products (especially rubbing alcohol, acetone, and some adhesive removers) can irritate the skin if they are in contact with it for too long. To avoid this, make sure to wash the area with soap and water after each use of these chemicals. This will help remove them from the skin and reduce irritation.  If you aren't able to get all of the adhesive off your skin at once, consider waiting a day before you repeat use of a harsh chemical again. The break will give your skin a chance to rest and recover. Alternatively, combine a chemical treatment with one of the gentler solutions.  ","apply rubbing alcohol. moisten with nail polish remover. coat with petroleum jelly. employ a pharmacy-grade adhesive remover.these products are specially designed to remove the types of adhesives found in bandages. rinse with soap and water after using a chemical solution.

"Rinse your hands for 10 seconds.Before applying the medication, it's always a good idea to perform this step. You don’t want bacteria on your parrot’s eye because it can worsen its vision.;  , It can be difficult to open the bottle when holding your parrot. You want this to be fast as possible, so your bird won’t be irritated.  Your parrot may be moving around when applying the treatment, so having someone around is helpful., The reason why not to cover the parrot and pick it up from the perch is because your parrot will grip the perch with its nails which can harm it. The parrot will resist.  Ensure your parrot’s head is out of the towel.  Your parrot will escape if it knows you are approaching with a towel because it is intrusive, so try to do this silently.  You should be holding the parrot like you are holding a taco.  The towel on the bird should be snug, holding its wings. Don't place your hand on its chest.  You want to make sure the area is clean.  If discharge is present, clean eye with sterile eye wash solution.  Place tissue aside and dispose later because you don't want to deal with reinfection.  However, birds will typically bite on the towel, so for some birds you don't need to hold chin. This ensures that the medication will be applied precisely in the eye.  Don't touch the tip of the bottle or the birds eye to minimize contamination and blinking. Allow ten seconds for the drop to disperse in the parrot’s eye.  If your parrot continues to blink, you can apply a drop in the nostril and some will travel to the eye.  You should follow your vets instructions. If you aren't sure, the frequency is printed on the side of the prescription.  Some eye drops for specific infections or swelling need to be applied every two hours, once a day, or twice a day. In that case, it's imperative to check the label on the prescription.  Your parrot will gain a positive experience and would be easier to apply eye drops when needed.  Ensure the parrot's water bowl is full because it was probably struggling to escape when applying the medication.  Reseal medication to ensure its effectiveness.

"Search the web for resources for digital memory books and scrapbooking. You have a couple general options when it comes to digital memory books:  Websites that allow you to put together your memory book for display online. These sites act as aggregators where you can add and arrange digital content into virtual albums. Some of these websites focus only on pictures and their captions, while others allow you to also share stand-alone text, videos, audio, and URLs. You can either upload your own content or add content already on the web to your digital memory book.  Programs, templates, and websites for building a more traditional memory book which may be published later as physical hard copies. These will allow you to select a size and format for your memory book and arrange pictures and text onto each page just as you would a traditional memory book. They are often paired with an integrated print service that will allow you to order a printed, professionally-bound copy of your book.Even if you decide to keep your book digital, these services can be used to create shareable files.  Scan or download all elements you plan on including in your digital scrapbook. Make sure to optimize your content for your platform of choice.  If you intend on printing out your book, remember to scan and save your images and pages at 300 DPI (dots per inch) at minimum. Save as a TIFF for perfect image quality.  If you intend to keep your book entirely digital or publish on the web, compressing images to lower their file size is likely appropriate. JPEGs are generally good for photos but often introduce artifacts. GIFs are more appropriate for text or simple art but are limited to 256 colors and don't work well with photos.  PNG-formatted images can be of good enough quality for print while not being too big for the web.With modern high speed Internet and large hard drives able to handle larger files, this format is becoming more common.  Some digital memory book programs have their own built-in image editors. However, you will likely need to touch up your pictures with an image editor before importing them. Adjust contrast and brightness and correct colors as necessary. Crop your pictures digitally just as you would with scissors.  Although not entirely necessary, choosing and sticking to a font (or set of fonts) and color scheme for use throughout your book will give it a much more professional look. You can use text with multiple fonts, colors, and sizes in the same project as long as long as each is used for a different purpose. For example, you could use large all caps purple lettering for titles with smaller black text for your captions.  Pick colors that match your theme. For example, a memory book of your college years may use your school's colors.  If you're using a template, allow it or your software to guide you through the process, adding text and pictures where necessary. If you are creating your memory book free-form, it will be up to you to decide how each page should look. Just remember that memory books should include both pictures and text. Use picture captions to tell a story.  If you want professionally bound digital hard copies of your memory book, either use your software's printing service or find one online that's compatible. You can also choose to do an inexpensive version of this at home by printing out your pages and assembling them in a notebook or with binder clips. You may also choose to store your book onto disks or flash drives to share with others. If the file is small enough, you can even simply email the file out. If you're using an online scrapbooking tool, make sure your privacy settings allow it to be viewable and share the link to you page.

"The best way is to start small if you don't have a lot of financial resources.;  ,, You don't necessarily have to have 5 different kinds of sage, just make sure you have the basics. And remember that there are many medicinal herbs that can't be overlooked if you're selling plants. Herbs are nice, especially the annual kind, because people will come back over and over for the same plants. Herbs never get old. You always need them to spice up a dish, so it's not like the newest flower on the market that may fizzle next year.  Plus some plants are better made from cuttings or rooting.  You'll have to do the research on the plants you choose to provide. The customers will want to know how to grow and use the herb at home so be prepared. Some varieties will cross-pollinate with others so make sure you really space them out or only grow one kind of herb at a time. There's plenty of information on the internet about growing times and needs of the various plants.  However, this can be very expensive and not a good way to start small.  You'll need plenty of dirt and containers to put them in if you're selling the plants themselves. For seeds you can buy small envelopes and make labels off of your computer. For the herbs themselves you can sell them fresh or dried. You'll need packaging and you'll also want to make sure that you provide them freshly cut to your customers. This isn't the best way to market your herbs, but it can be done. Some restaurants need regular shipments of fresh parsley for their dishes. If you're going to do this you need to make sure you have a heated greenhouse for the winter months and a couple of years in to know that you can provide the need or you may lose a customer forever.  Plant markers can be bought, but they're expensive. You can buy plant markers and print them on your computer. Or if you're doing it extremely cheap and as a side thing you can use plastic wear handles. I prefer these to Popsicle sticks because after many waterings the wood will give up even the most permanent marker. And if you don't know what the plant is you won't sell much. Something else to do for the customer is to give them a print out about the plant, the care and the uses, since most people don't want to buy something they don't know about. That way you can get the newbies that want to try herbs but are afraid to invest the money.  You can provide fresh or dried flowers to your local florists. While these are not herbs, if you're growing and have the room this is a good way to expand yourself.  You'll sell a few of the lesser-knowns and draw in more customers with the broader selection without taking up too much space on your tables.  There are plenty of ways to get your stuff sold. Just remember word of mouth is good. Initial advertising is absolutely necessary. If you can advertise by word of mouth you'll SAVE a little money. But you'll reach the most people by newspapers, fliers, and signs posted around town.  ","start small. do your own marketing analysis, although this will take several years of business to establish the trend for the area. , make sure to grow a variety of herbs. grow a few yourself, and providing that they're not a hybrid you can save the seed rather than buying it. buy the plants already started. find inexpensive sources for good dirt and containers. mark everything you sell. grow plants for flower shops. give people the idea that they have a large selection to choose from by only carrying a few of the not-so-good selling varieties while stocking up on some of the more well known sellers. sell the plants and seed online, from your front lawn just like a yard sale, to businesses, or at a farmer's market.

"If you feel as though you need a cigarette, tell yourself to wait for 10 or 15 minutes. Often this works better than the immediate thought of denying yourself a cigarette. In the meantime, begin an activity that will occupy your time. Use a timer if necessary and repeat the process.;  , Most indoor facilities do not allow smoking. Take a trip to the mall, a museum, a restaurant or a library.  These could include drinking alcohol or coffee, smoking after a meal, or being in situations where others are smoking, such as at a party or a bar.  Eliminate spicy foods and sugar, which tend to increase cravings for cigarettes. This is due mainly to the fact that your blood sugar levels become slightly altered, which trigger you to supplement with nicotine so you will not eat any more.  Make your meals last longer. Try to stretch out the time it takes to eat, and chew slowly in order to digest your meal properly. This will leave you with a satisfied feeling, and lessen your craving for nicotine.  Eat a piece of fruit for dessert to enhance the feeling of satisfaction.  Snack frequently on foods that are healthy and low in calories, such as carrots or apples. This will allow you to use your hands and put something in your mouth instead of smoking.  Throw away any hidden packs of cigarettes and get rid of all ashtrays.  Replace cigarette smoking with an activity you enjoy, such as jogging, playing tennis or riding your bike. Daily activity will increase your endorphins, which will leave you feeling better and less likely to need a cigarette.  Try yoga or meditation, which both require breathing exercises. If your body becomes relaxed through calm thought and breathing, you can avoid stress, which is a major mental trigger that may cause you to pick up a cigarette.  Nicotine patches, lozenges and gum all help to alleviate the physical symptoms of nicotine, which in turn calm your mental cravings.  Outline the reasons you need to quit smoking, including your health and the health of those around you.  The ingestion of nicotine will only trigger your body to need more, putting you at the risk of smoking more than 1 cigarette.

"This doesn't mean you have to like his friend. It just means that if you get close to his friend you might get a head start when talking to him.;  , If he walks with another one of his friends, then get your guy friend to walk with them just by saying, 'Hey there's ______ !' and when they start talking to you, you can introduce yourself to your crush. Hopefully after that you will be able to start a conversation.

"Most items will usually defrost within up to 24 hours; however, large items such as frozen turkeys and chickens may take several days to defrost.  Place frozen items that weigh approximately 1 lb. (0.45 kg) into the refrigerator the day before you plan to cook them.  Calculate the amount of days needed to defrost large items such as hams or turkeys, allowing 24 hours for every 5 lbs. (2.26 kg). For example, to defrost a turkey that weighs 16 lbs. (7.25 kg), place the turkey in the refrigerator at least 3 days prior to cooking it.;  , Your food will take longer to defrost if the temperature of your refrigerator is several degrees lower.  Any juice that drips from your defrosted food onto other food in your refrigerator may contaminate those foods.  Some foods must be prepared and eaten immediately to prevent bacteria growth; however, you may refreeze the food, as long as it is placed in the freezer within the time frame in which you should have eaten it.  Eat ground meats, seafood, and poultry within 1 and 2 days after they have been defrosted.  Eat lamb, pork, beef, steak, roast, and all other types of meats within 3 and 5 days after they have been defrosted.  ","determine when to defrost your food in the refrigerator. verify that the temperature of your refrigerator is set to 40 degrees fahrenheit (4.44 degrees celsius). place your frozen food on a plate or dish to prevent leaks. prepare your food shortly after it has been defrosted.

"Do you have any relationships in which you feel suffocated, bossed around, confused or distressed, or just plain fed up with being told what to do a lot of the time (and feeling very guilty that you keep giving in)? Is there someone in your life around whom you feel you have to tiptoe and be super careful to mollify or not anger? Do you know someone who seems to have 'buttons' for going off at you at the simplest of things you say or do, often without rhyme or reason? If you feel that any of these situations have a ring of familiarity to them, then you may be dealing with a controlling person.Controlling people can be male, female, or outside of the gender binary. Controlling relationships can be romantic or platonic. Be just as wary of a jealous friend who hates your significant other as you are of your significant other, especially if your friend is unhappy with his/her romances.  Just because someone has a forceful personality doesn't make them a controlling personality. The test is: Do they allow you to be yourself, or do they unduly influence your behavior?  Distinguish people with strong boundary issues from controlling people by testing their reactions to other topics. If someone always blows up if they're touched without warning but doesn't react in a controlling way if you wear your hair differently or lose weight or gain weight, etc., that is a boundary issue. Other people's personal choices such as changing religion, dieting, grooming or exercise are boundary issues. Even if you think you're right and they're wrong, someone who's sensitive on any of these subjects is holding a boundary when it's about what they do with their life and how they're treated. It's when they start telling you who you are, what to wear, think, feel and do that they're being controlling.  Don't feel too bad if you discover that you are sometimes controlling with other people in your life, especially if you grew up with a controlling parent. On a deep level, whatever you grew up with feels 'normal' and it takes work to stop treating others the way you were treated. It's a big part of recovery to break the pattern in yourself. If you notice it at the time, it helps to back up and apologize to the person whose boundaries you crossed. This can save healthier friendships and relationships in your life.;  , Moodiness is a key signal of a controlling person. Moody people tend to be mulling over perceived hurts and injustices that have happened to them and seek to remedy their internal pain and improve their situation by controlling others.What better than having someone else run at your beck and call and having another person accepting blame or being afraid when you don't want to delve deeper into fixing your own source of pain?  Moody people tend to sulk or cast a pall of gloom right in the middle of a moment of happiness.  These people will often throw a hissy fit when inadequate attention is being paid to them and their needs. This is a manipulative way of controlling that can be hard to say no to because the person will often say they are in pain/upset/hurting and the like, trying to make the other person feel bad for them.  Frequent temper outbursts, especially those accompanied by bullying (the coward trying to control others) or threats (easier to shout out dire warnings of potential harm to you than to investigate their own internal source of harm) are a sign of a controlling person.Temper outbursts often happen when you disagree with them (however lightheartedly or kindly) or don't do exactly what they want you to do (which can be difficult to glean sometimes, as many controlling people expect you to be able to 'read their mind'). In their minds, you are challenging their authority over you when you either disagree with them or don't comply with their wishes.  Coupled with moodiness, the moody temper-throwing person can be a real handful because you never know where you stand with this person. Unfortunately, their inability to handle and work through their anger or resentment can be taken out on you as physical, verbal, emotional or sexual abuse. Never put up with a person harming you. It is not your fault that they hurt inside. Sadly, it is more likely that someone else in their youth behaved the same way toward them and they're perpetuating a bad cycle.  Questions can reveal several things in terms of a controlling person when they respond in a frustrated or condescending way:  As already alluded to, a controlling person thinks that you can read their mind. If you ask basic questions about what to do together, where to go, what they want, etc., they can become easily frustrated because they expected you to have all of their needs thoroughly accounted for and placed ahead in priority over yours. Questions mean a decision still needs to be made, when the controlling person thinks the decision has already been made, all about them and for their convenience.  Controlling people often assume that they understand how you think, even when they actually don't. They may become frustrated because their constructed image of you is at odds with what you say.Questions can irritate a controlling person because they would rather be in control of the questioning, not anybody else.  Questions can verify for a controlling type of person that the questioner is in need of guidance and control because they don't know the answer. This may actually become worse over time because the controller is seeking to have the controlled person second guess his or her own decision-making abilities.  Controlling people may try to control you by making you feel like you’re their “everything.”They may flatter you, even when these compliments are shallow or inaccurate. Often, though, controlling people will turn belittling or cruel at the drop of a hat, especially if they think you’ve done something wrong.If you frequently feel small, embarrassed, humiliated, or sad after this person talks to you, you might be involved with a controlling person.  For example: Cassie is Maya's best source of feeling good about herself and she likes bossing Cassie around. So, Maya often tells Cassie that she is a good friend but never agrees to call her her best friend even though Cassie often refers to Maya as her BFF. In this way, Maya holds out the possibility but never confirms it, putting her in control.  A controlling person may put you down or make you feel stupid in order to get you to think that you need them. For example, Jake tells his girlfriend Sujata that she’s overweight and could never get another boyfriend. He says she’s lucky he goes out with her. This is controlling and abusive behavior, and you never need to put up with it.  Controlling people often demean or criticize others as a means of building themselves up and appearing superior and in control. In fact, a controlling person is easy to spot from the constant monologue about how rotten, stupid, evil, ridiculous, annoying, etc. everyone else is (presumably they're never any of these things).  'This person will tend to insist until they wear you down and make you give in, changing your firm no to a weak yes, and leaving you feeling guilt-ridden and ashamed of yourself. Remember that it is your right to make decisions, including ones that are in the negative and that refuse to do what this person asks.  A common type of control that happens in romantic relationships is pressure to have sex.If your partner tries to pressure or guilt you into sex even when you don’t feel like it, they’re attempting to control your behavior to get what they want. You always have the right to say no.  Do you often find yourself altering your own personality, plans or views to fit someone else's, even if you are usually a strong person?If so, you might be dealing with a controlling person. Here are some warning signs:  Does the person ignore, underplay or override your own experience or expressions of your own feelings? Controllers attempt to define your reality. If you say you're tired and the person says you're not, that's a good sign he or she is a controlling person. If you say you’re upset and the other person ignores it, she or he may be controlling.  Do you often find yourself expected to change your plans for this person? Let's say you have your day all planned out, and then you receive a phone call from a friend, and you tell them your plans. The person wants to join in with your plans, with the exception that your time doesn't work well for them, or maybe that isn't the place they want to go. The next thing that you know, your plans have totally changed. You end up seeing a movie that you didn't care to see, at a time that you didn't really care to go.  It is in these areas that you can truly spot the controlling person at full throttle. Unlike a highly opinionated person (who can be a pain in their own right but isn't seeking to control, just air their own opinions loudly), a controlling person lacks the ability to tolerate or accept differences between the two of you. Indeed, a controlling person is always seeking ways to change some part of your core traits or personality, reshaping you as part of their feeble attempt to control the world around them. While it could be said that relationships are not democracies, neither are they dictatorships. It is important to seek a balance you're comfortable with within any relationship and the ability to compromise, tolerate, be flexible and give and take both ways is essential to healthy relationships.  Most people who are controlling always throw in the argument the words, 'you are the problem', or 'you have a problem.' Nothing is ever their fault.  Controlling people often have difficulty dealing with problems objectively and will manipulate the conversation to blame others when their own mistakes are pointed out. When this happens, end the discussion without allowing the controlling person to successfully shift their blame to you and/or credit away from you or others.  If you really love this person, the 'bind' they've got you in can be even more difficult to both see and escape from because your love keeps trying to excuse their behavior.  ","consider how you feel around the people in your life before all else. look for moodiness. suspect any person who has a temper and uses it often. think about how this person reacts to being asked normal questions. listen to how they speak to you. be wary of any person who seems incapable of understanding or accepting the word 'no. consider what happens when you want to be yourself or do your own thing. review how this person sees difficult situations, mutual decision-making or issues of responsibility.

"It isn’t always about some elaborate way of getting her notice you and how you’re different in a great way. Everybody looks a million times kinder and more attractive with a smile.  Don't be creepy about it. There's a fine line between an attractive smile and the unnerving smile of a sociopath.;  , This is not exactly a crazy idea nor is it one that you would immediately think of as guys tend to think about big, heroic acts first. The truth of the matter, however, is that you can impress a girl simply by being able to hold an interesting, intelligent, and, hopefully, exciting conversation.  It’s something that doesn't matter to most girls. What girls really care about is attitude, confidence, and personality. So if you talk to that girl that is supposedly out of your league and do it in an interesting way, you may just find yourself on her radar real quick.  You don't always have to be the best. There are few things that irritate girls more than a guy who always has to be talking about how he is better than everyone else – at everything.  Everybody has bad days, but it’s up to you to put a positive spin on it. Every gray cloud has a silver lining, as they say, and being able to find it is a very impressive ability.  You don’t have to slay a dragon or rescue them from an evil king. Simply open the door for them, pull out their chair, let them wear your coat if they’re cold, or take their hand to help them out of the car or down some sketchy stairs.  And have some manners, will you please? Girls are not even remotely impressed by burps, farts, or other young boy-type behavior. Far more often than not they find these behaviors crude, annoying, and just plain gross.  Nothing gets a girl’s attention better than a guy who is having a good time with her friends. Not only is the natural competition instinct triggered but she can see immediately that you’re likable and fun and that makes a lasting impression.  This tells her that you don’t care about what else is going on when you’re talking to someone – especially her. The best is when they say something along the lines of, “Your cell phone is ringing.” Why? Because you can let her know that it can’t be anything more important than talking to her. Now that's impressive.  Ask her advice. Ask questions. Compliment her answers, her appearance, a talent you’ve witnessed her display, or her new glasses. Anything new about her or that catches your eye is a great topic to give her kudos on.  It’s just like meeting someone for the first time in person so it’s important to make the same great first impression. Be honest about yourself and show her how you are unique just by being you.  Talk about her  Ask her what her likes/dislikes are.  Ask about her favorite bands.  Find out what her favorite music is.  Send her funny memes or videos.  When you do it at the right time, with the right amount of silliness, cheesy lines like, “Do you believe in love at first sight or should I walk by you again?” can work like a charm. It not only shows your sense of humor but that you’re confident enough to let her know you’re interested in her.  This doesn’t mean reading the directions on the box of mac ’n’ cheese and pulling it off correctly. Go to a website like foodchannel.com and learn how to make it from scratch, practice it, and then do it with confidence in front of her. She’ll be hugely impressed.  If she finds out that you're not who she thinks you are, not only will it be embarrassing, but you will lose some major points as well. If she doesn't like you for who you really are, she's not worth your time and you can do better.  If a girl sees you with your mom or sister and sees you have a good relationship with them and treat them well you have just made your likability soar. This doesn’t mean being obsequious, it means being thoughtful and considerate.  If they also see you playing with nieces/nephews and how much the children adore you? That’s huge bonus points.  Some guys might take this the wrong way so understand: if you’re a T-shirt and jeans guy, then by all means where T-shirts and jeans. But ‘’’clean’’’ T-shirts and ‘’’clean’’’ jeans, not nasty, grungy ones or cheap dime-store ones either. It doesn’t take a designer suit and tie (though if that’s your style then rock it) it just takes some attention to how you look.  Being clean is very important and not just regarding clean clothes. That includes taking showers, washing your hair, brushing your teeth, etc.  They key difference between confidence and arrogance or narcissism is that when you’re confident you’re proud of your accomplishments or whatever it is you’ve done but then you shift the focus of the conversation back onto her (or someone else). It’s not all about you because you know who you are and are fine letting others take some credit as well  ., No one wants to date someone who does nothing in life because that’s boring. Women will be interested in knowing you more intimately if you have a rich and varied set of things that interest you. You should also never be embarrassed by the things that interests you. Is it geeky? Then own up to it because that is a powerful attractor as well.  These topics will also get you speaking passionately, which just takes the whole likability factor to stratospheric levels. Women love passion and showing you have it is key., We all like to be around someone who makes us laugh. For girls it is even more important as it speaks to the level of comfort and confidence that you have in yourself. The key is to make sure that your jokes aren’t at the expense of others. That is a big tip-off that maybe you’re not so confident and need to put down others to feel better about yourself.  This also true of being able to laugh at her jokes, even if they’re not all that funny. Remember, we like to be around funny people but we also like it when people laugh at our jokes.  Laughing out loud, and the ability to do so without reservation, is very appealing as well.  No one likes a yes man. A girl might like it at first – everyone likes to always get their way at first. Eventually, however, it wears thin because you clearly have no opinion and thus no point of view, which is profoundly uninteresting. It could also mean that you don’t respect yourself enough to say what you think, which is also a major turn-off.  It’s scientifically proven that women are more emotionally fulfilled through talking and sharing. This doesn’t mean solving their problems if she’s telling you about them. It means really listening and demonstrating that you’re hearing what they’re telling you.  You can let her know your listening through non-verbal cues, such as smiling, laughing, nodding, or reacting appropriately to the emotions of the story.  Repeat back to her what she said. Not verbatim, but by summarizing what she said both reinforces for her what she’s just told and that you are listening so attentively that you got it.  Nothing makes a girl happier or gives her the warm fuzzies quite like knowing that a guy she is (or even isn’t) thinking about is thinking about her. This can be done in a wide variety of ways, such as:  Sending a link to a YouTube video you think she might like.  Text her a funny Vine.  Unexpectedly invite her to join your group of friends for a night out to a movie, concert, miniature golf, of any other fun activity.  A lot of women will pay attention to one very specific behavior to see what kind of person you really are: how you treat your server at a restaurant. Two other key behaviors they watch is how you treat animals and children. If you score on all of these you just might have some swooning on your hands.  A guy who is capable of leading, of making decisions and getting others to follow them is very attractive to girls. Couple this with being willing to admit mistakes and move on to make the appropriate and necessary changes and you have yourself a winning recipe for getting that girl to like you. Women of all ages like to feel protected and nothing says that like being the man in charge who is adaptable and confident as a leader.

"Marital counseling implies that you are going together to work through relationship issues, but if your focus is individual counseling, you just want your spouse to accompany, and support you, in managing your own individual mental illness. In the first case, your marriage will be the focus of attention. In the second case, helping you and your spouse learn better ways of managing the challenges of your mental illness will be the focus.  If you've determined that you want help for a troubled marriage, be aware that this will be considered your 'diagnosis.' This diagnosis code is V61.1 Relational Problems in the DSM V. Knowing the difference between a 'diagnostic code' and a 'procedural code' will be important when you contact your insurance company.;  , Most contracts have a clause that reads something like this: “A quote of benefits or authorization does not guarantee payment or verify eligibility. Payment of benefits are subject to all terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the member’s contract at time of service.” This means that when you call up your health insurance company, you cannot rely on what the person tells you as a 'fact.' It may be, or it may not be. You are required to know your own health insurance plan.  You are expected to understand what your health insurance policy covers, and what it does not cover. This can be confusing to most people. Most people believe that if a person from your health insurance company tells you it is so, then it is a fact. Not so. You have to be a savvy consumer and know what to ask.  Many policies state that they will pay only for treatment that they consider to be “medically necessary.” This meaning that they have the right to withhold payment if it is considered outside the scope of the policy. This is true even if you have an 'authorization code.'  , Will you be seen alone, with your partner, or with other family members?  The 'Diagnostic Code' is what reason the patient has for seeking treatment. It describes the focus of the treatment, even if the patient has more than one accurate diagnosis. What will your clinician be focused on helping you with? This is the Diagnostic Code.  This is the most confusing part for most people. Your insurance will pay for both spouses being in the room (Procedural Code) and the clerk on the phone will say “Yes, we cover couples counseling,” because they see the Procedural Code “Couples/Family Therapy” on their computer screen. But a Procedural Code (Who’s in the Room) doesn’t kick out the claim. It is the Diagnostic Code that causes the claim to be rejected.  When you read your policy, or call up your insurance company, ask specific questions:  'Do you cover diagnostic code V61.1 used for marriage counseling?' You want to determine whether they consider V61.1 Relational Problems to be a medical necessity.  Some treat code V61.1 differently than other mental disorder diagnoses. If they cover it, ask how many sessions they will cover.  Sometimes health insurance companies will cover a few sessions as 'V61.1 Relational Problems,' and then after these sessions are used, they expect the marriage counselor to label one of you as having a diagnosable mental disorder. You have a right to decide if this will happen, when your counselor is asked to provide such a label, and what that diagnosis will be.  Some people decide that they do not wish to be given a diagnosis of a mental disorder, other than V61.1. They will negotiate with their marriage counselor for an affordable fee, in lieu of being given this diagnosis. This is your right.  Most will agree that marriage problems are stressful. This does not mean that you have to be given a diagnosable mental disorder to see a marriage counselor. If you are going for marriage counseling, that should be your diagnosis. If your health insurance coverage doesn't cover V61.1 Relational Problems, you can look for a better plan, or put your concerns in writing to them. Long-standing marital distress is linked to physical illness, and is nothing to take lightly. Paying now for this sort of help makes good business sense, as well as common sense.  ","determine whether you are going for marriage counseling or individually focused counseling, accompanied by your partner. read your health insurance contract. be savvy as you research. know the lingo before you call your insurance company: 'dates and location of service' is when and where you will be seen; a 'procedure code' is who will be seen. have your questions ready. explore alternative payment options.

"The results must be based on the item's weight (if the situation is on a child) or over the surface area the diaper is supposed to cover.;  , Do this to see just which company has the right fit for your situation, along with providing enough adequate protection so that you can live with the diaper's results.  Remove any old diapers the child or infant might be wearing, and place the new diaper on them.

Although each product is different, small fruits that have a separate skin-layer can even be preserved for a short period of time, when wrapped in a disposable diaper.  Do this if you don't carry any deodorant, or all other deodorant forms have run dry. The amount of perspiration most people will perspire is less than the absorbency of a disposable diaper that has been to protect your baby's groin-muscles. Better yet, it will make your underarm smell baby-fresh for a little while.  Turn the diaper over so the absorbent side is face-down overtop of the mess, and pull the hordes of difficult solids into the diaper by scooping the mess up. With the built-in absorbency power, you can even get wet messes to be cleaned up inside the diaper too. Close the diaper up with the tabs, and throw out the diaper into a trash receptacle when the mess has been cleaned up.  Not only is it sanitary for your baby to be clean; it can also become a clean-up approach for your pampered pooch, if plastic bags aren't available when you go walking with your beloved dog.

Fill each diaper completely with clean water from the tap, and store the diaper in a zipper-closed bag. Place this soaked diaper into the freezer for several hours before use.  The spilled oil can temporarily seep out into the diaper, and you can make your hands less messy and prevent the bolt from dropping into the dark-colored oil collection container.  Everyone who has ever owned a car and has taken a long road trip knows that these diapers can be valuable not just for your baby but for yourself too. Use them when 'nature calls' and a bathroom is not in sight for miles on end.  , Do this if you find it loses heat, or has some holes or scratches where there shouldn't be. Disposable diapers are great for sealing in that warmth, if given the large amount of area to cover with enough diapers around the item.

"These treatments are most effective in late summer through early winter. Spring applications are usually ineffective, but summer applications may bring about moderate levels of removal.Note that the privet must still retain green leaves for foliar treatment to be truly effective. The air temperature should be about 40 degrees Fahrenheit (4 degrees Celsius) or higher.  Avoid spraying foliar treatments on windy days or near water sources.  Look for foliar herbicides with glyphosate as an active ingredient.  More precisely, you should use a concentrated type with 41 percent glyphosate, if not more. 'Ready to Use' formulas generally aren't concentrated enough to work.  Formulas containing a surfactant may also prove more effective than those without one.  Combine 4 to 6 fluid ounces (125 to 185 ml) of herbicide for every 1 gallon (4 L) of water.  Follow the label instructions for more precise measurements.  If the product must be mixed with an additional surfactant, add 0.6 fluid ounces (18 ml) per 1 gallon (4 L) of water.  Use a sprayer to apply the diluted herbicide directly over the privet patch, covering as much as possible.  Single nozzle backpack sprayers are recommended, but you can also use a hose or handgun style sprayer. High-volume handgun sprayers might be most effective when treating high-density patches.  Spray until the entire crown foliage is thoroughly wet, but stop before you create any product runoff.  Work carefully to avoid spraying other plants since the herbicide will kill non-selectively.  For dense privet patches, you may need to repeat another application of herbicide one year after the first treatment.  If dense foliage grew back, you will need to apply more foliar herbicide.  If only one or two stems grow back, you can consider using an herbicide treatment that targets individual plants.  ","apply foliar treatments late in the growing season. purchase an appropriate herbicide. mix the herbicide with water. spray the herbicide onto the privet. repeat if needed. "
"Begin by creating a guest list for the party. Having a set guest list will help you get a sense of how big the location needs to be as well as how much party supplies you will need. You can write the invited guests on a piece of paper or in a spreadsheet. If you are inviting a lot of people to the party, a spreadsheet may be the way to go.You may base the number of people you invite on your budget for the party. If you have a large budget for the party, you may invite a lot of people. A small budget may mean a smaller guest list.  When you make the guest list, be sure to consider any spouses, children, or plus ones in your total tally for the party.  If you are planning the fall themed birthday party for someone else, ask them who they would like to invite.;  , An indoor space may be a good option if you want the party to feel intimate and cozy, especially if it’s going to be a bit nippy outside. You may host the party in your home or rent an indoor space. Look for an indoor space that has a lot of natural light and big windows so guests can admire the fall colors outside.If you have a smaller guest list, an indoor space may be ideal. If you have a lot of people on the guest list, make sure the indoor space can accommodate them all.  An outdoor space may be ideal if you know the weather is going to be crisp and fall-like outside on the date of the party. You may host the party in your backyard or rent an outdoor space. Having the party in your yard can give it a casual, friendly atmosphere.If you decide to use an outdoor space, make sure you have a plan B in case the weather is bad. Your plan B may be moving the party to the following weekend when the weather is better or having it indoors at your house instead.  Make the party feel festive by getting plates, cups, and bowls that have fall images like leaves, pumpkins, and hay bales. Go for plastic cutlery in fall colors or wrap metal cutlery in fall themed napkins.You can also be extra crafty and use halved pumpkins as bowls for the party. Get a large pumpkin, cut it open, and remove the seeds. Then, line it with napkins or use a small plastic bowl and fill it with snacks.  A welcome table in fall colors can be a great way to greet guests as they walk into the party. Get small and large pumpkins for the table as well as fresh flowers in fall colors. You can also add acorns, leaves, and tree branches to the table.Create a birthday garland to drape over the table, spelling out “Happy Birthday” in fall colors.  If you are planning to have a guest book for guests to sign to wish the person happy birthday, put it on the welcome table. Pick a guestbook in fall colors.  If you are having food tables at the party, make centerpieces for them. Put fresh flowers in mason jars or tin cans. Use flowers in reds, oranges, and greens to add to the fall theme. You can also include small pumpkins and gourds as part of the centerpieces.To make the centerpieces more personal, include a funny photograph of the birthday guest of honor.  For a children's party, put toys on the tables as part of the centerpieces.  Hay bales add just the right amount of fall flair to a party. Place hay bales at the welcome table as well as at the food tables. Use hay bales at any activity or game stations at the party.If you are short on chairs, you can cover hay bales with blankets and use them as seats.  If you are going to have food or drinks at the party, determine if you are going to prepare them yourself or hire a catering company. You may hire a bartender to run the bar and ask them to prepare fall-themed cocktails. You can also work with the caterer to come up with a fall themed food menu.Possible food ideas for the party include berry pies, cinnamon donuts, and fried chicken. Drink ideas include apple cider, hot toddies, and cinnamon hot chocolate.  For a children's birthday, you may have fall-themed cupcakes and kid-friendly snacks like chips, mini pizzas, and pigs-in-a-blanket. Make sure you also have kid-friendly drinks like juice, soda, and water.  Make sure you decorate the party space a few hours before the party is set to begin. Ask friends and family to help you set up the supplies and decorations. Assign each person a task so the decorating can get done quickly and efficiently.You may prepare items like the table centerpieces ahead of time so you can just put them out the day of the party.  If you are serving food and drinks at the party, create stations with tables so guests can access the food and drinks easily. You may have a long food table with plates where guests can serve themselves, family style. You can also have a main bar area where guests can order drinks.  If you have a lot of people at the party, you may have more than one food or drink station set up so guests do not have to wait in long lines.  If you are having a fall themed birthday cake for the party, you may set up a separate cake table to showcase the cake.  Have apples in large buckets of water setup for apple bobbing. Put out a craft table for fall themed crafts like leave stenciling or decorating acorns. Have a games table with board games or outdoor games like soccer, badminton, or crochet.You can also arrange sack races or three-legged races, especially if there are going to be kids in attendance.  Another good entertainment for the party could be a live band. Maybe you get a cover band of the birthday guest of honor’s favorite band. Or you may find a fun local band and ask them to play the party.If you can’t afford to hire live entertainment, an iPod or a good playlist on your computer is always a good option. Set up speakers so the music can be heard throughout the party, creating a festive vibe.

"If you already suspect your Labrador retriever is overweight or obese, visit your veterinarian for a checkup. The vet can guide you on the type and quantity of food you should feed your dog, how much weight a month your dog should lose, and your dog’s goal weight.If a health problem, like hypothyroidism, is causing your dog to be overweight you will need to treat the medical condition.  Sometimes, your dog may gain weight because of a medical condition. Hyperadrenocorticism, also known as Cushing's disease, and hypothyroidism can cause weight gain. Hypothyroidism is a condition caused when the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone. This slows metabolism down so the dog’s body has trouble keeping weight under control.In addition to gaining weight or difficulty losing weight, a dog with hypothyroidism may become lethargic, may lose hair, and may seek warm places as it feels cold.  Neutering or spaying a dog can also cause weight gain. A desexed dog requires about 10% less calories than an intact dog due to the decreased demands from the reproductive system.  Overweight and obese dogs are prone to developing serious health problems.Chief among these are developing diabetes.Obese dogs are also at risk to develop painful osteoarthritis due to years of excess weight stressing the bones and joints.  In addition, overweight and obese dogs are at risk for high blood pressure, heart disease, and some forms of cancer.Obese and overweight dogs also have a tendency to be less energetic, sleep more, and to have fewer interactions with their family.

"If you have worms, you may feel an itching in your abdomen that is not normal. This itchiness occurs because the worms release toxins in your body that your immune system responds to like an allergic reaction., Like the itchiness you feel, another reaction that your immune system will produce is a rash. This is again caused by the toxic fluids that the worms leak into our system that causes a hypersensitive reaction in the form of a rash.  The rash will most likely show up as red bumps that might itch.  Some worms can create an obstruction (or blockage) in your intestines. A few worms will causes ulcers, which in turn can cause severe pain in your abdomen. Worms that can cause obstructions in the intestine includeRound worms.  Tapeworms.  Hookworms.  If you have a worm (or worms) in your body, you may experience sudden weight loss without trying to lose weight.

These symptoms are most commonly associated with roundworms. This type of worm has a tendency to travel from the stomach, up into the chest area. When they move, they can cause you to gag because they are a foreign body moving through your system.

"The point of using distraction as a bipolar coping skill is that interrupts a cycle of negative thoughts and behaviors by shifting your attention somewhere else.If your alternative activity isn’t something you enjoy, you won’t fully engage in it, and will likely still be caught in your cycle. Choose distractions that you really enjoy or that will require your full attention.  For example, if you enjoy gardening, then use pruning your roses as a distraction when you’re feeling irritated.  Or, as another example, you might take a break from practicing your guitar for the recital when you notice you’re getting frustrated and do some of your homework as a distraction.;  , This is a great way to distract yourself for a lot of reasons. Being active can help you reduce stress and tension, manage your bipolar disorder, and boost your overall health. It’s also an activity that you can fully immerse yourself in.  Try taking a walk or doing some stretches for a quick distraction that can also energize you and release tension.  Participate in a team or partner sport like tennis, basketball, football, or lacrosse as a way to distract yourself, be fit, and socialize a bit.  You can be productive while distracting yourself if you use the time to organize your schedule and your physical space. Getting organized is not only a way to focus your attention on something less stressful, it’s also a good way to manage your bipolar in general.  Make sure that you have your treatment information organized and easily accessible. For example, you might create a notebook containing emergency treatment information.  Organize your workspace so that you only have materials that you need there. Use trays, cups, baskets, etc. to help you find a home for everything.  Keeping a journal can help you in several ways.It serves as a way to release your feelings and thoughts, keep track of important information like your triggers and signs, and document how well your treatment and coping strategies are working. Writing in your journal is also a really good way to distract yourself.  Writing about your day may help you identify personal triggers and signs that you may need to distract yourself.  Instead of focusing on what has you upset, focus on writing about how you are feeling, why you might feel this way, and what you can do about it.  This is another positive and productive way to distract yourself. Meditation can help relieve physical tension, clear your mind, and calm and relax you. It’s something that you can do no matter where you are. And it’s also something that you can do for as long or as short a time as you need.  Make yourself as comfortable as possible. If you can, go somewhere quiet where you can sit or lie without being disturbed.  Focus on your breathing. Think about it as you slowly inhale through your nose, hold it in your belly, and then release it through your mouth.  Try not to think about anything but your breathing. If your mind wanders, gently bring your thoughts back to your breathing.  Using alcohol and drugs to distract yourself from your present situation is unhealthy, but there are other things you can do instead. In some cases you will need to distract yourself but also remain focused on what you’re doing. For example, if you’re driving and find yourself getting stressed because of traffic, meditating isn’t the best distraction. When this happens you can still use distraction as a coping skill, you just need to do something that won’t make the situation dangerous for you.  Try deep-breathing exercises. You can do this anytime and anywhere. For instance, you can distract yourself from stand-still traffic by focusing on your breathing like you do during mediation.  Recite a mantra. Memorize some encouraging words or even a poem or prayer that you can silently recite to yourself as a form of distraction.  Focus on relaxing one part of your body at a time. For example, if you’re in a meeting and feel tense you can distract yourself by thinking, “I’m relaxing my toes” as you wiggle and flex your toes. Do this with each body part or until you are calmer.  ","choose engaging distractions. do something active. get organized. try journaling. practice meditation. choose safe distractions. "

"This is the simplest exercise for legs. Use a step counter. You should try to walk about 10,000 steps each day.  To make walking seem less tiring, try slipping on some flat shoes or sneakers when you get around. If you keep this up, you'll see results in a month.;  , Running will use more energy and in turn help burn fat. Try to do this at least three times per week. However, make sure to start slow and gradually increase your running time.  When running, choose a route that is particularly flat. Up-hill helps build the muscles of the legs and buttocks.  Bike riding provide a shockingly high caloric burn of about 500-600 calories an hour, making it one of the best exercise for reducing body fat. However, you will only burn this many calories if you work up a sweat and get your heart rate into the range of 70 to 85% of your maximum.  Lay flat on your back with your legs on the floor. Put your arms out beside you on the floor. Bring your knee up to where the highest part of your profile is. Then, with your other leg, kick it as high as it will go. Return it to the floor. Do 60 of these kicks, then switch sides and do 60 more.  Lie on your right side and place your left arm on the floor in front of you for support and balance. With your left leg, raise it at hip level. Pretend your leg is in a barrel and with your toes, lead the rest of your leg to trace the inside of the barrel. Do 60 circles and then switch and do 60 more.  Rebounding uses a lot of calories and you have fun at the same time. It also exercises your muscles leading to a more toned appearance.  Lunges are a great way to tone your legs. Try to include lunges into your strength training routine twice per week. To do a lunge:Stand with your feet shoulder width apart and take a big step forward.  As you step forward, bend your knees and lower yourself down until your front knee is at about a 90 degree angle.  Make sure that the knee of you front leg stays over your ankle.  Hold for a second and then step back into the starting position.  Repeat the exercise on your opposite side. Do three sets of 10 to 15 repetitions on each side.  Squats will tone your buttocks and legs, so this is another great strength training exercise to include. Include squats into your strength training routine twice per week as well. To do a squat:Stand with your feet a bit wider than shoulder width apart.  Then, slowly lower your buttocks towards the ground as if you are going to sit down. Extend your arms out in front of you as you do this to help you balance. You can even place a chair behind you to help you practice.  Do not allow your knees to go past your toes as you do this exercise.  Hold for a few seconds when you reach the deepest squat you can comfortably achieve.  Then, slowly raise yourself back up.  Repeat the exercise 10 to 15 times and do three sets.  Go to a public pool when it's not too crowded. If you are a newbie to swimming laps, start out small. As you get better, do more laps. Try to do this 1-2 times a week. Swimming helps you gain muscle and burn fat.  While lying on a mat or bed, place the ball in front of you. Place your legs on top of the ball, lift your hips up, and slowly roll the ball in towards your hips. Do this until you can no longer go anymore and make sure your hips don't fall to the floor.  Using an incline can build calf muscle. Keep the resistance low.  Protein is filling and good for maintaining muscle tone. Make sure to include fish, chicken and turkey in your diet.  Fruits and veggies provide you with dietary fiber, which can help reduce the amount of fat that your body stores.  You should be drinking 8-10 glasses per day. Water not only helps flush out accumulated toxins in your body, but also keeps your skin hydrated, smooth and glowing in summer.  Foods like cookies, ice cream, cake, and chocolate are not only full of empty calories that don't provide you with energy, but will simply store themselves in your legs.  These types of foods prevent your skin from remaining hydrated. Examples include peanuts, potato chips, popcorn, and most microwaveable foods.  The body converts fat into energy when it's exercising or low on food. Unfortunately, the body converts fat from wherever it wants, and not always where you want it to.  Spot-training, or working one area of your body at a time, has its advantages (toning) and disadvantages (frustration when fat doesn't magically disappear). Don't expect leg exercises to give you suddenly-skinny legs without seeing a reduction in your overall body fat levels.  A lot of people who want to lose weight make this mistake. Their reasoning: Calories get stored as fat when the body doesn't use them; calories come from food; if I starve myself, I'll get fewer calories; if I get fewer calories, there will be less fat to store. This is a misconception.  What happens when a person starves him/herself? The body realizes it is getting less food, your metabolism slows down to save energy, and you start consuming lean tissue instead of fat reserves because the body wants to prepare itself for a while without food.  If you do manage to lose weight by starving yourself (you did it the hard, painful way!) your body will gain all the fat back as soon as you begin eating again, and you should eat again. Why is this? Because your metabolism is still hibernating, and it needs to be kick-started. How do you kickstart it? By eating the right types of foods in the first place.  A lot of people with really good intentions and strong discipline quit just before they start to see results. They work like crazy for a month, don't see any results, and throw their hands up in the air in despair. Try to remember that slow and steady wins the race. It is reasonable to lose one to two pounds per week. At this pace, your muscles will begin to be visible at around eight weeks into your program. Go slow and try to embrace any changes you make as lifestyle changes.  Some people have bigger legs because of genetics and you cannot change that. Whatever exercise, diet, or fad you do cannot change you because that's the way you were born. Instead of fighting the world and running after a fool's errand, accept who you are and embrace it. It sounds cheesy, but you'll be happier in the end. Anybody who genuinely cares about you won't care one bit if you have skinny legs or not.

Look for a cheap yet decent instrument.  You can use them as warm-ups while your group is still thinking of more additions to the band.  Of course, every song about the Lord is absolutely great, but try to aim for uncommon beats and sounds. Later on, it might be heard in churches all over the world.  If you are committing huge sins every day and are not caring, singing your christian songs is like acting. Try to pray every day and appreciate what you have. Remember, Christians try to be as close to the Lord as possible. But, everyone makes mistakes. You only have to ask for forgiveness.  If not, the band can end up breaking up or friendships can be lost. Also,try not to have a relationship(boyfriend/girlfriend) in your band because all loving couples argue and this can lead to many dead ends.  Don't focus all on the band.

"Some believe the color red is nourishing to the root chakra. To begin the healing process, try to imagine the color red. When meditating, picture red. If you have dull moments throughout the day, close your eyes and think about the color red. This may help heel your root chakra., Both dance and yoga may help heal the root chakra. You can simply dance alone in your room, as no special dance routine is required to heal the root chakra. As for yoga, think about attending a yoga class or taking guided yoga courses online. Poses like tree pose and half lotus are particularly helpful for healing the root chakra.You can continue to visualize the color red during yoga and dance. This may help with the healing process.  Being outdoors can help heal any chakra, but especially the root chakra. As the root chakra is found at the bottom of your body, being mindful of your steps can help. Focus on the feeling you get when your feet lift and hit the ground. Strive to be mindful of the sensations in your lower body during your walk.If you don't have time to take long walks, try to walk more throughout the day. You could, for example, walk to work instead of taking a bus or walk to the store instead of driving.  As your root chakra is associated with the bottom part of your body, caring for your feet can help keep this chakra strong. Pamper your feet a little to promote energy in your root chakra. Get a pedicure or foot massage. When you take a shower, pay extra attention to washing your feet. Try buying a special foot cream or moisturizer., Some believe your second chakra responds very well to water. As negative feelings like guilt and shame can commonly affect the second chakra, water can create a cleansing sensation to help wash away these feelings. Try to submerge yourself in water to heal the second chakra.Go for a swim at a local beach or pool.  Take a long bath. Add baking soda or sea salt for an extra soothing bath.  For the best effect, spend at least 20 minutes submerged in water.  Physical movement, especially outdoors, can help heal the third chakra. Spend time outdoors getting physically active. Go for walks, runs, or bike rides when the sun is out. It can be especially effective to get outdoors close to sunrise or sunset., The fourth chakra is related to touch and may heal via physical contact. Try to get close to others. Work on being more physically intimate via gestures like hugs or cuddling with loved ones. This may help your fourth chakra heal.If you're uncomfortable getting physically close to other people, spend time with a pet that likes to cuddle., Your fifth chakra can be healed via sound therapy. Chanting, mantras, and singing can help heal your fifth chakra. You can also listen to music to help your fifth chakra heal., Your sixth chakra is strongly related to your dreams. Meditation routines that involve heavy visualization can help heal this chakra. Practice meditation routines that involve closing your eyes and imaging a relaxing scene, using all your senses to make the scene feel as vivid as possible.If you struggle with visualization, try taking a class on meditation that involves visualization or find guided routines online.  Intense meditation, that involves clearing the mind and focusing on the present moment, can help heal the seventh and final chakra. This involves silent meditation where you try to keep your mind as thoughtless as possible.This type of meditation can be challenging, so consider taking a meditation class or looking for guided routines online.  Meditation works best in a quiet room free of distractions. You should also make sure you wear comfortable clothing and sit in a comfortable position.  Chakras are associated with the body. A full body massage can help heal all your chakras. While you're in the process of healing one chakra at a time, book a massage to help speed up the process.See if you can find a massage therapist who specializes in chakra healing massages.  Some new age stores sell what are known as chakra stones. These are healing crystal sold in different representing each chakra. If you want to help speed up the healing process, try investing in a full set of chakra stones.To use your chakra stones, you lay the stones on top of the corresponding chakra. For your root chakra, for example, you would lay the stone on your groin or feet.Some stones, like clear quartz, can be used to heal multiple chakras.  If you don't feel as if your chakras are healing, talk to a professional. You can find a professional energy healer online or at a new age store. Professional energy healers can help you identify which chakras need work and form a plan to get your chakras healed.Keep in mind, however, that healing your chakras may not solve issues like depression and anxiety or physical problems like lethargy. There is very limited medical research and no thorough medical evidence to back up the idea of chakras. If you suffer from mental or physical difficulties, see a medical professional for proper evaluation.

"If you can’t, then limit the damage by closing doors and windows (which should also keep the fire calm for a few moments).  , Don’t use water for obvious reasons.  Unfortunately, you’re going to have a mess. Use a vacuum to remove residue from the floors; warm water and powdered detergent applied with a soft cloth is the best way to remove soot marks from the walls.

"It's easy to let your thoughts spin out of control when you're anxious. If you, say, hear a strange noise, your mind may jump to the worse case scenario. Remember, your mind tends to play tricks on you when you're anxious. Try to be aware of what you're thinking, and take control of troublesome thoughts.Your brain can make you believe a lot of irrational things when you're anxious. Most of them are not true. When you start to get nervous, think to yourself, 'This is just my brain playing a trick on me.'  Many people get nervous over strange sounds when home alone. When you hear a strange noise, look for a logical explanations instead of assuming there's an intruder in the house. For example, think something like, 'I think that is an intruder, but that's my anxiety talking. I know I locked the doors. The cat probably knocked something over upstairs.', You should question any thoughts you have that don't seem rational when you're home alone. When you start to get scared over a particular scenario, stop and ask yourself something like, 'Honestly, what is the worst thing that can happen here?'For example, you may get more nervous as it gets dark out. You may think something like, 'I'm going to have a heart attack I'm so scared.'  Stop and question this. Ask yourself something like, 'Am I really going to have a heart attack? What is the worst thing that could actually happen?'  In reality, you know you won't have a heart attack just from being nervous. Say something to yourself like, 'The worst thing that can happen is that I'll feel scared for a few hours. Feeling scared sucks, but it won't actually hurt me.'  , Simply breathing can help release tension and ground you in reality. If you start to get nervous home alone, do some simple deep breathing exercises to calm down and return your mind to the present.Inhale through your nose. Make sure to direct your breath in such a way that your diaphragm rises while your chest remains relatively still. Hold the breath for a count of four.  Exhale through your mouth. Try to spend seven seconds exhaling.  Repeat deep breathing a few times. You should feel significantly calmer.  Your imagination can really run wild when you're upset. Instead of letting your imagination scare you, redirect it. Envision a calming scenario when your thoughts start to spiral towards anxiety.When you start to feel nervous, go on a mental vacation. Imagine yourself somewhere relaxing where you can unwind.  For example, picture yourself lying on a beach somewhere. Engage with all your senses. What does this scene look like, feel like, taste like? Close your eyes and imagine until you being to feel calm.  ","acknowledge your mind is playing tricks on you. question nervous thoughts. practice deep breathing. visualize a calming scenario. "
"This is a plant that is happy to sit on the windowsill provided it doesn't get too hot. The preferred temperature is average warmth, although the cooler the room, the happier the plant will be.;  , It doesn't need a lot of watering. Too much watering can bring about root rot but too dry and the leaves will shrivel and turn yellow.  However, if you don't remember, it'll still thrive. A standard liquid fertiliser is appropriate.  Otherwise, don't worry about it. It's really only an aesthetics issue.  Rather than trying to keep the plant flourishing after flowering, it's recommended that you take cuttings from it and grow new ones for the next year. And so on, for as long as you like. Cuttings should be placed in a soil-based compost.

"The Pap test or pap smear tests for cervical cancer and the human papillomavirus (HPV) test checks for changes in cells that could cause cancer. During a Pap test, the doctor will place a special tool (speculum) inside your vagina to swab for cells. This is sent to a lab for examination. If you're menstruating, have had sex (or used contraceptive jellies or foams), or douched, wait at least two days before getting the Pap smear. Follow the Centers for Disease Control's recommended Pap schedule:Women over 21 should get a Pap test and HPV screening once every three years if the results are normal.  Women over 30 should get a Pap and HPV test once every five years if the results are normal.  Women under age 65 should continue getting Pap tests until age 65 or until getting a total-hysterectomy for non-cancerous conditions.;  , HPV is a group of viruses that are directly connected to cervical, vaginal and vulvar cancer. To make the vaccine more effective, it is usually given as a series of three shots to girls starting at the age of 9 and boys starting at the ages of 11 or 12. If you haven't already gotten it at an early age, the HPV vaccine is recommended for:Girls and women between the ages of 13 and 26  Boys and men between the ages of 13 to 21  Men who have sex with men through age 26  Men with compromised immune systems through age 26  , If you're overweight or obese and don't get much physical activity, you could be at a higher risk for uterine cancer. Try to lose weight by eating a healthy diet and becoming physically active. Talk with your doctor or a registered dietitian to create a personalized diet. Avoid processed foods, eat more vegetables and fruits, and choose lean protein sources.Your doctor or dietitian may recommend reducing your intake of animal fat, which appears to increase the risk of gynecological cancers.  Smoking is associated with cervical, vaginal and vulvar cancers. If you're struggling to quit or even cut back, talk with your doctor, who can recommend support groups or cessation aids.You can use nicotine replacement therapies (like patches or gums) or smoking cessation medications, which may help smokers quit.  If you're taking an estrogen therapy alone, you may actually increase your risk for uterine cancer (if you have a uterus). But, if you take estrogen plus progesterone together as a hormone replacement therapy, you can reduce that cancer risk, though this may increase your risk for breast cancer. You can also reduce your uterine or breast cancer risk by taking oral contraceptives that contain these hormones.Progesterone treatment can be used to treat uterine cancer in some situations.  Talk with your female family members about their medical histories, especially close relatives like your mother, sisters, aunts and grandmothers. Some cancers are linked to gene mutations. If a close family member has a cancer caused by a gene mutation (like ovarian or breast cancers), you might benefit from genetic testing and counseling.When you talk with your family about their medical histories, find out how old they were when cancers were diagnosed. Remember to get information from both sides of your family., Cervical cancer is more common in women over 30 and is commonly caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). Your risk factors are higher if you smoke, are infected with HIV/AIDS, or have a suppressed immune system. Using oral contraceptives for five years or more, giving birth to three or more children, or having several sexual partners can all increase your risk as well.Early cervical cancer often has no symptoms, but advanced cervical cancer can cause vaginal bleeding or an abnormal discharge.  Talk with your family to find out if close female relatives have a history of ovarian cancer since this may increase your risk. You may be at a higher risk if you're middle-aged or older, have a genetic mutation like BRCA1 or BRCA2 (or are of an Ashkenazi Jewish background which is associated to these mutations), or have a history of breast, colon, rectal, cervical or skin cancer. Endometriosis and a history of taking estrogen (without progesterone) may also be risk factors. Watch for symptoms of ovarian cancer that include:Abnormal bleeding or discharge  Pain in the lower part of your abdomen  Back pain  Bloating  Feeling full after eating only a small amount of food  Changes in how often you urinate  , Find out if you have a close family member who has had uterine, colon or ovarian cancer since this can increase your risk. Your risk for uterine cancer is also higher if you're over 50 years old, are obese, use estrogen replacement therapy alone (without progesterone), or have had irregular periods or difficulty getting pregnant. Women who have used a drug called tamoxifen to treat some forms of breast cancer also have an increased risk for uterine cancer.Symptoms of uterine cancer are abnormal bleeding or abnormal discharge, especially in post-menopausal women. Women with advanced uterine cancer may experience pain or a sense of pressure in the lower abdomen, but this is rare.  Cancers of the vagina (the birth canal) and the vulva (the outer part of the genitals) are very rare. Your risk factors for these cancers are higher if you're infected with HPV, have a history of cervical abnormalities or cervical cancer, you smoke, or you have chronic itching or burning around the vulva. Get medical attention if you notice symptoms of these cancers which include:Abnormal bleeding or discharge  Blood in your stool or urine  Urinating more frequently  Pain the the lower abdomen (especially during sex)  Itching or burning sensation around your vulva  A rash or physical changes (like warts) around your vulva  ","get regular gynecological exams. get the human papillomavirus (hpv) vaccine. talk with your doctor about your diet. consult with your physician about quitting smoking. get hormone treatments. consider getting genetic testing. consider your risk for cervical cancer. determine your risk for ovarian cancer. recognize your risk for uterine cancer. consider your risk for vaginal and vulvar cancers. "
"Focus on 3 sets of 8-10 and hit each leg group. The goal is to work the muscles in ways that will maximize their ability to generate power over extended periods as well as to work stabilizer muscles that are under-trained in most runners. 3 sets of 8-10 works the body past pure power lifting (creating phosphate energy), but remains within the range for maximum strength benefits. Lifting helps extend the potential to increase power, which increases potential stride length, and thus the potential to run faster, especially if lean muscle mass and not bulk is added. Replace every 4th lifting day with plyometrics to ensure maximal conversion of strength training to explosiveness and fast running.  Emphasis needs to be placed on abductor/adductor exercises to help prevent injuries from overpronation and knee tracking issues (i.e. imbalances causing the knee to not glide on the patellar joint and instead irritate the cartilage), including but not limited to IT band syndrome, shin splints, tendinitis, etc.  Example Schedule: Day 1=Squats, Abductor, Adductor, Calve raises. Day 2= Lunges, Leg Extension, Leg Curl. Make sure to include core, including back extensions and abdominal crunches as well as some chest and shoulder exercises to assist with form.  Other lifts that should be included focus on the lower back and hip flexors, muscles that are often ignored. Deadlifts, Split-Squats, Glute-Ham Raise, Straight Leg Extensions, and barbell step-ups onto a knee high platform are great ways to develop strength in these muscles.  Lifting sessions should be less than one hour. To do this, utilize circuit type training approaches (i.e. while taking rest from squats, do pull-ups).  Recovery should include a protein/carbohydrate snack within one hour to maximize anabolism (protein assists in the ingestion of carbohydrate. A balanced diet should contain enough protein, so protein shakes are unnecessary - the body can produce a majority of amino acids). A nice glass of chocolate milk is ideal.  A non-lifting way to achieve the same objectives is to incorporate soccer or Frisbee or basketball once a week to help work on stabilizer muscles, explosiveness, and reinforce turnover. Football players rarely have an issue with over striding or slow turnover for a reason.;  , The anaerobic system can reach 95% of its potential training for 6 weeks. Therefore, the only training that should be done in the summer should focus on aerobic conditioning and strength training. This can either be a cross country training program, or can be something consisting of the following:  One long run per week to build up oxidative enzymes (up to 15 miles (24 km), but no more than 1/4 of weekly mileage), 2 days of hill sprints including form drills (lead-yard bounding is recommended, see images and search for Lydiard foundation), 2 days of lifting, and just plenty of mileage until you are up to at least 30 miles (48 km) per week.  Mileage is very important to most 800 runners. While elite sprint types can normally get away with 30-40 mpw, most elite 800 runners need to build base at 50 mpw up to 70-80 to maximize fitness and to consolidate aerobic gains.  Note: Unless you have hit a mileage before, do not increase more than 10% or 3 miles (4.8 km) in a given week. For example, For someone running 60 mpw, mileage by week coming off of a break would be 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 35, 45, 50, 53, 55, 50, 55, 58, 60. Note that as the mileage increases to near maximum, the increase in mileage per week slows and lower mileage weeks are built in for recovery. Most 800 runners have a need to taper mileage every third week by ~20-30% (i.e. w1=60, w2=60, w3=45, w4=60...) in order to prevent physical and mental burnout. Build this into your schedule!  , After the mileage is built up, start including strides at the 800 meter date pace. For example, 12 x 100 @ 800 with 300 jog. This is to reinforce speed principles and build muscle memory/efficiency without straining and/or compromising aerobic conditioning. Also include 5K workouts (i.e. x mins @ 5K pace, x minutes recovery, where x starts at 2 and works up to 3-5 minutes for a maximum of 20-25 minutes). A great way to ensure that you are not overworking your athletes, but to keep hammering the different physiological systems is to do three week mini-cycles (i.e. in a 3 week span, you do 1 tempo runs, 1 day of cruise intervals, 2 days of 5K intervals, 1 day of 3K intervals, and 1 day of 200 meter hills, so 33% of the workouts are lactate threshold, 33% are VO2, and 33% are efficiency (At vVO2 or 1500/800 effort).  This can also be done at threshold pace for those focusing on XC (workout would be x mins @ slightly slower than 10K pace with 1 min recovery, starting at 2 minutes and working up to 6-10 minutes). Threshold pace is the pace at which a steady state of lactic acid is accumulated in the blood (~ 4 mM). Additional effort will cause a significant increase in lactic acid accumulation and will not improve your body's ability to buffer lactic acid and to clear it. Thus, it is an effort and not a pace.  Sample week: Sunday: 15 miles (24 km), Monday: 6 miles (9.7 km) + 6 x Hills, Tuesday: 4 x 6 min @ T with one min jog, LIFT. Wednesday: OFF Thursday: 10 miles (16 km) + Hill Sprints. Friday: 6 miles (9.7 km) + 12 x 100 @ 800, LIFT, Saturday: 8 miles (13 km) easy.  Start including intervals @ 5K pace. Intervals can start @ 400's and work up to intervals that take between 3-5 minutes (for example, 6 x 1K @ 5K with equal time recovery). Distance running increases mitochondria, increases the number of capillaries, and increases stroke volume, decreasing heart rate (aka, the infrastructure). VO2 max training on the other hand increases the ability of the body to take oxygen, absorb it into the blood stream, and subsequently deliver it to muscles (think the cars using the infrastructure) while threshold training helps to eliminate byproducts of training (think maintenance crews). Thus, they are all important and all have their place. VO2 max workouts should replace the Friday workout, which can replace hill sprints one of the days or can move to Saturday. At this point, the runner should be in great aerobic fitness and strong, but not 'fast'. Downhill sprints or sprints that are wind assisted should be incorporated to reinforce turnover.  Now it is time to concentrate on race specificity. Workouts should now be 3 days a week and can often work on a 14 day cycle (i.e. every 14 days includes 1 VO2 max workout (aka 5K pace), 1 threshold workout, 1 workout at vVO2 (aka 3K pace), 1 workout @ 1500 pace, and 2 workouts @ 800/400 pace). For example, work from 8 x 300 @ 1500 date pace to 5 x 600 @ 1500 date pace. Interval length should for the most part be no longer than half of the race and the total distance at this pace should be no more distance than 2.5 times race distance (at that point, if you can run that, it's not your race pace, or you are recovering too long!). You can also run race simulations (600 @ 800 or 400 @ 800, 1 min, 200 @ 800).  Make SURE to keep up the work focusing on turnover, otherwise the 400 will suffer. Running the 4x4 at every indoor meet is a good way to turn a race into a full speed workout.  Take days easy/off as necessary for races, but train through (i.e. don't take 3 days off to recover for a dual meet).  Lifting should cut back to one day per week to account for the increased intensity of workouts, but can be replaced by plyometrics (depth jumps, alternate leg step-up jumps on an appropriate bench, alternate leg bounds, straight legged jumps (calve workout), etc.).  Now is the time to blast the anaerobic system. My favorite workout is 8-12 x 200 @ 800 meter date pace (pace you could run that day) with a 200 meter jog. This workout will give your body superior ability to buffer lactic acid, be relatively stress free mentally, and is just a good third workout. Running 4 x 400 at 800 meter date pace is a fantastic way to teach your body to run fast through fatigue. Practice running these date-pace type workouts with intervals both at 'first lap pace' (i.e. goal pace - 2 seconds) and 'second lap pace' (I.e goal pace + 2 seconds).  Lifting should be minimized and focus should be on form building plyometrics.  Focus should be on longer intervals (i.e. 400's at 800 meter date pace) and should work towards goal pace (i.e. 5-6 x 300 at 800 meter goal pace with ample recovery).  Increased focus on training at 400 pace should also be included, as the 800 time is in part limited by speed endurance, i.e. how fast one can run the 400 (400 time x 2 + 12 seconds = rough ceiling).  A taper should be a slight cut down on quantity, a slight increase in quality, and a few extra days easy before race. We are natural hunters and gatherers. Therefore, cutting back mileage excessively will cause your body to go into hibernation mode. A workout such as 200, 300, 300, 200 for goal pace race simulation is a great easy workout, followed by 6 x 150 @ 400 to reinforce speed and turnover. Again, do not cut your mileage by more than 20%, but thresholds and VO2 work should be minimized (i.e., no more than 10 minutes a week of efforts at these paces to reinforce maintenance of physiological adaptations).  Take two weeks off to recuperate for the coming year. Lifting is encouraged, but other than that, have fun!  ","start with strength training. increase total fitness during the base season, aka early summer. increase the intensity during the late summer period to include high-end aerobic work and start race specific work. increase training in the fall. continue in the winter. pick up the pace in spring. taper. relax post-season.

"These aches, also known as reactive arthritis, can indicate that a chlamydia infection.Approximately one percent of men with urethritis will develop reactive arthritis, and approximately one-third of these patients have the complete reactive arthritis triad (RAT) formerly referred to as Reiter syndrome (arthritis, uveitis, and urethritis).Scrotal pain and swelling is the most common. If left untreated, as the chlamydia progresses, you will have a feeling of fullness in your abdomen, caused by infection in the epididymus, that leads to these other lower body aches.  If you recently engaged in oral sex and have a sore throat, you could have contracted chlamydia from your partner this way, even if he wasn’t showing any symptoms.Transmission of chlamydia is possible from penis-to-mouth, as well as through vaginal and anal sex.  Men with chlamydia may develop a fever and become nauseated, especially if the infection has spread to the ureters.A fever is generally anything higher than 37.3C or 99F.  ","watch for lower back, abdominal, and general pelvic pain. monitor a sore throat. watch for nausea or fever. "
"Studies have shown that this drug may be effective in treating inflammation that occurs as a result of osteoarthritis.This herb acts by reducing the enzyme that degrades cartilage therefore helping bones to become stronger.  This herb can be found in a cream form that can be applied on the affected joints three times per day, or according to the instructions of your doctor.  A study that was done by a journal called Phytomedicine showed that 30 patients who had been treated using this drug experience a reduction in knee pain. These patients also reported that they had improved function of the knees and could walk for longer that they were able to before.;  , Studies have shown that this drug can also be used to reduce swelling in the joints, and to treat conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis.  Boswellia cream can be rubbed on the painful joints and it can also be taken orally to help with pain relief. When the cream is being applied to the painful joints, it is advisable to follow the instructions of the manufacturer.  The recommended dosage in the treatment of arthritis is 400 mg thrice daily. The acid that is contained in boswellia is effective in reducing inflammation, as it deactivates the hormones that cause the inflammation in the first place.  Boswellia has anti-inflammatory properties and is effective in the treatment of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.  There is a special extract in boswellia called H15 that helps to reduce inflammation in bowel diseases. Ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease are conditions that are caused by an inflammation in the gastrointestinal system.  The recommended dosage in the treatment of Crohn’s disease is 1200 mg, taken three times daily. The dosage for ulcerative colitis is 350 to 400 mg three times daily.  A study that was done showed that the extracts of boswellia have proven to be as effective as mesalazine. This is the drug of choice used in treatment of ulcerative colitis., Boswellia can help in the reduction of leukotrines that usually cause the contraction of the bronchial muscles. When the bronchial muscles contract the patient is unable to breathe easily and this is one of the symptoms of asthma.  The herb also helps to reduce the synthesis of leukotrines that cause inflammation in the body. When leukotrienes are overproduced in the body, the immune system is activated and this leads to an asthma attack.  One study showed that people who used boswellia had reduced symptoms of asthma. Another study that was done in Germany in 1998 showed that the herb could be used to cure asthma.The recommended dosage when it is used in treatment of asthma is 300-400 mg three times daily.  The herb contains boswellic acids that help to reduce and stop the growth of cancer. These acids help to prevent the negative effect of certain enzymes on DNA.  Studies have also shown that the herb can fight breast cancer in the advanced stages.It can also reduce the spread of cancer in brain tumor and malignant leukemia. Boswellic acid is also effective in reducing the spread of cancer in pancreatic tumors., Boswellia can be applied externally on skin that is chapped and dry. Boswellia helps in the rejuvenation and renewal of the skin because it promotes development and growth of new cells.It also helps in the production of sebum, which prevents the skin from drying out.  This gives the skin a more youthful appearance, which is why most skin products have boswellia as one of their ingredients.  It is advisable to follow the instructions of the manufacturer when using boswellia in the treatment of skin problems.  It is also important to speak to your doctor before using any herbal products.  The recommended dosage of boswellia capsules is 300 to 500 milligrams orally, taken three times daily. However, this dosage may be higher in patients who suffer from inflammatory bowel disease.  Products that contain 60% of ingredients that are made from boswellic acids can be taken three times per day. The recommended dosage of these products is 300 to 400 mg.  It is recommended that you stop taking the drug after 8-12 weeks, because the safety of ingesting the drug for a longer period has not been proven.  This herb should not be used by pregnant women because it stimulates the flow of blood in the pelvis and the uterus. This increases the flow of blood when one is menstruating and can induce miscarriage in pregnant women.  ","use boswellia to manage osteoarthritis. reduce swelling caused by rheumatoid arthritis with boswellia. use this extract as a treatment for inflammatory bowel disease. consider using boswellia if you have asthma. understand that some cancer patients have found this extract helpful. use boswellia in the treatment of chapped skin. always read the instructions.there are various different products containing boswellia, and the instructions for each vary therefore, it is important to follow the specific instructions that are given by the manufacturer. know that the dosage may vary depending on your condition. stop taking the drug after you have used it for 8 to 12 weeks. do not take boswellia if you are pregnant.

"Use the shovel to put gravel into the grizzly, and shake it through the holes in the grizzly. Inspect all oversized rocks and other materials for possible gold nuggets, and toss anything that is not gold back into the stream.;  , Squat down by the edge of the stream, and submerge a half-full gold pan in gently moving stream water between your knees. Point the pan riffles away from your body so that you can catch any gold that emerges over the pan's lip. Throw back any pebbles into the stream. Break up clay balls in case any placer gold is trapped inside them. When the water inside the pan clears up, the clay is gone and you can start panning.  Shake the pan sideways or in a circular motion while keeping it completely submerged underwater. Be on the lookout for heavy, unusually shaped or colored pieces that sink to the bottom of the pan. If you have gold, it will settle to the bottom of the pan.  If you see dark, heavy mineral grains, you are panning correctly. These minerals could contain precious and semiprecious stones such as magnetite, garnet, scheelite, zircon, cassiterite, and platinum, so look out for them as well as for gold.  As a general rule, if you find something heavy, keep it for later analysis. A geologist or miner will be able to identify the items you find.  Use a magnet to separate magnetic grains from everything else. Use tweezers to pick up possible small gold pieces. If you find any possible small pieces of gold, save them in a water-filled vial.  ","position the grizzly over your gold pan. prepare for the gold panning process. begin panning for gold. tilt the pan sideways occasionally to let sand and other small materials wash away. do your final panning over a container so you don't lose any small gold pieces that could possibly be in your pan.

"The best and simplest way to remove anything oily or greasy from any fabric is by generously applying a concentrated dish detergent directly to the stain. It contains no harsh chemicals so you don't have to worry about it damaging the fabric. Dish detergent is formulated to cut through grease plain and simple. Using a small brush (old toothbrushes work great!) scrub the stain in a circular motion for several minutes. Keep pouring on the detergent if needed. Allow the fabric to rest for 30 minutes or so at least before placing in the washing machine. Wash in warm water on heavy duty cycle. This method uses only one ingredient and works wonderfully!;  , As soon as you’re able, pour a small amount of baby powder all over the fresh grease stains on your clothing. The baby powder is fine enough that it will fill in the crevices between the fibers, and absorb the grease. Leave the baby powder to ‘soak’ for 10-15 minutes, and then brush it off. If the grease is still faintly visible, toss it in the washing machine under cold water. The combination should do the trick, and by the time the clothing has dried, there should be no trace of grease left!  , Because chalk is such a fine powder, it easily absorbs the grease in your clothes and makes it easy to remove. Fill in your grease stain with plain white chalk, or scrape some of the powder over the stain. Allow it to set for 10-15 minutes and then rub it off. If the stain is still visible, you can wash it with cold water. The rinse/dry cycle will finish the task and should fully remove the stain.  Yes, another one of the fine powders (just like baby powder and chalk), cornstarch works wonders at soaking up fresh grease and oil stains. Pour a small amount of the powder on the stain and allow it to set for a quarter of an hour. You can brush off the cornstarch afterwards, or leave it on and put it in the washing machine. Wash your clothes on ‘cold’, and your grease stain should be gone!  , Don’t have any of the aforementioned powders on hand? Try using talcum powder to remove the stains. Follow the same process as explained above by pouring a small amount of the powder onto the grease stain, and allowing it to soak for 10-15 minutes. When it’s had a bit of time to soak up the grease, throw the clothing into the washing machine and wash it on ‘cold’.  This solution works best for stains on thicker fabrics, such as denim or linen. Mix together one part salt with three parts rubbing alcohol, and then pour it onto the grease stain. Use a soft cloth to rub the mixture into the stain, working it into the fibers. Allow the solution to soak for 10-15 minutes, and then wash your clothing as you normally would. By the time the clothing has been washed and dried, their should be a missing grease spot!, There’s a reason they use dish soap to clean up oil spills - they are great at dissolving tough oil stains. Find a dish soap that is used for the purpose of dissolving oil (these often have a special type of oil-eating bacteria as an ingredient). Cover the grease stain with the dish soap, and rub it in gently with a soft cloth. Then, throw your clothing into the washing machine and run it under the normal settings. Your clothing should be grease-free after a single wash, but you can repeat the process again if it’s not., If you’re up for spending a few bucks, pick up a specialty dry cleaning solution used for cleaning up grease stains. These are typically spray-on or iron-on liquids that are applied directly to the stain prior to washing. Because they are dry-cleaning grade, they should work out the stains almost immediately, making your clothing look good-as-new.  ","try dish detergent. pour on some baby powder. rub some chalk on it. cover it up with cornstarch. pour on some talcum powder. make a salt and rubbing alcohol solution. use some dish soap. use a dry cleaning solvent.

"Find a pair of nitrile gloves (medical grade), goggles, and a mask for your safety.The batteries contain acid which can cause severe damage, so make sure you keep your face and hands covered. Once you have your safety equipment in place, move on to the next step.If you get any of the chemicals on your skin, clean it off with soap and water. Leaving the chemicals untreated can cause irritation.;  , Make sure to unhook the negative cable first, then follow with the positive cable. The negative cable is the black cable, and the positive is the red. You risk getting a shock if you touch the positive first. When putting the connection back on the terminals, connect in reverse order (positive then negative). Replace the cables and clamps to avoid future problems if damage is extensive.If you see any cracks or damage on the battery, do not touch the battery. You will need a professional to have the battery replaced.If the connections are too tight, try using WD-40 to loosen them., Check to see if there are any other issues with the battery during this process. If there are any other cracks or seepage, find a professional to replace the battery for you.  The scoop of baking soda should be one heaping scoop. Since baking is low in pH, it will help neutralize the acidity of the corrosion. Use hot water rather than cold to speed up the process.Avoid using household 'cleaners' like coke, coffee, or grease as they can run onto various parts of your engine. This may cause unnecessary corrosion on metal parts, soften rubber connections, and damage your asphalt or concrete driveway., You may also choose to pour on small amounts onto the cables. Gently brush around the connections, thoroughly getting around the base as well as cleaning the build up on the connections. Continue until the battery stops reacting to the baking soda mixture.Don't use a wire brush or reamers as they can potentially remove necessary materials. If you remove too much material, the clamp may not tighten as it should, and you will have loose connection., Ensure that all the materials and mixtures have been rinsed from the battery and connection. Avoid getting the mixture onto the battery compartment itself.  You may also put petroleum jelly or grease on the bases of the ports to prevent future corrosion., Connect the positive first then the negative. Use a wrench to tighten the connections sufficiently onto the ports. Place the red rubber boot over the positive terminal.

"Turn your oven on to 450 F (232 C) and let it preheat while you prepare the biscuits.Place about 2 tablespoons (30 g) of butter into a glass bowl. Place the bowl on top of the oven so the butter will warm and melt over the heat from the oven.  Use a glass or metal bowl for the butter, as this will conduct heat better and allow the butter to melt. Also, a plastic bowl might melt from the heat of the oven.  Melt the butter in the microwave or in a pot on the stove if your oven top doesn’t get hot enough to melt it.;  , Position a large sifter over a large mixing bowl. Measure the sugar, self-rising flour, and baking powder, and pour them into the large sifter. Tap the side of the sifter with your hand to sift the dry ingredients into the bowl. This will remove lumps and help incorporate the three ingredients.  To make your own self-rising flour, combine 5 cups (625 g) of all-purpose flour, 7½ teaspoons (30 g) of baking powder, and 1¼ teaspoons (7.5 g) of salt., Add the shortening to the bowl with the dry ingredients. With your fingers, rub the shortening into the flour. Continue mixing the ingredients together in this way until the dough takes on the texture of large crumbs.For a richer and flakier biscuit, you can use lard instead of vegetable shortening.  With your hand, make a well in the center of the dough. Pour the cold buttermilk and water into the well. Use a wooden spoon or rubber spatula to combine the wet and dry ingredients. Stop as soon as the dough starts to come together.  The biscuit dough will be sticky, but resist the urge to keep stirring. Overmixing will develop the gluten and make for dense and chewy biscuits., Turn the dough out onto a floured countertop or flat surface. Sprinkle some flour on top of the dough. Flatten the dough into a circle with your hands. Fold the left side of the dough into the center, and then the right side of the dough on top of that. Starting from the top, roll the dough into a pinwheel and shape it into a ball.  Flatten out the dough with your hands and repeat these same folding steps a second time.Folding the dough in this way will fully incorporate all the ingredients without overmixing the dough.  Avoid kneading, which can also develop the gluten.  Roll the dough out with the rolling pin. Continue rolling until you have a one-inch (2.5-cm) thick circle. Make sure the dough is an even thickness, otherwise your biscuits will be different sizes.  Add more flour to the rolling pin and counter to prevent sticking.  Use a floured 2-inch (5-cm) round cookie cutter to punch out as many biscuits as possible.When you can't get any more biscuits, collect the dough scraps. Shape them into a ball and roll out the leftover dough. Cut out as many biscuits as you can.  Repeat until there's no longer enough dough for more biscuits.  Transfer the biscuits to the baking sheet. Position them side by side so they're all just touching. Take your pastry brush and brush the tops of the biscuits with the melted butter that’s been warming on the oven.Brushing the tops with butter will add a bit of a salty kick to the biscuits, and help them become a nice golden brown when they bake.  Transfer the biscuits to the oven and bake them for 10 to 15 minutes. The biscuits are ready when they turn a light golden brown color. When they're done, remove them from the oven.  Set the baking sheet aside and let the biscuits cool for a few minutes.  When the biscuits are cool enough to handle, transfer them to a wire cooling rack. Set them aside until they're cool enough to eat, about 30 minutes.  Serve the biscuits plain, buttered, with jam or cream, or with cheese, meat, gravy, or any other topping you like.  Place a large frying pan over low heat and preheat the pan for about five minutes. Place the sausages in the pan and cook them over low heat. Use tongs to turn the sausages every two minutes. Cook the sausages for about 12 minutes, or until no pink remains and they're starting to brown.  When the sausages are done, remove the pan from the heat., With the tongs, take the sausages out of the pan and transfer them to a plate. Set them aside to cool. Leave the grease from the meat in the pan and return the pan to the stove.It’s important to use tongs instead of a fork to cook and move the sausages. A fork will pierce the meat and release the juices, making for drier sausage.  Add the butter to the frying pan with the sausage grease and heat it over medium heat. When the butter has melted, add the flour to the pan and whisk to combine it with the fat.  Cook the flour for about five minutes, whisking regularly, until it becomes smooth and golden brown., When the flour is smooth and golden, pour the milk into the pan, whisking as you pour to prevent lumps. Bring the gravy to a low boil, and then reduce the heat to medium-low. Continue simmering for 10 to 12 minutes, until the gravy thickens.Add milk by the tablespoon (15 ml) to the pan if the gravy becomes too thick, or until the desired consistency is achieved.  Use your fingers to break up each sausage into small chunks. Sprinkle the sausage pieces into the gravy and stir to combine. Taste the gravy and add salt and pepper if necessary.Once the sausages have warmed, remove the pan from the heat.  Place one or two warm biscuits on a serving plate. Spoon or ladle about a ¼ cup (59 ml) of hot gravy over each biscuit and enjoy!Avoid pouring the gravy on the biscuits until you're ready to serve them, as the gravy can make the biscuits soggy.  Biscuits can be cut in half, stuffed with various ingredients, and served like sandwiches. These are a popular item on the Hardee’s breakfast menu. A couple of the popular biscuit sandwiches are the plain meat ones, which are served with:  A chicken filet  A smoked sausage  A few slices of country ham  , Another popular breakfast sandwich is the egg, meat, and cheese combination. This usually consists of the biscuit with a layer of meat, followed by a cooked egg and topped with cheese. You can use a variety of meats for this sandwich, including:  Bacon  Steak or chicken fried steak  Sausage  , A monster sandwich at Hardee’s consists of fresh biscuits, ham, cheese, sausage, egg, and bacon. To assemble the sandwich:  Cut the biscuit in half  Place one to two slices of ham on the bottom half of the bun  Place a slice of cheese on top of the ham  Place a cooked sausage patty on top of the cheese, followed by another piece of cheese  Place a cooked egg on top of the cheese, followed by two to three pieces of bacon  Top the sandwich with the top of the biscuit and enjoy  ","preheat your oven and melt the butter. sift together the dry ingredients. rub in the shortening. add the buttermilk and water. fold the dough. roll the dough. cut the dough. brush the tops with butter. bake the biscuits. cool the biscuits before serving. cook the sausage. remove the cooked sausages from the pan. cook the flour in the butter and sausage grease. add milk and simmer. crumble in the sausage and season the gravy. ladle the gravy over fresh biscuits and serve. have a meat sandwich. make an egg sandwich. make a monster breakfast sandwich.

"A good way to prevent texting and driving is to turn your phone off. This helps you not hear any text or social media notifications, or see the screen light up when you get a text. If you don’t see any new messages, you won’t be tempted to look at them or respond.As soon as you stop, you can turn the phone back on. If you are on a long car ride, you can pull off the road every hour or so to check your messages if you need to check them.;  , If you don’t want to turn your phone off completely, turn it to silent. Even on silent you can see when you have a message. Just make sure you put the phone face down so you can’t see it light up with a new message and be tempted.If you want to leave your phone ringer on, you can silence your text message notifications.  If you want to keep your phone on, you can try to place it in a spot where you cannot reach it while driving. This helps keep your phone unavailable so you cannot be tempted to sneak a peak. Try placing it in the trunk, glove box, behind your seat, or in your console.If you do this, make sure you will not want to reach to these inconvenient places while driving. Trying to grab something out of reach can cause an accident.  To avoid a situation where you realize you need to send a very important text, take a moment before you start the car to send any texts you need to.

"Weight is defined as the force of gravity on an object. Scientists put that sentence into an equation by writing w = m x g, orw = mg.  Since weight is a force, scientists also write the equation as F = mg.  F = symbol for weight, measured in Newtons, N.  m = symbol for mass, measured in kilograms, or kg.  g = symbol for gravitational acceleration, expressed as m/s2, or meters per second squared.  If you're using meters, the gravitational acceleration at the earth's surface is 9.8 m/s2. This is the standard international unit, and the one you should probably be using.  If you're using feet because you have to, the gravitation acceleration is 32.2 f/s2. This is the same unit, it's just rearranged to reflect feet instead of meters.  Because we're trying to get weight from mass, we know we already have mass. Mass is the fundamental amount of matter an object has, and is expressed in kilograms.  In other words, figure out g. On the surface of the earth, g is 9.8 m/s2. Elsewhere in the universe, the acceleration of gravity changes. Your teacher should tell you, or the problem should indicate, where the gravity is acting from so that you know.  The gravitational acceleration on the moon is different from the gravitational acceleration on the earth. Acceleration due to gravity on the moon is about 1.622 m/s2, or about 1/6 of the acceleration that it is here on earth. That's why you weigh 1/6 of your earth-weight on the moon.  The gravitational acceleration on the sun is different from the gravitational acceleration on the earth and moon. Acceleration due to gravity on the sun is about 274.0 m/s2, or about 28 times the acceleration that it is here on earth. That's why you would weigh 28 times your earth-weight on the sun (if you could survive!).  Now that you've got m and g, you'll be able to plug those values into the equation F = mg and be ready to go. You should get a number described in terms of Newtons, or N.  Here's the question: 'An object has a mass of 100 kilograms. What is its weight on the surface of the earth?'  We have both m and g. m equals 100 kg, and g equals 9.8 m/s2, because we're looking for the weight of the object on the surface of the earth.  We set up our equation next: F = 100 kg x 9.8 m/s2.  This gives us the final answer. On the surface of the earth, an object with a mass of 100 kg will weigh approximately 980 Newtons. F = 980 N.  Here's the question: 'An object has a mass of 40 kilograms. What is its weight on the surface of the moon?'  We have both m and g. m equals 40 kg, and g equals 1.6 m/s2, because we're looking for the weight of the object on the surface of the moon this time.  We set up our equation next: F = 40 kg x 1.6 m/s2.  This gives us the final answer. On the surface of the moon, an object with a mass of 40 kg will weigh approximately 64 Newtons. F = 64 N.  Here's the question: 'An object weighs 549 Newtons on the surface of the earth. What is its mass?'  For this problem, we have to work backwards. We already have F and we have g. We just need m.  Let's set up our equation: 549 = m x 9.8 m/s2.  Instead of multiplying, we divide. Specifically, we divide F by g. An object weighing 549 Newtons on the surface of the earth will have a mass of about 56 kilograms. m = 56 kg.  The number one mistake people make on these problems is confusing mass and weight. Remember that mass is the amount of 'stuff' in an object, which stays the same no matter where you move it. Weight measures the force of gravity on that 'stuff,' which changes if you move through space. Here's are a couple mnemonic to keep your units distinct:  Mass is in units of grams or kilograms. Both mass and gram contain an m. Weight is in units of newtons. Both weight and newton contain a w.  You only have weight while you're 'wait'ing on Earth, but even 'mass'tronauts have mass.  Most physics problems use newtons (N) for weight, meters per second squared (m/s2) for gravitational force, and kilograms (kg) for mass. If you use a different unit for one of these values, you cannot use the same formula. Convert to scientific units before plugging them into the standard equation. These conversions may help you out if you're used to the imperial / U.S. system:  1 pound-force = ~4.448 newtons  1 foot = ~0.3048 meters  , If you're working on a complex problem, keep track of the units as you work through your solution. Remember that 1 newton is equivalent to 1 (kg*m)/s2. If necessary, make that substitution to help you cancel out units.  Example problem: Jeffrey weighs 880 newtons on Earth. What is his mass?  mass = (880 newtons)/(9.8 m/s2)  mass = 90 newtons/(m/s2)  mass = (90 kg*m/s2)/(m/s2)  Cancel units: mass = 90 kg  Kg is the expected unit for mass, so you arranged the problem correctly.  ","use the formula 'w = m x g' to convert weight into mass. figure out the mass of an object. figure out the gravitational acceleration. plug the numbers into the equation. solve sample question #1. solve sample question #2. solve sample question #3. avoid confusing mass and weight. use scientific units. expand newtons to check your units.

"It is worth spending some time considering placement, taking into account furnishings in the room, and the general environment and lighting. A good height for hanging pictures is often when your eye level is about a quarter of the way down the image, although this is a matter of taste.  If you have a friend or family member around, ask them to hold the painting against the wall for you so that you can see it from further away.  If you don't have anyone around to hold the painting for you, hold the painting against the all and mark where the corners of the painting are with pencil. You can then put the painting down and step back to look at the markings. Make any adjustments you see fit and repeat until you find where you would like the painting to be. Erase the pencil markings when you are done hanging your picture.;  , If you have trouble detecting where the center is by just looking at it, use a tape measure and make sure you make your mark halfway across the top of the picture. You do not need to draw a line along the entire top of the picture; simply mark along the very center of the picture.  Hook a tape measure on the hanging wire attached to the back of the picture. Pull the wire up towards the top of the picture so that it is taut. Measure the distance from the top of the picture to the hanging wire.  If your picture has a crossbar instead of a hanging wire, measure the distance from the crossbar to the top of the picture.  Measure the same distance down from the pencil mark you have made on the wall and mark this point with another pencil mark. This will be where you place your nail. When you make this measurement, try to keep the line as vertical as possible.  ","hold the picture you have selected against the wall. mark the wall along the top center of the picture with a pencil. put the picture face down on a flat surface. use this measurement (the distance from the hanging device to the top of the picture) to determine where you should place your nail or screw.

"A box grater is four sided, with each side having differently sized teeth.  Because box grates tend to have larger teeth, they work well with softer cheeses such as mozzarella or havarti.  Choose whichever grater plate suits the dish. The medium sized holes are great for garnishing tacos, but not so much for making crumb-like Parmesan to go on Spaghetti.  This will prevent you from scraping your fingers before you have the desired amount of shredded cheese.  This will make the cheese glide easier.  For box graters without a handle, hold the cheese and grater over a large bowl. For graters with a handle, place the end of the grater on a cutting board.  Once you reach the end of the cheese, rub it with your palm to avoid scraping your knuckles.  ","use a box grater to shred your cheese. keep your cheese medium to large sized. lightly coat the outside of the grater plate you will be using with cooking spray. let your box grate decide how you'll use it. rub the cheese against the grater in an up-and-down motion.

Allowing the tar to cool fully before you remove it can minimize the risk of damage to the skin underneath and ensure that it heals properly., Rub your skin that has on it with an ice cube or ice pack. Keep rubbing until the tar hardens or cracks. This can make it easier to peel away the tar from your skin and treat any damage or remove stains.If your skin gets too cold, remove the ice and let the tar sit for a few minutes. This can prevent ice burning or frostbite., Using gentle pulling motions, peel away any cooled tar from your skin. If the tar cracks, continue peeling away little pieces until you’ve removed each bit. Peeling away the tar may hurt or cause you discomfort from pulling out small hairs caught in the tar. If removing the tar becomes too painful, seek medical attention to minimize the risk of damage to your skin.Harden the tar with ice again if it softens from your body heat.  If you are able to remove the tar, cleanse your skin with a mild soap. Use a gentle, circular motion to spread the cleanser around the affected area. Then rinse your skin clean, warm water. This can remove tar fragments and residue. It can also get rid of any bacteria or germs that may cause infection on injured skin., Apply Neosporin ((polymyxin B sulfate-neomycin sulfate-gramicidin) or Tween 80 (polyoxyethylene 20 sorbitan mono-oleate) to your skin with tar on it. Allow it to work into the tar and your skin for a few minutes before gently wiping it away with a clean cloth or rinsing it off with warm water. This may be the most effect and safest way to remove tar. These two products break down tar, are virtually non-toxic, and may cause less pain and damage to your skin., Apply a thick layer of mayonnaise over the cooled tar. Let the mayonnaise work into your skin for at least 30 minutes. This allows the mayonnaise to break down the tar. Then, gently wipe away the mayonnaise and tar from your skin with a clean cloth or soft brush. Follow up by cleansing the affected skin to remove any residue, stains, or bacteria., Look through your pantry for different types of oil you eat or put on your skin.

"You may want to discuss hypnotherapy with your doctor before you seek treatment. Not all health professionals will be aware of or supportive of hypnotherapy as an alternative treatment. However, if your doctor is interested in the clinical effects of hypnosis, they may be able to help you obtain treatment.Your doctor may be able to refer you to a reputable therapist in your area that uses hypnotherapy.  Say to your doctor, 'I read about how many medical professionals are using hypnotherapy to treat IBS. What do you think about that?' or 'Doctors are using hypnotherapy to treat addictive disorders. I thought that might be a good fit for me. What are your thoughts?';  , There is no regulation for hypnosis. This means that not every person who is “certified” or offers hypnosis therapy can be trusted. The best way to ensure that you are getting proper treatment from a professional is to look for a licensed psychologist, therapist, psychiatrist, social worker, or other mental health professional who has training from reputable institution. Search for one who is interested in hypnotherapy.  Experts who use hypnotherapy may not be available in your area. You may need to search the internet or professional therapist associations to locate one near you.  Make sure the therapist has training in medicine or psychology. Ask if they are licensed in your state, and where they got their degrees, training, and licenses. Find out if they are members of professional organizations.  Discuss their experience with hypnotherapy and how long they have been performing it.Ask your doctor, hospital, or clinic for a referral to a hypnotherapist. Talk to any friends and family to see if they know about any hypnotherapists in your area. Search online to find therapists who specialize in hypnosis, and read any reviews about the therapist from others.  If you are having trouble finding hypnotherapists in your area, you may want to contact a professional organization. There are organizations dedicated to hypnotherapy where you can find information, studies, benefits, and practicing professionals.The American Society of Clinical Hypnosis and The International Medical & Dental Hypnotherapy Association have websites where you can find information about hypnotherapy. The American Psychological Association lists addresses, e-mail addresses, and phone numbers for various hypnosis organizations.  Only seek hypnotherapy if you are open to the idea or believe in its effectiveness. If you think hypnosis is stupid and won’t work, you will more than likely receive no benefits from it. To get to the hypnotic state, you have to allow yourself to sink into the deep state of relaxation.Some people are more susceptible than others. Those who are the least susceptible are people who are overly skeptical or resistant.  The therapist will start the session by helping you get to a relaxed, calm state where your mind is focused and open. They may talk to you in a calm, soothing voice as they vocally lead you to a place of relaxation. They may have you think of certain images to help promote relaxation.Part of getting into a total state of relaxation is feeling secure where you are. This is why it is very important for you to trust your therapist.  For example, your therapist may ask you to close your eyes while listening to calm music. They will count back from ten, asking you to relax your muscles more and more with each number. You will let the tension release from your body. Then, you may be asked to think of a serene lake and let your mind mirror that calm state.  One of the keys to hypnotherapy is using imagery in your mind. During hypnosis, you may be put into a relaxed, calm state where your mind is focused. You will visualize something, often a concrete image of your condition, and then work on changing that image in your mind from something negative to something positive.For example, if you suffer from chronic pain, you may be asked to visualize your pain. You may imagine that your pain is a large throbbing red ball. In a hypnotic state, you will be asked to think about your pain as something different, such as a less imposing, threatening thing. Your mind may reimagine the pain as a small pool of water or a small blue ball rolling slowly across the floor.  Another part of hypnosis is opening your mind in that focused, relaxed state to suggestions. These suggestions are given to you by a licensed professional. Before the hypnosis, you and your therapist will discuss your goals and what you want to be suggested while in your hypnotic state.You are always in control of what is being suggested to you. Hypnosis is not a form of mind control. This is one reason it’s important to find a hypnotherapist who is qualified and that you trust.  For example, while in a hypnotic state, your therapist may say, “You are not interested in cigarettes. You don’t want to pick up a cigarette. You do not have the urge to smoke.”  , Hypnosis may also provide the opportunity for you to figure out some of the underlying problems that may be stopping you from doing things or holding you back. In a hypnotic state, you may be able to revisit past events and experiences to understand yourself and habits better.Hypnosis can help you stop censoring yourself and instead open yourself to things you may usually ignore or push deeper into yourself.  For example, your therapist may ask you to go through your mind and find any memories that you may find uncomfortable in your normal state. You can calmly reflect on those memories and observe them in a safe way. When you get out of your hypnotic state, you and your therapist can discuss the memory and the impact it may have had on you.  Studies have shown that hypnotherapy can help achieve deeper, better sleep. You can listen to a hypnotic suggestion tape before bed to help calm and relax your mind, then fall asleep. Those who are susceptible to hypnosis may find that they sleep better after using hypnotherapy before bed.Hypnotherapy may be a technique for people who have trouble sleeping. This can be a way for them to fall asleep and get more rest.  Hypnosis has no side effects, unlike medication you take to sleep.  Hypnotherapy has been used with some patients who suffer from IBS. Studies conducted have shown that people with IBS had less symptoms and continued to see improvement for years after undergoing hypnotherapy. Patients were given hour long hypnotherapy sessions for 12 weeks.In hypnotherapy for IBS, you may be asked to visualize your intestine, which you see as a red inflamed tangle. In the hypnotic state, your therapist may suggest that you re-envision your intestine into something positive. You change your image to a pink, smooth rope, which helps your mind overcome symptoms.  Talk to your doctor about using hypnotherapy. If your doctor is skeptical, contact a therapist or hypnotherapist to discuss how hypnotherapy may help your IBS.  Hypnotherapy has been used to manage chronic pain associated with fibromyalgia, arthritis, and cancer. Hypnosis may also help with migraines.Hypnosis works towards helping you let go of negative emotions and stress that can sometimes be associated with chronic pain. It also helps you feel more empowered as you learn to take control away from the pain.Hypnosis helps refocus your attention away from the pain and instead puts you in control of your mind, where you lessen the importance of the pain.  Hypnotherapy is used to help with anxiety associated with medical procedures, like surgery and giving birth. Hypnosis is aimed to help reduce fear and pain in these situations. Psychologists are starting to use hypnotherapy in the treatment of anxiety disorders, depression, and phobias.Hypnotherapy may be helpful to help nervous habits, like biting your nails. Suggestions during the hypnotic state may help you overcome your phobias.  Hypnosis can be used to help with weight loss and overeating. Along with a weight management plan, hypnosis can help you change your attitude about weight loss, diet, and exercise. It can also help you learn how to manage your weight as you work towards your goals.Hypnosis can also help with self-esteem and body imagine.  Hypnosis may help you accept your body at each stage of your weight loss.  Hypnosis may be beneficial to children who suffer from certain nervous disorders. For example, hypnosis has been used to help with bed-wetting, stuttering, thumb sucking, phobias, sleepwalking, and even confidence issues. Children generally respond well to hypnosis.Hypnosis may help children uncover misunderstandings and understand what really was said or meant.  Hypnosis may be helpful in behavioral problems in children and teenagers.  Hypnosis is also used to treat other conditions. These conditions include habit disorders, like smoking, skin conditions, hemophilia, hot flashes nausea, and vomiting.

"When strengthening a friendship, self-disclosure is key to making it a deep friendship. It’s that vulnerability that allows you to get to know them, and for them to know you. Any lasting friendship with your best friend should include some of this. It’s okay to have boundaries, but being vulnerable deepens friendships.Let them know your struggles. You might say, 'I'm really struggling with my body image.' You might be surprised by what you both share.;  , They are always growing, as are you. And however similar the two of you are, it is important to remember that they are different from you. Supporting those differences is as important as reveling in the things you share. As you grow, the dynamics of the friendship may change. If you are open to those changes, you are well on your way to making the friendship last., Quality time is very important for maintaining a friendship. Whether it’s online or in person (or on the phone), it’s very important to check in with your best friend regularly. Whether you talk about your day, your work, or your love life, meaningful conversation on a regular basis between you two will strengthen the relationship., Trust is one of the most important aspects of any relationship. Trust is built on more than simply telling the truth. It is about being there when your friend needs you, keeping secrets, and respecting your friend’s identity., By sharing things you love, you will find new ways to interact with each other. And you will also deepen the friendship. Shared interests are key to lasting friendships. Sharing more important the interests is more likely to deepen the friendship. For instance, sharing similar world views will be more important than having the same taste in clothing or coffee., Whether it's a community ball game in which they are participating or a huge project at work, it's important to support your best friend in their accomplishments, as well as in their trials. Even good things, like winning a huge award, can be stressful. It's important to recognize that you both might not handle the situation the same. Listening to them during a crisis can be the most important thing.  One important way to support your best friend is through verbal affirmations. You might say, 'I'm so glad that you got the award,' or 'It's great that you are making the most of a bad situation.' Affirmations can also be simply letting them know you're there for them.

"Voltage is defined as the difference in charge between one point and another point and is measured in volts, designated “V.” It is often conceptualized by picturing a full tank of water and an empty tank connected by a hose. The full tank of water is at a high pressure, and the empty tank at a low pressure. The difference in water pressure is a similar concept to the difference in charge between the two terminals of a circuit., When there is a difference in charge between two points, you will have current. This is is the movement of charge from a point of high charge to a point of low charge and is measured in amperes, shown as “A.” A good analogy is that of a full tank of water attached to an empty tank by a hose. Water will flow from the full tank (high pressure) to the empty tank (low pressure), just as current moves from a point of high charge (source) to a point of low charge (ground)., Resistance is a property inherent of the material through which current is flowing. It is different for different materials, and is measured in Ohms, designated “ohms”. Resistance describes the degree to which the material inhibits current moving through it. High resistance will impede current more, and low resistance will impede the current less.  ","think of voltage as being similar to pressure. know that current is the flow of charge. consider how the material resists current. "
"You'll want to start with a clean canvas, so use a gentle cleanser to remove makeup and oils from your skin. Rinse with warm water, then pat (don't rub) your face dry with a towel. Avoid putting on moisturizer or sunscreen. These products might cause latex-based makeup to slide off.  Pull your hair back. If you have long hair or bangs, keep it out of your face while you work. Put it up into a ponytail, and clip stray hairs out of the way with bobby pins or a headband.  If you're a guy, you may want to shave before applying any make-up or prosthetic. Latex and gelatin can get stuck in the hair, making it them quite painful to remove.;  , Liquid latex and gelatin are two substances you can use to create really cool zombie effects - like open wounds, bloody gashes, bite marks and broken noses. Although they might sound intimidating or overly complicated to use, both liquid latex and gelatin are actually surprisingly easy to work with. An explanation of how both products work can be found in parts three and four of this article.  If you do decide to work with either liquid latex or gelatin, they will need to be applied at this point in the make-up process, that is, before you begin working with face paints.  However, if you decide these products are too much work or you don't have time to find them, just skip to the next step. You can still create a hideously decayed zombie look without them!  , Using a soft makeup or stippling sponge, dab the white all over your face. Then blend it in small, light motions until your whole face is covered in a thin layer of makeup. Allow it to dry completely.  Create a mottled effect by subtly applying a second color over the white. You can go with grey for an ashen, decayed effect, red or purple for a bruised effect or green and yellow for a gangrenous effect.  Use the best quality face paint you can find. Cheap, low-quality face paint will not blend well and is bad for your skin. Try to get your hands on some high-quality stage make up - it can usually be found in good costume stores.  Dark, sunken eyes can help you look dead, violently injured, sleep-deprived, or all of the above!  Outline your lids with dark pencil eyeliner, then smudge it outward. Then use black or brown eyeshadow or face paint to fill in the dark circles beneath the eyes and around the eyelids.  Blend around the edges with purple and red paint or shadow to create the illusion of freshly-bruised skin, or with green and yellow for an older looking bruise.  Zombies are often pretty emaciated looking - good brains can be hard to come by you know! You can achieve this sunken in effect by sucking in your cheeks and lightly blending some black powder or paint into the hollows. This will highlight your cheekbones.  Apply black lipstick or face paint to your lips for a dried-out, dead look. Also emphasize the creases around your mouth with some dark, shadowy lines.  Use a small paintbrush to paint thin, zig-zagged lines in blues and purples all over the face to create popping veins. Take a dry stippling sponge (or some other coarse sponge) and dip it in red face paint. Draw the sponge lightly over the skin to create a bloody-looking scratch.  You can buy fake blood at most costume stores, or you can make your own non-toxic version simply by adding some red food coloring to corn syrup. For all the fake blood you'll ever need, mix one cup of corn syrup with one or two tablespoons of red food coloring. For darker, more realistic looking, you can also add one or two drops of blue food coloring.  Apply the blood to your hairline and let it drip down your face, or cup some blood in your hand and dip your mouth in to make it look like you just fed!  Use a toothbrush for blood spatter. Put some fake blood onto a toothbrush, aim the bristles at your face, and run your finger over the bristles from bottom to top.  Create a dripping blood effect. Dip a sponge into the fake blood and squeeze it over your skin. The blood should run into a natural-looking drizzle.  Zombie contact lenses - which are typically very pale blue or white - can really up the scare-factor of your costume. Find such contact lenses online or at costume stores.  The undead aren't particularly concerned with personal hygiene, so washing their hair isn't a priority. If you want your locks to look limp and lifeless, rub a generous amount of conditioner through them. You can do this before or after you apply your makeup.  You can also make your hair look messy and unkempt (for that 'just out-of-the-coffin' look) by teasing or backcombing the hair using a small comb. Spritz with hairspray to hold in place.  Sprinkle baby powder into your roots to achieve a graying, ashen effect.  Like the rest of their bodies, zombies' teeth are typically rotting and decayed. Of course, it's possible to buy fake teeth at the costume store, but these can be awkward or uncomfortable to wear and prevent you from talking or eating properly. Overcome this problem by (temporarily) staining your teeth using water mixed with a little brown food coloring.  Swish the the mixture around your mouth and between your teeth, then spit out. Alternatively, you could use red food coloring for a bloody effect!  When you're done, brush your teeth with a little baking soda to remove the stains and restore your teeth to their original color.  Perfect zombie make-up should be complemented by an authentic-looking zombie costume. To create a classic zombie costume, get some old dress clothes (second-hand stores are great for this) and do whatever you can to rip and dirty them. Go at them with a scissors, roll them in the mud, give them to the dog to chew on - the scruffier they end up looking, the better.  Create bullet holes in your clothing by making circular marks with black permanent marker, then dribble or splatter fake blood around the edges.  The great thing about zombie make-up is that you can wear it with any costume to instantly zombify it. Use your creativity to come up with a zombie version of whatever boring Halloween costume you were originally thinking of -- become a zombie ballerina, a zombie tourist or a zombie pirate!  , Liquid latex is good for achieving a generally deathly look, as well as building up wounds or other facial deformities.  You should be able to find it at seasonal Halloween supply stores, or at beauty supply chains.  Choose a color that looks appropriately pale and decaying.  Stretching out your skin as you apply latex ensures that you won't have any accidental blank patches. Additionally, it will leave you with some decidedly creepy wrinkling when the latex dries.  Gently spread or stretch the area of skin you're painting. It's best to do this technique one area at a time (i.e., forehead, one cheek, chin, etc.).  Using a clean paintbrush or makeup sponge, apply a thin layer of liquid latex to the area in small stippling motions. Keep your strokes light and short.  You can use these techniques to make the face look misshapen, or lay the groundwork for a scabbing 'wound.'  Apply another layer of latex to 'build' your make up. Creating light layers of latex, instead of smearing on thick amounts, creates even coverage with minimal clumping.  Mix a little bit of uncooked oatmeal with the latex, then apply in one or two small areas on the face. This is great for a gangrenous or scabby look.  Put single-ply tissue between latex layers. Get a piece of toilet paper, and separate the sheets so that you have a single ply. Rip the edges until you have the shape and size you want. Hold it over an area with a base latex layer already underneath it, and paint another layer over it. It will help disguise the smoothness of your skin with a rotting texture.  By selectively ripping parts of the liquid latex, you can put wide gashes or small lacerations into your new skin.  Use scissors. You should carefully snip the latex until you create the wound you want. Be careful not to nick your skin!  Use a toothpick. Simply stick it into the liquid latex and drag it through for a gaping wound.  Dip a clean paintbrush or makeup sponge into fake blood, and gently dab it into your gashes or over your oatmeal portions.  For the right consistency, use about 1/3 cup (80mL) of water per packet of gelatin.  Color the gelatin. Use a few drops of food coloring for an unnatural tone, or add a bit of liquid foundation in a tone close to your skin for a flesh-like look.  Cut the gelatin into cubes. Store it in a bowl or resealable plastic bag.  If you heat it to boiling, you'll break down the structure of the gelatin. Put it in a bowl in the microwave and heat in 10-second intervals, until the cubes have softened and become slightly gooey.  Using a popsicle stick or tongue depressor, glop the gelatin onto the area. As it begins to dry and re-harden, use the stick to pull up small, stretchy threads — this will create more texture around the wound.  If you're still using a makeup sponge on other parts of your face, be careful to steer clear of the gelatin areas.  ","prepare your face. apply latex or gelatin to create wounds and gashes (optional). apply a base of white face paint or stage make-up. create dark circles around your eyes. hollow out your cheeks. darken your lips. create popping veins and bloody scratches. finish with some fake blood. wear creepy zombie contact lenses. get greasy zombie hair. stain your teeth. create the costume. purchase liquid latex. use the 'stretch and stipple' technique. build up deformities or wound sites. put wounds or scabs into latex. fill your wounds with blood. make gelatin a few hours before. gently heat the gelatin. apply the gelatin to your face to create raised wounds. allow the gelatin to harden and dry.

"Shampoo certainly removes grease, but it can strip away too much of your hair's protective oil, leaving your hair dry and vulnerable to damage. If you hair breaks easily or quickly develops split ends, you may already be shampooing too often. Find a washing schedule that leaves your hair healthy and soft, so you can address the greasiness without destroying your hair.  You might be able to wash daily if you have very fine hair, live in a humid area, or exercise daily to the point of heavy sweating. For most people, washing once every 2–4 days is recommended. You may need to wash even less often if you have extra-curly African hair, or if you've treated your hair with keratin.Your hair will produce oil at the same rate, no matter how often you shampoo.;  , Find a shampoo intended for oily or greasy hair. The most effective examples tend to include sulfates, which are infamous in some circles for the damage they can cause to skin and hair.Give it a try, but switch to a sulfate-free product if the shampoo irritates your skin or swings your hair too far in the dry, damaged direction.  If you can't find an effective, safe shampoo, you might be able to replace shampoo entirely with one of the home remedies below.  Avoid products that advertise 'added shine,' which is caused by oily ingredients.  Dry shampoo is a scented powder that sits in your hair and absorbs grease, without rinsing away all your protective oils. Hold the can at least 6 inches (15 cm) away from your hair, and spray lightly onto the roots and mid-shafts in oily areas. Let sit for two minutes, then massage it into your hair with clean hands. Apply whenever your hair feels greasy, about 1–3 times between washes.Too much dry shampoo can cause white buildup. Apply lightly and to oily areas only (typically the layers of hair nearest to your scalp).  Dry shampoo is available in powder form as well as sprays. Choose this if you are sensitive to fragrance or aerosols.  Baking soda, talcum powder and other powders are also effective for absorbing grease.  Conditioner is designed to make your hair soft and silky, which is a short step from greasy. Only use it immediately after shampooing, when your hair is at its driest, and stick to a dollop the size of a small coin. Rub it into the ends of your hair only, as your roots are slick enough on their own.  To reduce the amount of conditioner even further, lightly apply a spray-on, leave-in conditioner instead.Surprisingly, a co-wash (using conditioner instead of shampoo) does actually remove some oil, though not as much as shampoo.However, co-washing is mainly beneficial for dry hair. Shampoo is a safer bet for someone with grease issues.  Unsurprisingly, hair grease and its gel and mousse cousins won't do you any favors in the fight against oil. Stick to light products only, such as texturizing sprays. If you bust out the mousse for a special occasion, be sure to wash it out at the end of the day.  Clarifying shampoos are extra-powerful products that strip out buildup from hair products. Because these are harsh enough to damage hair, use this once every 2nd to 4th wash.Never use clarifying shampoo on color treated hair, which will likely fade and may be vulnerable to damage.  Many people with dandruff often think the problem is dry skin. Actually, dandruff can be triggered by an overproduction of sebum, or scalp oil.If you have dandruff, treat it with dandruff shampoo according to label instructions.  There are several types of dandruff shampoo. If your dandruff doesn't decrease after a few uses, switch to one with a different active ingredient, or visit your doctor for a prescription-strength treatment.  ","decide on a shampoo schedule. choose your shampoo. embrace dry shampoo. apply conditioner with caution. reduce use of hair products. resort to clarifying shampoo if necessary. treat dandruff. "
"You can play hide and seek with multiple people and multiple dogs if you want, or you can play it alone with just your chihuahua. First, tell your chihuahua to stay in one place (he’ll need to know this command) and then go hide somewhere in your house. Once you’re hiding, call your chihuahua’s name so he’ll come find you.You may need to say your chihuahua’s name a couple of times if he isn’t use to the game yet.  If your chihuahua doesn’t know the stay command, or isn’t good at it, you might need another person to hold him in one spot while you hide. Once your hidden, that person can let him go and he’ll come find you.  Make sure you only hide in place where your chihuahua can get to or is allowed.;  , If your chihuahua has a lot of toys, chances are they end up all over the house throughout the day. A great game to play with your chihuahua at the end of each day is to have him fetch his toys and put them away in the toy box.Such a game will require some training in order for your chihuahua to learn certain commands.  For example, you may want to use the command “clean-up” to indicate your chihuahua needs to find all the toys and bring them to you.  Another example is to teach your chihuahua a command, like “in the basket” to tell your chihuahua he needs to place each toy in the toy box.  Either using a rope (there are rope toys of all sizes specifically made for dogs) or another favourite toy, play tug-o-war with your chihuahua. Basically you want to grab the toy at the same time as your chihuahua and not let go. Your chihuahua will then tug on the toy to try to get it away from you.If you have more than one chihuahua, you might even be able to teach them to play tug-o-war with each other. Or they might just figure it out themselves when they both want to play with the same toy at the same time!  , Fetch is a game that comes naturally to some dogs due to their instincts; chihuahuas are one of those breeds. When you throw a toy for your chihuahua, he may instinctively go get that toy and bring it back to you. If he does this, use the word “fetch” while he’s bringing the toy back so he begins to associate the command with the action he’s performing. Eventually he’ll understand that when you throw a toy and say “fetch,” he’s suppose to bring the toy to you.While in training, your chihuahua may not always bring the toy back to you when you throw it. If he doesn’t bring it back to you, and instead you have to go get it, remember not to say the command “fetch.'

"Keeping a journal can be beneficial for understanding how your environment affects your mood, energy, health, sleep and so on. Journaling can also help you process your emotions and gain insight into why certain things make you feel a certain way., Even if you write only for a few minutes, it can be helpful to jot down your feelings and thoughts.  Make it easy for yourself to write when the mood strikes. Consider using a simple note-taking application on your phone or tablet computer.  Don’t feel like you need to write complete sentences if it’s easier for you to write phrases or bullet points. Don’t worry about spelling, grammar or style. Just write to get your thoughts out on paper.  If you require more structure, you can seek out people who teach journaling; you can read books about journaling; or you can use websites to keep online journals.  Use your journal however you want.

"A bicep curl is the standard bicep workout done with hand weights. Doing an alternating curl means you switch back and forth between your arms so that you get an even workout.  Stand with your feet apart and flat on the ground. Hold a dumbbell in each hand and let each hand hang down at your side with your palms facing forward. As you curl up, your palms should be facing your shoulder.  Raise your right dumbbell so that it reaches shoulder height by curling your forearm up towards your chest. The underside of your forearm should face up towards the sky.  While lowering the right dumbbell, begin to lift the left one up in the same manner. Avoid jerking your body backwards to help you lift the dumbbells. If you are doing this, your dumbbells are too heavy.  A hammer grab is another way to work out your biceps. This gets its name from the way you hold the dumbbell like the handle of a hammer.  Grab a dumbbell in each of your hands so that your palms face in towards your body. Hold your arms down by your sides.  Curl your arms and lift the dumbbells so that the tops of the dumbbells comes toward your shoulders. The inner side of your forearm should be facing to the side.  Seated arm exercises can be great to do while watching TV. This is called an isolated exercise because it only works one of your muscle groups.  Sit on the edge of a chair or bench. Hold one dumbbell in your right and let your arm hang down so that your right elbow rests against the inside of your right thigh.  Raise the dumbbell until it almost reaches shoulder height. It should not actually reach your shoulder or else the bicep will disengage. Hold it there for a pause of 5 to 10 seconds and then slowly lower it back to towards the ground.  Repeat these steps with the other your other arm.  ","do an alternating bicep curl. do a hammer curl. do a seated isolated dumbbell curl. "

"The exact gauge for this project does not matter.  This demonstration uses a two ounce ball of four-ply, worsted weight yarn and an H/8 or 5.0mm hook. The result is a ball about 5' in diameter.  The diameter increases more slowly, the more you crochet. Be prepared to use at least one full ball of yarn.;  ,,,  The exact number of stitches does not matter much. You may start this project with any start you usually use to crochet in the round, and with any number of stitches that seems comfortable.  Don't worry if the first ring or two doesn't look like much.  Go ahead and join rounds. There's no need to count stitches in this pattern.  The circumference doubles with each subsequent row, because you are crocheting two stitches per stitch. As the circle gets bigger, the circumference gets much bigger.  Add as many rows and as much yarn as you wish. Each subsequent row will take twice as long to crochet, but it will also make the puff curlier.  The puff will become progressively more curly, the longer you crochet. It could go further still, but it will require more and more yarn.

"Many scenes have several 'layers' of sounds and music, from ambient sounds that might actually be heard at that location, such as traffic or birds, to sounds that are inserted to help create a mood. Many scenes also include music that helps to tell the story.  Keep in mind that the director may have deliberately taken out any true ambient sounds and inserted others. Imagine what you might actually hear at the scene's location and whether the director made a good choice in the sounds he or she included.  Take note if the director inserted sounds to evoke a particular emotion from the audience. For instance, a beat or ticking clock creates a sense of urgency or dread.  Listen to the music and ask yourself what it represents and whether it tells you what to expect. For example, a composer might create a particular melody that you will hear whenever a character is thinking about his lost love.  Determine whether the movie contains original music or music the director has licensed from another artist. Ask yourself why the director chose one or the other (or both).  Close your eyes and listen to music. Try to guess what is happening by what you hear.  ","close your eyes and concentrate on what you hear during the scene. note whether the scene is narrated and determine why the director included narration. "
"It is usually shelved alongside other garden fertilizers. Fortunately, vermiculite is relatively cheap; you'll be able to purchase a 1kg bag for under $10.Medium grade vermiculite is the standard choice for gardening.Because vermiculite isn't a particularly popular material to use with gardening, there's a chance a more general store won't keep it in stock. When in doubt, check a gardening outlet for supplies. Looking up stores online will give you an idea of a store's stock without having to physically visit it.;  , Clay-based soils will become soggy with the addition of vermiculite. Although this isn't necessary for soil that already gets adequate rainfall, vermiculite will help maximize the moisture your container receives if it needs that extra push.  Although you should still regularly water a gardening container manually, vermiculite is good if your climate is hot and doesn't get much rain on its own.Peat, perlite and manures are alternatives that may better suit your gardening situation if you're looking for a more general fertilizer.  Take four 2x6 wooden boards and nail them together to create a four foot square box. This amount of space should be enough to grow the majority of container plants.  Saw down the boards first to make sure they're smooth-edged and are the same width and length before you nail them together.  Two nails (on near the top and one near the bottom) should be enough to firmly secure one board to another.  Something simple and biodegradable like cardboard or newspaper is a perfect foundation. From there, you can fill up your container with plant-appropriate soil.  Landscape fabric is another alternative for this purpose.  Open up your vermiculite bag and drain the contents into the soil you have prepared for the container. When this is finished, you can add the soil mix to the container.  It helps to measure out the soil into your container beforehand. That way, you can add vermiculite until it reaches the 20-25% goal.  Add vermiculite with soil or moss peat. Peat is another well-known fertilizer. You can increase the fertilization by combining vermiculite as such. Vermiculite may also be used on its own.  Because a container is relatively small you'll want to make the most of the entire soil area. You can do this by spreading the vermiculite throughout the pot with a spade. You may add vermiculite to the soil before adding it to the container. This way, you can mix it together without worrying about damaging the plants.  If you've properly measured out how much soil needs to go into the container, having that amount in a bag and adding the vermiculite to the bag will allow you to shake it up, thereby distributing it without having to proportion it out yourself.  If you're transferring a plant, lift it out gently from its original pot and place it in the desired spot in the container. If you're seeding the container from scratch, add seeds and bury them just beneath the soil's surface.  The seeds should be buried just beneath the surface. Don't put them too far into the soil or they'll have a hard time germinating.  Be careful not to damage the roots of your plant if you transfer them into the container. Dig a small hole for it beforehand, and gently place it in. It may be helpful to place some fresh vermiculite around the plant to account for the dry soil the new plant brought in with it.  In addition, vermiculite helps fend against weeds, although you shouldn't have a problem with them in a closed container environment.  Watering plants is a vital part of gardening. This is especially true if you're gardening with a container, as you'll need to take that much more control of the growth process. Due to the high level of water retention in vermiculite, you should take care not to overwater your plants. Give your container a shower dispersed evenly throughout the area, but don't allow pools of water to form on the soil's surface.  Turn the container slightly on its side and let out the excess water.  Alternatively, you can allow the water to drain out naturally., Add 20-25% of the compost's volume worth of vermiculite and mix them together thoroughly.  Although the main source of contamination (a mine accident at the Libby Mine in Montana) is no longer being sold, there's still some stigma due to the association.  If you are concerned about this, you can have a sample of your vermiculite sent to a lab for testing.Asbestos is a material used to insulate buildings. It is poisonous to humans.  Because vermiculite picks up asbestos so easily, you shouldn't store it in an attic, or other places where there's a lot of insulation.  Putting it in a shed should be fine, so long as the area is free of moisture.  In the case where you think asbestos may have tainted your vermiculite, don't hesitate to reach out to a professional. A professional well-versed in insulation and asbestos should help out your situation.If you notice something acting up in the vermiculite or negative signs to your personal health, you should see a doctor immediately.  Shortness of breath, coughing and chest pain are all signs of asbestos contamination.  ","purchase vermiculite.on your next trip to a home improvement store, ask a sales representative to direct you to the vermiculite stock. ensure vermiculite works for you.vermiculite is a solid choice for gardening in containers because of its high level of water retention. prepare a container.growing plants in a container will allow you to better control the growth conditions. make a foundation using newspaper or cardboard.giving your box a floor will limit the plant's roots from encroaching beyond the container while it's growing. pour vermiculite from the bag into soil.20-25% vermiculite will have a major effect on a soil plot's ability to retain water and promote plant growth. spread the vermiculite evenly. seed, or transfer plants into your container.after you have aerated the soil, add your seeds or plants to the container. cover small seeds.covering smaller seeds with an added bit of vermiculite will help lend them some much-needed moisture during the early growing stages. water your container. pour out excess water.because vermiculite retains water so well, you don't have to have too much water in your container. improve an existing compost.in addition to a container garden, you can add vermiculite to existing compost in order to further aerate it. acknowledge vermiculite's association with asbestos.because vermiculite is sometimes associated with asbestos, you should keep asbestos risk in mind whenever handling it. avoid the attic for storage.asbestos is commonly used in insulation with housing. call an expert if there's trouble.

"A percent solution simply means parts per hundred. In terms of making a chemical solution this means that you will have 1 gram of compound for every 100 milliliters of liquid or 1 mL/100mL if you are working with an already liquid compound.For example by weight: A 10% solution by weight simply means that you have 10 grams of compound dissolved in 100 mL of solution.  For example by volume: A 23% solution by volume simply means that you have 23 mL of liquid compound in every 100 mL of solution.;  , In order to determine the mass of the compound needed, you must first determine the final volume of the solution you want to make. The volume will be determined by how much solution you need for your task, how frequently you will need it, and the stability of the solution over time.  Make only the amount you need if the solution must be made fresh every time it is used.  If the solution is stable long-term, you can make a larger volume to store and use later.  For example: Make a 5% solution of NaCl in 500 mL of water.  To calculate the number of grams needed to make your percent solution, you will multiply using the formula: # grams = (percent desired)(desired volume/100 mLs). The percent desired will be expressed in grams and the desired volume must be expressed in milliliters.For example: Make a 5% solution of NaCl in 500 mL of water.  # grams = (5g)(500mL/100mL) = 25 grams  If the NaCl was already dissolved in liquid form, you would add 25 mL of NaCl instead of grams of powder and subtract that volume from the final volume: 25 mL of NaCl into 475 mL of water.  Once you have calculated the desired mass, you need to weigh it out. Using a calibrated balance, place a weighing dish and zero it out. Weigh out the necessary amount of compound in grams and set it aside.  Always clean the balance of any powder before continuing to make the solution.  For example: Weigh out 25 g of NaCl.  Unless otherwise stated, you will probably be diluting the compound in water. Using a graduated cylinder (a measuring device used specifically for volume), measure out the desired amount of liquid. Mix with powdered compound until dissolved.Clearly label the container with both the chemical and the concentration.  For example: Mix 500 mL of water and 25 g of NaCl to make a 5% solution.  Remember, if you’re diluting a liquid compound, you must subtract out the volume of liquid being added from the final volume: 500 mL – 25 mL = 475 mL of water.

"The easiest way to do this is get some software that will format what you type into it appropriately (for example Celtx).  At the beginning of every scene write where it is, and whether you are indoors or outdoors (Int. = Indoors Ext. = Outdoors). Stage directions are written in blocks of text spanning from the margin on the left to the margin on the right. Text is in blocks at the middle spanning from the centre (imagine the page is split into three equal thirds, you would be writing text in the center). Always have characters' names in capitals except within dialogue.;  , Look at where they come from. The show's nation usually dictates the comedy used. For example, American comedy is mainly slapstick and what happens to the characters, whereas British comedy is more about what the characters do to each other and fooling the audience. Of course, there are many other styles, so just look around and find an amusing balance.  You can have sci-fi, adventure, or something as simple as the misadventures of two friends (also known as slice-of-life).  Get a notebook and dedicate a page to a character. Explain how they act and behave, how they talk, and most importantly, why. The characters are the basis of your story.  You will want about 15 to 20 plot points, and this may sound daft, but make sure they are in chronological order. You don't want to write any jokes here as this comes with the script.  Get your laptop, computer, book, anything! Just start writing. Use the format if you're planning on selling this. Type in Courier New, size 12, since this is the industry standard. This is where you put the jokes in. Make them true to your character and to your style. You want to write about 25 pages (the general rule of thumb is one minute per page).  Look for character consistency and plot holes. Once you have read that, revise it into the second draft. Always save every draft as a different file. This is so that you can read them all through, and if you think the humour starts to slip somewhere, go back to where it started to slip and revise!  , However, you'll want about 5 scripts, at least at first. Do not let anyone but critics and friends see them. This is to build up a small portfolio and avoid plagiarism.  Search for some agencies and try to get an agent.

"Ideally, you should begin preheating the oven before poaching the tuna, boiling the pasta, or preparing the sauce. Doing so will ensure that the oven is ready for the tuna pasta bake by the time your other ingredients are finished.;  , Fill a medium stockpot halfway with water, then set the pan on the stove over medium-high heat. Allow the water to reach a simmer.  Once bubbles and steam begin to appear, you can continue to the next step. You do not need to wait for the water to reach a full boil.  Note that the poaching step is only necessary if you decide to work with fresh tuna steaks. If you use canned tuna, simply open the cans, drain the water or oil, and set the tuna aside until needed.  Place the tuna steaks, lemon half, and thyme in the simmering water. Reduce the heat to medium or medium-low, keeping the water at a gentle simmer.  You can cook the tuna without the addition of lemon and thyme, but these seasonings will give the tuna more flavor and add more dimension to the finished tuna noodle bake.  Cook the tuna, uncovered, at a gentle simmer for about 10 minutes or until it flakes easily with a fork.When the tuna is ready, remove it from the water and gently flake it apart with two forks. Set the flaked tuna aside until later. Discard the water, lemon, and thyme.  Fill a separate saucepan with roughly 4 qt (4 L) of cold water. Set the pan on the stove over medium-high heat, and bring the water to a boil.  If desired, you can add a little salt to the water after it reaches a boil, but doing so is not strictly necessary.  Add the pasta to the boiling water and cook it for 2 minutes less than the recommended time marked on the box.  Since the pasta will continue to cook while the dish bakes, you should not boil it to completion during this step.  You can use nearly any type of short pasta for this recipe, but cooking times will vary depending on the type you choose. While you should always follow the package guidelines, the following cook times are typically accurate:Egg noodles, regular: 8 minutes  Egg noodles, extra-wide: 10 minutes  Elbow macaroni: 8 minutes  Farfalle: 13 minutes  Penne: 9 minutes  Rigatoni: 12 minutes  Rotini: 8 minutes  Shells, medium: 9 minutes  Wagon wheels: 10 minutes  Ziti: 14 minutes  , When the pasta is ready, drain the water. Set the pasta aside, keeping it warm until the recipe calls for it again.  Place the butter in a medium saucepan. Set the pan on the stove over medium-high heat, and melt the butter completely.  As the butter melts, tilt the pan so that it evenly coats the entire bottom.  Toss the chopped onions into the melted butter. Cook the onions, stirring frequently, for about 5 minutes.  When ready, the onions should be wilted, translucent, and more fragrant.  Sprinkle the flour over the butter and onion mixture. Whisk the flour into the mixture until it soaks up all the butter and becomes thoroughly moist.  Continue cooking the flour for an additional 1 minute, whisking constantly. This additional cook time is necessary to destroy the bitter taste of raw flour.  Slowly pour the milk into the pan, whisking it into the roux (the butter and flour mixture) as you add it.After adding all the milk, reduce the heat to medium and continue cooking the sauce mixture for another 4 minutes or so, whisking continuously. When ready, the sauce should be notably thick.  Remove the saucepan from the heat. Sprinkle the salt and black pepper into the sauce, then grate three-quarters of the cheddar cheese directly into the sauce.  Mix well to combine. The residual heat of the sauce should melt most of the cheese.  Cover the saucepan and keep the sauce warm until you're ready to use it again. Ideally, the sauce should be the last component you prepare before putting the entire bake together.  Thoroughly and evenly stir together the prepared tuna, pasta, sauce, and vegetables in a large bowl. Immediately pour the combined ingredients into the prepared baking dish.  The mixture will be thick, so you should use the back of the mixing spoon to spread it evenly into the pan.  In a small bowl, mix together the unseasoned bread crumbs and the olive oil. Continue stirring until the crumbs have completely soaked up the oil.  Grate the remaining cheddar cheese over the top of the tuna bake, then sprinkle the freshly chopped parsley over it. Cover everything with the moistened bread crumbs.  Leave the baking dish uncovered. The cheese and breadcrumbs need to be exposed to the direct heat of the oven.  Place the filled baking dish in the preheated oven. Cook the tuna pasta bake for approximately 25 minutes, or until the top turns golden brown and the edges begin to bubble.  To prevent the bake from burning, check through the window of the oven door every 5 minutes or so, starting at the 20-minute mark. It might be done in as few as 20 minutes or as many as 35 minutes.  Remove the tuna pasta bake from the oven and let it rest for roughly 5 minutes. Serve the dish while it's still hot.

"Many people love cropped jeans that come up to the waist, as tucking your shirt in calls attention to your figure. However, you do not necessarily have to tuck in your shirt. Cropped jeans can also work with large sweaters or tunics that do not require tucking in. This can work great in a casual setting.If you want to highlight your waist without looking too formal, tuck your shirt in halfway.  Cropped jeans can still work in the colder months with some layering. This can also help with proportions. If you, say, tuck in your shirt with your jeans, you can also pair it with a longer jacket or blazer. This will draw attention to your legs and shoes. When layering, opt for a shorter shirt paired with a longer cardigan, blazer, or jacket., Most types of shoes work well with cropped jeans.

"High cholesterol, high blood sugar, and high blood pressure may not cause symptoms until cardiovascular disease has become severe and resulted in organ damage. For this reason, it is important to schedule annual visits, or physicals, with your doctor to assess your risk of heart disease. You doctor can measure your blood pressure and order blood tests to look at cholesterol levels.  If any of these measurements are abnormal, she may prescribe medication that could be crucial for preventing a heart attack.  You should start cholesterol screening no later than age 45., Medication that help with blood clots are called antiplatelet agents. Platelets are a component of the blood that are triggered to form blood clots when there is injury. Aspirin is the most commonly used medication in this group. It is a pill generally taken once a day in a dose of 81 to 325 mg. Side effects for regular use include stomach upset and, in rare cases, GI bleeding.  Other types of antiplatelet agents include Plavix, Brilinta, and Effient. These are also pills that are generally taken once daily. The common side effect of taking these is easy bleeding and bruising., Cholesterol medications are called statins. They work by lowering bad cholesterol in your system and raising good cholesterol. This prevents the development of plaque in the heart. There are a number of different types, including Lipitor, Pravachol, Crestor, Mevacor, Altoprev, Zocor, and Livalo. These are pills that are generally taken once daily.  In general, this class of medication is very safe and has very few and infrequent side-effects. Studies have suggested that they can rarely cause minor injury to the liver and kidneys. They can also cause muscle toxicity, injury and breakdown. Statin therapy plays an especially important role in reducing cardiovascular risk in diabetic patients.  Frequently, lifestyle changes are not enough to reduce blood pressure to healthy levels and prescription medications must be used. Thiazide diuretics reduce fluid volume and cause relaxation of vessels in your heart. This medication is taken once daily. Side effects include low potassium, which can cause muscle weakness and irregular heartbeat, as well as low sodium, which can cause dizziness, vomiting, and fatigue.The most effective regimen for lowering blood pressure is a combination of both lifestyle changes and medication. Sometimes more than one type of medication is necessary.  ACE inhibitors stop a hormone called Angiotensin II, which results in narrowed vessels and increased fluid retention in the heart. It is generally taken one to three times daily. Major side effects include low blood pressure, which can cause dizziness and fainting, elevated potassium, and cough.  Up to 20% of patients taking an ACE inhibitor will develop a dry, hacking cough, generally within one to two weeks of starting the medication., There are three other types of medications that are classified as blockers. Beta blockers, alpha blockers, and calcium channel blockers. Alpha and beta blockers may be used if you do not respond to other medications. These work by blocking signals from nerves and hormones in the body that cause narrowed blood vessels. They are taken one to three times daily.  Side effects for beta blockers include cough and shortness of breath, low blood sugar, high potassium, depression, fatigue, and sexual dysfunction. Side effects for alpha blockers include headache, nausea, weakness, and weight gain.Also try calcium channel blockers. Calcium channel blockers are potent vasodilators, which work by relaxing the muscle in the wall of vessels. These are generally taken one to three times daily. Side effects include swelling in the lower extremities and decreased heart rate.  ","visit your doctor to get assessed. take medicine for blood blots. get cholesterol medication. ask your doctor about thiazide diuretics. try angiotensin-converting enzyme (ace) inhibitors. use blockers.

"The two screws labeled 'L' and 'H' are used to adjust your limits. Basically, they determine how far in either direction the chain can travel. Unless you're having issues with the chain falling out, there is no reason to adjust these screws on the rear derailleur (as they were likely set properly at the factory). However, if your bike was in an accident or you installed a new derailleur, these screws may need to be adjusted.  If you keep slipping a chain, check your limit screws.  If you can't shift into the highest or lowest gear, check limit screws.  If your chain is grinding against your frame, check limit screws., Of course, you would turn it counter-clockwise if the chain is getting stopped too early. The high limit is for the smallest gear in the rear derailleur., Again, turn it the opposite way (counter-clockwise) if the limit is pushed too far in. On the rear derailleur, the low limit is for the biggest gear., Once you've got the limits where you want them, make sure they are lined up nicely. You should see the jockey wheel (metal arm with small cogs under the derailleur) lined up right underneath the chain.  If you are in the furthest gear, you will see the derailleur moving as you adjust the screws. So, if you need to adjust the low limit, shift to the gear on the far left, the biggest one. Adjust both screws a 1  ","only adjust your limit screws if the chain is popping out on either side of the derailleur. turn the 'h' (high) limit screw clockwise to prevent the chain from moving too far to the right, away from the bike. turn the 'l' (low) limit screw clockwise to prevent the chain from moving too far to the left (and potentially into your wheel). shift to the high and low gears, visually confirming that the derailleur is lined up with the center of the gears. test both screws and watch to see when the derailleur moves if the h and l are no longer marked.

"Disconnect the power from the unit.;  , Remove the filter to expose the cooling coils. Additionally, some models require that the front cover or bezel be removed to allow full access to the coil. Usually the cover is secured by screws - some of which become visible only when the filter is removed.  Home Depot and many other home supply centers and hardware stores sell products expressly for this particular job. These cleaners will help remove odors from deposits of dirt, mold, mildew, cigar & cigarette smoke, etc. from the coils. Use care to see that only the coils are covered with the cleaner. Prevent foam from spraying electrical wires, controls or other parts. Foaming type cleaners will work best only when used as directed.  Clean the filter with plain water or replace if missing. A clean filter is a must. It is far easier and cheaper to remove and clean the filter every 15 hours (more or less depending of dust / dirt levels in the space) than to clean the air conditioner with a foaming cleanser. If the filter is suspected of contributing to odors, soak and wash with a small amount of scented dish soap or laundry detergent.  , Set the unit to 'Cool' and adjust the thermostat to coldest setting. Warm, humid air in will condense when passing over the cold coils. The condensate will rinse the dirt and foam from the coils, and collect in the drip pan. The drip pan will drain outside - but only if the air conditioner is installed properly (back tilted slightly downward to the ground).  If the air-conditioner has been neglected, it may require a second application to produce cold air and be free of odors. Wait until the coils are free from foam before re-applying. If the unit makes cool air but fails to make condensate to wash the coils, it may be due to low of humidity. In low humidity conditions, it will take longer to rinse the coils. If the unit fails to make cool air, it has likely lost the refrigerant charge or the compressor has failed.  ,, The outside coils are exposed to rainwater and may not need cleaning. If unsure, or in a dusty or dirty area, it may help to clean them. Apply foaming cleaner with the unit off. Allow 10 - 15 minutes for the foaming cleanser to work., Since no condensate is formed on the outdoor coil when the unit is run, it will need to be rinsed manually. Do not force a direct a stream of water into the coils, but merely allow the foam to float away as the water is allowed to flow over the coils., Set to cooling and adjust thermostat to a low temperature. The discharge air should be cold and smell clean. If not, it is probably time for service or replacement.  Maintenance is great and recommended, but sometimes, it just can't be fixed.  ","unplug the air conditioner. remove the filter and bezel or cover of the unit if needed. spray the front coil of the air conditioner with a cleaning agent designed for this use. clean the filter. replace cover and filter and restore power after about 10 - 15 minutes. , run the air conditioner. repeat if necessary. shut the unit off and disconnect power. , inspect the outdoor coils. , clean the outdoor coils if desired. rinse foaming cleanser away with garden hose. reconnect power and test. know when it's time to get a new one.

Once you see that people would want to come to your club, then proceed with the rest of the steps.  Here are some things to think about:  Where will it be? Find an empty room you can use and make it Harry Potter-ish. Cover the walls in posters, display the merchandise, play Wrock at all times, have a movie playing on some sort of screen, and make everything blue, green, red, or yellow. Try to make it look like a common room, but with all four houses. Find wall stickers of things like the Hogwarts Crest, the Deathly Hallows, etc and put them on the walls.  Think of a special time when you can hold a club meeting. For example, maybe every Monday for an hour after school? And you would also need a place to meet! Some suggestions for places would be a local park, a coffee house or the library. Also, maybe you can alternate places with friends. Like one day you could have it at your friend's house, the next meeting at yours, etc.  Make posters and hang them up around town and on the local bulletin board.

"While you may be able to use this article as a guide to help you figure out if you are injured, you still must go to the doctor to get a professional diagnosis. It would be bad to think that you are ok, only to put pressure on your knee and injure it further.  Schedule an appointment for as soon as possible after the injury. If you can, you may also go to the hospital to deal with the injury right away.  When your ACL gets injured, it is referred to as a sprain rather than a broken bone because it is a ligament (though it can feel as painful as breaking a bone). The term 'sprain' refers to more than just the stretching of the ligament, it is actually the classification the is used to refer to ligament injuries. There are three levels of ACL injury.  A grade 1 ACL sprain involves mild injury to the ligament. It has been slightly stretched but not torn. It can still sustain the knee joint and will help the leg remain stable.  A grade 2 ACL sprain is when the ligament is stretched beyond its capacity to the point it becomes loose. This is when the technical term “partial tear of the ACL” is used.  A grade 3 ACL sprain makes the knee joint unstable and the ligament is completely torn apart.  You must have a doctor do this test—do not try it yourself. This is the preferred test for figuring out if you have a partial ACL tear because it can show that you have a partial tear even when the rest of the ligaments and tendons in your knee are uninjured. A doctor will:  Have you lie down on a table. Your doctor will first look at your uninjured knee to see how far your shin moves forward when your knee is bent. Your ACL keeps your shin from moving very far forward. Your doctor will then look at your injured knee and see how far your shin moves forward when the knee is bent. If it moves forward further than normal but your doctor can still feel resistance, it means that you have a partial tear. If there is no resistance, your ACL has been fully torn.  This test is meant to determine how much pressure can be put on your injured knee before it becomes unstable. Your doctor will move your injured leg a little ways away from your body (this is called hip abduction).She will then:  Straighten your leg while simultaneously press inward against the outer part of your knee and twist your leg outward. Doing this will show how well your ACL is functioning because it is a movement that only involves the ACL.  Your leg will be slowly bent while continuous pressure is put on it. When your knee is bent at a 20 to 40° angle, your doctor will look at your shin bone. If the bone slides forward a bit it means that your ACL has been partially torn.  While the ACL cannot be seen through an x-ray, your doctor can look for other evidence that you ACL has been partially torn. An x-ray of both knees is necessary to detect signs of injury such as fracture, improper alignment of the bony structures, and narrowing of the spaces between joints.All three of these injuries are associated with a partial ACL tear.  Unlike an x-ray, an MRI will help your doctor to examine your soft tissue structures in your knee, including your ACL. Your doctor will also look at your meniscus and other knee ligaments to make sure that they are not injured.  Your doctor might also request an oblique coronal image if he or she is still not sure about the extent of your injury. This image will give the doctor a better view of your knee in addition to the MRI.  ","go to a doctor if you notice any of the symptoms listed in this article. be aware that there are three grades of acl injury. have a doctor perform the lachman test. be prepared for the pivot shift test. have an x-ray taken of your knee. know that an mri might need to be done.

"If you have a lawn that you'd like to make Halloween-ready, there are many creepy things you can do to decorate the outside of your home. The lawn sets the tone for the rest of the home, so if it's spooky enough, it'll make people even curious to see what you have in store up-close. Here are some easy ways to decorate your lawn:Old crunchy fall leaves should cover the ground. If there haven't been many fallen leaves, you should avoid raking your lawn during the days leading up to Halloween to make the most of what you have.  Take an old pair of boots and have them emerging out of a big pile of leaves or dirt. This will make it look like there's a dead body on your lawn!  Stick tombstones out of the ground. Remember that Halloween is all about things being old, dingy, and falling-apart, so your lawn does not have to be perfectly arranged. Have a tombstone here, a tombstone there, and another tombstone that is completely crooked or falling over.  If you have trees, cover them with spider webs. Bonus points if you can stick some creepy-crawly critters in them, or if you can add a stuffed owl or raven to a low-hanging branch.  Don't underestimate the power of a scary scarecrow. You can get a special Halloween scarecrow, or take your ordinary corn-husk fall scarecrow and paint it with blood.  Throw some skulls around the ground. Kudos if one of your guests accidentally stumbles on one of them.  Have a skeleton popping out of your yard.  If you really want to do it up for Halloween, have your car parked out on the lawn. Paint the windows to make it look like they're cracked, and make it look like a person is trapped inside by putting in a dummy with its hands pushed against the windows.;  , Your front porch will be the portal to all of the creepy things inside your home, so it should be as scary as possible to lure your unsuspecting guests (or victims) inside your house of horrors. Here are some great ways to add some Halloween spice to your front porch:  Add some more spiderwebs to your porch. Your guests could get caught in them without knowing it.  The silhouette of a black cat or two will raise the creep factor.  A few stuffed rats on the floor will help set the scene.  A bucket of dead white flowers will look perfect on your porch.  Scatter some tree branches on the ground.  A few pumpkins will add a nice touch to your porch. They can be carved with ghoulish designs, or painted black, silver, or with glitter.  Hang a ghost from your porch. Just cut some holes in an old sheet and throw it over an old beach ball that you hang from the ceiling.  If you have an old rocking chair, cover it with spider webs and put it in a place where it will rock and creak as much as possible.  The door and window are the eyes and mouth of your home's Halloween soul, so you should make the most of them. Adding just a few ghoulish touches to your front door and windows will make your house look haunted. Here are a few things to try:  Have a spooky doormat. It can have a picture of a spiderweb or a ghost on it.  Hang a wreath covered in bats on the front door.  Splatter some fake blood on your front door. Just make sure it can easily come off.  If you're really going all out, make it look like you've boarded up your windows by sticking some light wood beams over the glass and sticking them to the glass with duct tape. This will make your house look abandoned, and therefore spooky.  Take an old mannequin and cover it in a formal black or red dress. Stick it in a window that everyone will see, preferably a second-floor or attic window if you have one. Shine a flashlight under the mannequin to create a ghostly effect.  ","decorate your lawn. decorate your front porch. decorate your front door and windows. "
"As difficult as it may be to come to terms with, the first step to reconciling with your estranged parents is acknowledging the part you may have played in losing touch with them to begin with.Don’t blame yourself for the rift that developed, but be willing to acknowledge and accept that some of the blame may be yours for the time you’ve spent apart.  The only way you and your parents will be able to reconcile is if you are each willing to shoulder some of the responsibility.;  , It can be difficult to empathize with the pain of estranged parents. You may still have some very difficult feelings to work through, and when something or someone hurts you, it can be difficult to see beyond our own pain.Remember that sometimes the decisions we make when we’re hurt aren’t always good ones.  Losing touch with a child can be especially painful, even if they don’t act like they’ve been hurt. Remember that not seeing the pain doesn’t mean it wasn’t there.  Understanding what your parents were going through when you stopped communicating can help you forgive them, and appreciating what they may be experiencing now will make it easier to find common ground when you meet.Your parents may have been experiencing a low point in their lives when you stopped talking. Remember that parents are nothing more than people, and people struggle with internal and external challenges.  All of the feelings of fear and anxiety you have about reconciling with your parents are probably going through their heads too.  This is an important step that you will need to come to terms with at your own pace. You parents may have done things that truly hurt you, but by trying to consider their perspective and acknowledging that they have felt pain regarding losing you may help you to overcome the desire to blame them. Remember that blame won’t solve anything now, only love can.Acknowledge that you and your parents all share at least some responsibility for losing touch, but that doesn’t mean blame needs to be assigned.  Instead of placing blame, focus on the future and how good it will feel to have your parents back in your life.  While seemingly simple, choosing a place to meet is important because you want to make sure everyone is comfortable and that you can speak without time constraints. Depending on how you and your parents feel, you may choose to meet at one of your homes or maybe a restaurant for dinner.Ask them if they have any preference as to a place you can meet. Depending on the nature of your relationship they may prefer a public place over one of your homes.  Meeting at a restaurant offers everyone the ability to leave when they wish, instead of waiting for others to leave their home. That way if things get uncomfortable, you can excuse yourself.  Try to choose a time and place that won’t limit the time you can spend talking so you aren’t forced to end your conversation earlier than you each wanted.  You may be tempted to simply act cordial when you meet with your parents for fear that you may lose touch again if you demonstrate any negative feelings. While it’s important to be polite, you need to be able to voice how you feel in order to begin the healing process.Use “I” statements like, “I felt abandoned when you left.” This keeps your emphasis on you and how you felt.  Avoid making accusatory statements like “you never cared.” Instead say, “I felt like you didn’t care.” This allows for the possibility that you can only fully appreciate what was going on inside your mind and that you’re willing to hear what was going through theirs.  You might regret some of the things you said or did before losing touch with your parents. If that’s the case, tell them so. Saying sorry can make you feel significantly better, and it can help make your parents feel more comfortable as they begin to understand that you are willing to accept a share of the responsibility.No one wants to feel attacked, and by acknowledging that you made mistakes and that you’re sorry for them, you invite your parents to do the same.  Apologizing can make you feel better too. If you’ve felt guilty about something for many years, apologizing can feel very freeing; like taking a weight off of your shoulders.  You may have an idea of what you hope will be said, or things you hope will happen when you meet with your parents, but try not to place too much emphasis on what you hope will happen. Instead allow things to progress naturally without being disappointed that they didn’t live up to your expectations.You may be surprised by some of the things your parents have to say. Keeping an open mind will limit the chances of feeling let down that things didn’t progress exactly how you’d hoped.  Everyone processes their feelings in different ways, and sometimes it may take a little longer for some people than it does for others to come around.  After meeting with your parents, you may want to bring up what comes next before you leave. You may want to set a time and place where you can meet up again. Saying you’d like to continue to see one another can help you and your parents both understand that you hope to end the time you spent without each other in your lives.Your parents may be surprised and pleased to know that you’d like to see them again and that your meeting isn’t simply a one-time thing.  Remember that healing will take time, both for you and for them. Setting up another time and place to meet in the future will give you each time to process what has gone on and come back again fresh.  If you and your parents feel it is necessary, you may want to seek out the services of a family counselor that can help you and your parents work through some of your more difficult feelings.  Counselors can offer suggestions for things you and your parents can do to reconnect after so many years apart.  Working with a counselor can help ensure your conversations don’t stray into unproductive or hurtful territory like blaming one another and not trying to understand each other’s feelings.  Giving your parents validation for their presence in your life can help strengthen the new bonds that you are creating. Ask them for advice on things they know a lot about, or let them help you with a project around the house.  Giving a productive reason for continued interaction with your parents can help you establish new and beneficial emotional connections with them.  Your parents likely want to help, so by making subtle gestures like simply asking their opinions on what new car to buy, what color to paint your living room or where to get a good deal on a new grill can make them feel like they’re bringing something positive to the table.  As your new relationship develops with your parents, remember that positive relationships are two way streets. You may want your parents to be there for you as they haven’t been in a long time, but they may also be struggling with emotions that they aren’t sure how to deal with.Be patient and understanding when your parents open up to you about their struggles.  Say things like, “I’m here for you, that’s what family is for,” to emphasize the bond you are recreating with them and that it’s a relationship you are willing to work to maintain.  Remember that Rome wasn’t built in a day, and neither are good relationships. There will be challenges, hurt feelings, and maybe even arguments as you work to re-build your bond with your parents. Allow your relationship to develop as slowly as it needs to, and allow your parents (and yourself) an opportunity to take a step back and process your feelings at your own pace.  Don’t expect everything to feel better right away. Long standing emotions take time to dissipate.  Your parents may not respond as quickly as you do, or you may have trouble overcoming some feelings that they don’t. Respect that each of you will have to process your new relationship in your own way.  ","take responsibility for your part. acknowledge that they’re hurt too. try to understand their perspective. move past blame. set a time and place to talk. be honest about your feelings. say sorry if you are. keep an open mind. discuss where to go from here. consider going to counseling. validate their presence in your life. be there for them. keep realistic expectations.

"Trying to hold off on using the bathroom will lead to many more instances of leaks. Use the bathroom whenever you first feel the urge to go.Also, make sure you use the bathroom whenever you can if you’re going long distances between stops.;  , Constipation contributes to stress incontinence by increasing abdominal pressure and stimulating nerves near the rectum that increase urinary frequency.You can take simple steps at home to treat constipation, including:Eating more high-fiber fruits, vegetables, and grains  Staying hydrated  Staying physically active  You can find more specific information at How to Regulate Bowel Movements  , A variety of foods and drinks can irritate your bladder or act as a diuretic (which means it makes you have to urinate more often).You may react to some but not all of these options. Try to isolate them in your diet to find out the ones that increase your stress incontinence. Some common options that increase stress incontinence include:Caffeine  Carbonated beverages  Citrus  Chocolate  Alcohol  Spicy foods  , If you still have occurrences after eliminating bladder-irritating beverages, then try to reduce your overall fluid intake;however, do not risk dehydrating yourself. Only reduce the amount of fluid you drink if you already drink more than the suggested eight to ten glasses of water a day.  Reduce the amount of liquid that you are drinking after 4:00 if you are having problems in the evening and at night.  In addition to a wide array or other health complications, smoking can also irritate your bladder, leading to overactive symptoms and increased incidence of stress incontinence. Many smokers also develop a chronic cough, which can cause more instances of leakage.Trying to stop smoking cold turkey rarely works for most smokers. Take advantage of available smoking cessation aids such as nicotine patches and gum, as well as support communities to taper off your tobacco addiction.  You can find more information related to smoking cessation at How to Quit Smoking.  Carrying extra weight can place increased pressure on your bladder and pelvic floor muscles.Professionals consider a body mass index (BMI) of 25 or higher overweight (with 30 meaning obese).Even the moderate loss of some excess weight can lead to dramatic improvement with symptoms.A great exercise routine for shedding extra pounds includes thirty minutes of moderate aerobic activity (such as brisk walking or cycling) five times a week. If you prefer high-intensity workouts (such as playing sports), then aim for seventy-five minutes a week.Note that weight training is not as effective at burning calories as aerobic exercise. In fact, chronic heavy lifting can increase stress incontinence by reducing the strength of your pelvic floor.Learn more about calculating your BMI at How to Calculate Your Body Mass Index (BMI).  Some doctors suggest that you wear a tampon if you are having stress incontinence symptoms when you do exercise like running, as this increases support in the vagina.Remember not to leave you tampon in order to prevent toxic shock syndrome.  Eating right is just as important to losing extra weight as exercise. Cut out processed foods, sugary foods and beverages, and sources high in saturated fat. Instead opt for a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean meats (fish and skinless chicken), and whole grains. Consult your doctor about the most effective changes you can make to your diet.  Weakened pelvic floor muscles (often from childbirth) are a leading cause of stress incontinence. Up to 75 percent of women with the condition have success with Kegel exercises to strengthen these muscles (though both men and women can do them).YHave patience because it can take weeks or even months to show results.To perform Kegel exercises, isolate the muscles by intentionally stopping the flow of urine next time you go.Once you know what using those muscles feels like, hold them tight for an eight count before relaxing them while counting to ten. Do ten repetitions three times daily.You can also start with a lower count and increase it over time.  You can also try vaginal weights, which are cone-shaped weights that you insert into your vagina like a tampon and help to strengthen the pelvic floor muscles. You will start with a low weight, holding it for one minute twice a day. Once you can hold that weight for 15 minutes, you move up to the next heaviest weight.Yoga has also been shown to strengthen the pelvic floor muscles. Postures like fish, pike, or crow work in the very same way as Kegel exercises., These steps take time. While you’re waiting for results, you can take other steps to reduce the appearance and amount of leakage you experience. You should:  Cross your legs when you start laughing or feel a cough or sneeze coming on, which will help support your bladder and reduce pressure.  Line your underwear with a stress incontinence product. These pads will stop any staining on your clothing and reduce odor.  Tighten your Kegel muscles and buttocks when sitting to reduce other unintentional leakage.  If you’re diabetic, then changes in blood sugar can lead to increased incidence of stress incontinence.Monitor your blood sugar regularly and keep it under control by staying physically active and watching your diet.  ","use the bathroom often. treat any unresolved constipation. eliminate foods and drinks that cause bladder irritation. reduce fluid intake. quit smoking. get more exercise. balance your diet. strengthen your pelvic floor muscles. use tricks to reduce the amount of leakage. manage your blood sugar.

"Feed one end of the thread into your sewing needle and draw the thread halfway through. Tie both ends together into a knot.  If you want to camouflage the whipstitch, use thread in a coordinating color. If you want the whipstitch to stand out, use thread of a contrasting color.  Embroidery thread works well for this stitch, but any thick thread can be used.  To tie the knot, try moistening your forefinger. Wrap the thread around your forefinger once. Then use your thumb to push the thread off your finger, twisting it in the process. Finally, pull the end of the thread to tighten the knot.;  , Make sure that the edges you intend to sew together are evenly aligned. The sides of the fabric which you intend to be the backend should face out so as to be visible during the process. The thread you use here will be more visible.  Pin or baste the layers together to hold them in place.  While looking at the two layers of fabric from the side, draw the needle up through the bottom of the top layer, leaving the bottom layer untouched.  Start your stitch about 1/8 inch (3.175 mm) from the end.Also note that each stitch you make should be 1/8 inch (3.175 mm) away from your sewn edge, as well.  By only piercing through the top layer, you will draw the knot between the two layers, thereby hiding it from sight.  Circle the needle around to the bottom layer of fabric and pierce through the fabric directly under your first hole. Draw it straight through both layers of fabric, making sure that it comes out in nearly the same position as your first half-stitch.  This is your first full stitch since it connects both layers together.  When you complete this step, the thread should be wrapped around the edges of both layers in an even stitch, forming a loop around the outside of the fabric.Make sure that the stitch is secure, but not so tight that it causes the fabric to bunch up.  Bring the needle back to the bottom of the fabric and poke it up through both layers of fabric. Angle the needle so that it comes out roughly 1/8 inch (3.175 mm) away from the first stitch.  This second stitch will essentially cover the first stitch.  Pull the thread tight. When done, you should only be able to see what appears to be one stitch, but the thread should come out from fabric in a blank spot next to the stitch.  Each stitch should be approximately 1/8 inch from one another and from the edge of the fabric, so that each stich is parallel., Position the needle beneath the bottom side of the fabric. Poke it up into both layers of fabric, beginning just beneath the spot at which the thread is coming up. Angle the needle so that it comes out through the top another 1/8 inch (3.175 mm) away from the previous stitch.  The stitch itself should not appear angular, however. It should run straight up and down over the edge, parallel to the first stitch., Continue making stitches that mimic the previous one. Draw the needle up through both layers, starting at a point beneath the previous stitch and ending at a position 1/8 inch (3.175 mm) away. Do this until you reach the end of the edge.  Note that the majority of your stitches will follow this pattern, but your last full stitch and half stitch will be different and will mimic the stitches you made at the beginning of the process.  For your final full stitch, pierce the needle through the bottom layer and draw it straight up through both layers instead of stitching at an angle. This stitch should be made 1/8 inch (3.175 mm) away from the edge of the fabric, just as the first one was.  Poke the needle up through the bottom layer again, in the same spot as your previous stitch. Only bring the thread through the bottom layer, however, and not the top layer.  In this step, you are mirroring the initial half stitch you created at the beginning of the process. This stitch will be hidden in between both layers of fabric., Draw the needle through the back of the last stitch you made. Pull the layers apart slightly to reveal the backside of your stitches. Open up the pieces of fabric like two leaves of a book. Wrap the needle through your last stitch, creating a loose loop in the process. Thread the fabric back around, twisting it around the original loop. Then pull tight.This knot should also be hidden in between the two layers of fabric.  After creating the knot, cut your thread to free it from the needle. Trim it short so that it cannot be visible from the front side.  Gently pull the two layers apart, causing the stitches to flatten evenly against the fabric. This step completes the process.  ","thread the needle. arrange two pieces of fabric on top of each other. poke your needle up through the top layer of fabric. poke your needle up through both layers of fabric. bring the needle up through both layers again at an angle. make another angular stitch through both layers. repeat the pattern as needed. create your final full stitch. make a half stitch in between layers. tie a finishing knot. flatten the stitches.

"The Siberian Husky, although generally child-friendly, needs to have social boundaries – no jumping, grabbing, chasing, bolting, or pulling – established. Children should follow similar boundaries – no teasing; roughing; chasing; pulling hair, tail, or ears; or tug-of-war. Children should help train your husky under adult supervision so that the husky becomes comfortable and familiar with all family members.  Teaching children to gently pet and touch a husky, instead of pulling or hitting, helps build a trusting friendship and affection for each other.  Other than bringing home a puppy, an unfamiliar husky’s background should always be taken into account around children. Find out if the husky was raised or socialized with children previously to bringing them home. Check to see if the husky ever received training for contact with children. Visually watch your husky around children to identify irritability, nervousness, or growling. Naturally, Siberian Huskies have an instinct to chase small animals and sometimes children. Because huskies see small animals, like cats, as food, they might mistake babies or toddlers as part of the pack (family) and mistakenly attack them.  Always have a new dog on a leash around children so that you remain in control and can prevent any injury.  Few children will understand the meaning of a dog’s body language unless they are taught to identify aggressive behavior. Angry dogs typically bark, growl, show their teeth, and stare at their target. Children should never approach a dog under these circumstances. Instead, the child should immediately stop moving, stand up straight with arms at their side and legs close together, and look away from the dog to avoid eye contact. If the dog attacks anyways, the child should drop to the ground, curl up with knees to the chest, and arms covering the face with fists over the ears. Disengage by being quiet. , Training should begin several weeks or months prior to a newborn’s arrival. Obedience training – how to sit, stay, lie down, or approach – should commence immediately and continue until your husky becomes reliable.  Practice at home with a baby doll to simulate situations, smells, and new sounds where it is essential for your husky to obey a command. Make sure not to get lulled into a false sense of security. If your husky is not obeying commands completely and regularly it might be best to seek out a good obedience school or trainer.  To prevent the dog from jumping, wildly sniffing, or misbehaving in general, the mother should greet the husky upon arrival without the baby for a few minutes until the excitement winds down. This also presents an opportunity for your husky to sniff mom’s clothes for new smells. Once your husky is relaxed the baby can be introduced.  It is natural to give more attention to your newborn baby than to your dog. Nevertheless, do not neglect your dog or make him jealous. Prepare in advance by gradually reducing the amount of attention the dog normally receives a few weeks in advance of the baby’s arrival.  Infants are different from children. Dogs usually identify children as people but this is not always true with infants. Become familiar with your dog’s “typical” behavior and reactions around children. Check to make sure the dog imitates this behavior around the baby.  ","build mutual respect between the dog and children. identify potential risk factors. understand your husky's body language. get your husky ready for the arrival of a newborn. "
"Eye contact establishes trust and makes you appear more reliable and friendly. The best photos will show you gazing straight ahead and giving your full attention to the camera and, by proxy, to the current profile reader.Sunglasses are a great look for many people, but they also make you appear closed-off and cold. Limit yourself to only one sunglasses shot in your profile.  A natural look is always nice with facial shots. But if you simply feel more comfortable and 'you' in make-up, then by all means put some on. Just make sure to keep it light and as close to natural looking as possible.  Polls show that 96% of people respond more positively to a big smile (showing teeth) than to a sexy closed-mouth smirk or pout. Smiling makes you more accessible and it conveys your happiness to others. It is not necessary to include only smiling photos as that may seem odd with action shots, but do try to trend toward the smiley., Your main profile image should be all about you. It will let your potential admirers know how to identify you immediately amongst your other photos. Use a shot that shows off your best physical attributes. The more of your face and body that is visible the better.  It is really tempting to use a selfie, but try to find a photo alternative. Selfies can seem a bit anti-social and the mirror ones often appear staged., Add a few photos of you doing something that you love. Do you love baseball or softball? Show a picture of you in the batting cage. Do you rock climb? Post a pic of you heading up to a peak. These shots will draw in people with similar interests to you.The action shot is a good opportunity to show your whole body as well, which is a near-to requirement for online profiles., Add one or two shots of you with a group of friends or family. Avoid the late-night bar pics and instead post something showcasing your extended social network. This shouldn’t be your first pic, but it is a good middle option.Consider blocking out your friends' faces if you know that they prefer to keep a low profile online. You can do this with free online photo editing tools.  No one wants to look at a bunch of blurs. Post images that are clear with a good, distinct background. Bright colors and lighting are especially good. They are automatically associated with happiness and summery fun.When asked to compare the people in summertime versus winter pics the summery photo subjects were consistently judged to be more attractive and fun.Professional photos can be a good option as long as they are not awkward or too staged.However, avoid using a professional photo taken with a flash as it can add up to 7 years to your appearance.  ","look into the camera. smile!, be the only person in your primary profile pic. throw in a few “action” shots. include “social shots” of you out with friends. use only high-quality photos. "

"Becoming a fearless goalie starts with practicing and perfecting basic soccer playing skills so you are more comfortable on the field. As the goalkeeper you are the last line of defense for your team. During your training focus on your reflexes, reaction time, as well as your overall agility.For reflex training, have your teammates line up in front of the goal each with their own ball. Have each of them kick the ball from different distances and at different speeds so that you have a variety of situations to deal with. This will get you used to high intensity game play, as well as work on the reflexes needed to be a fearless goalie.  To practice your reaction time, have your coach line up two rows of balls in front of the goal, one row closer to the goal than the other. Your coach will kick the balls into the goal (the closer ones will come off the ground a bit while the farther ones will stay lower, creating an erratic pattern). Your job is to keep all the balls from getting into the goal.;  , As with most sports, keeping your eye on the ball is key. When training, use a smaller ball than your standard soccer ball. This will help you focus better and make it easier for you to catch, block, and maneuver the larger soccer ball once you're in the game., Having quick feet is very important for the goalkeeper. You have to be able to move back and forth, jump, and move out of the way very quickly. Make sure you master the two most common forms of footwork used by goalies, side-to-side and crossover.Side-to-side. Train for this kind of footwork by keeping the ball between your feet and quickly kicking it back and forth between the insides of your feet. Once comfortable with that movement start to practice keeping the ball moving from side to side between your feet while moving your whole body forward and backward.Crossover. This involves swiftly crossing one foot in front of the other to get the ball.To practice this, bounce the ball off the top of your cleats about knee height back and forth, and then to waist height. Cross your right leg over the ball as it’s descending from waist height and try to catch the ball again with your other foot.Mastering these soccer drills during your training will help you gain confidence in your soccer playing abilities, and confidence leads to fearlessness!, Looking at your opponent's head specifically is key to helping you predict where the ball might be heading.If the player is looking down, there's a 99% chance that the ball will not leave the ground. If the player is looking straight ahead, the ball might come off the ground a bit, but will come at you straight and hard. If the player is leaning back as they kick the ball, the ball is going to leave the ground.Pay attention to the position of your opponent's body and feet if you approach them. Most people are right-footed, and will likely kick it to your right hand side. Try to swing your right foot around, with the inside of your foot facing the ball to block it. This will help you anticipate what your opponent is likely to do, with less fear of unknown outcomes.  No one likes getting hit by an unexpected ball, having a good idea of where the ball is likely to come at you helps you brace for it and be less fearful of getting hit by it.  Being the goalie is a tough job, stand confidently with your head up and shoulders back. Stay calm at all times and remember it is okay to get hit with the ball, so go for every shot! It’s easy to get discouraged by missing shots, so don't sweat it. Keep in mind how important your job is, and that all you can do is give it your best effortUnderstand that the goalie position is a very tough position. Accept the fact that you are going to get hit, kicked, and maybe even stepped on, but that it is all part of the game. Mentally preparing for the likelihood of physical injury will help you feel prepared for anything the game might throw at you, so you won't waste time thinking about the possibility of getting hurt and can focus on the game.  Do not get scared and stand there waiting for your opponent to make a shot. If possible, attack and take control of the ball, this can help to startle them instead!, Being the goalie means you have the advantage of using your hands and arms. Don't be afraid to give it your all. Dive, lunge, and jump to block the ball if you have to.  If your opponent successfully gets the ball around you, run and slide diagonally toward their right hand side. If they try to kick it to the right, your feet will block it. If they kick it to the left, stretch your hands out to catch it. Try to keep your legs closer to your opponent than your face to avoid injury. Being fearless doesn't mean you purposefully jeopardize your own safety for the sake of the game.  Never try to kick the ball past an approaching opponent, this leaves your goal more vulnerable. Always kick it away from them if possible.  Make sure you have a teammate who is able to receive the ball before kicking or throwing it back into play., Penalty shots can be one of the most intimidating aspects of goalkeeping, mastering them will make you less fearful of them.  Never wait for the penalty shot on your heels; stay in the middle of the goal on your toes at all times so you can react faster. Remember, the player will have a chance to run up to the ball so there's a good chance the ball is not going to stay on the ground.  When diving to block the ball, try to keep your arms stretched out as far as you can and remain ready to receive the ball.  Never close your eyes as you lunge or dive for the ball.  If you can't catch the ball, grab it. Be aggressive and quickly scoop the ball up before the opposing team approaches and tries another shot at the goal.  ","hone your basic soccer skills. focus on hand-eye coordination. practice your footwork. look at players’ stances. have a strong and resilient mindset about your position. approach opponents aggressively. use your whole body. kick the ball away from your opponent. become a master of penalty shots. dive for penalty shots.

"Make sure the evening can include mostly non-constructive tasks that can keep your off your busy daytime doings yet subtle enough in keeping your mind ready to drift off to dreamland. While blanket sleepers can help drift you back to sleep just before bedtime, they also have a secondary life during the evening hours shortly after most people get off the dinner table in which can get you ready to sleep with it on. Plan around the blanket sleeper's use wherever you are settling in that evening - whether that be at home, at a neighbor, friend, or relative's house or at another dwelling elsewhere.  Blanket sleepers can surely help you lounge around the house while watching TV or reading a book or doing something that won't involve much work or thought behind the action.;  , Many people struggle to find just 'that right time' when they feel competent and ready to wear one and most struggle at first to get into one - and others to stay in them - during the evening and nighttime hours. It's often a chore that most blanket sleeper wearers dread - especially at first. Don't think about the garment as being a child-like blanket sleeper - think about them being just your ordinary night wear pajama that you love to wear each night - one that keeps you coming back to wearing them time and time again., Whether it's just a few hours off or it is only a few minutes off, evening hours means chilling and relaxing and getting ready to enter that state of sleep mode for most blanket sleeper wearers. Although most people begin to wear blanket sleepers only during the night, some tend to wear them non-stop throughout the evening and even into the next morning somewhat - and that's actually a good thing. Many wearers feel good enough to leave them on until they must remove them for other projects that are less comfortable and that they need to devote more attention to during the course of their normal day.  Close all your drapes, turn on some ambient lighting and - if you'd like to - set the room's music level to some low-action 'romantic-like' (almost towards a classical genre) music for which you can perform this one evening's tasks in. Keeping the mood peaceful and out of the thought of the wearer and on the action at hand will be your best thoughts towards achieving a great wearing time during the evening.  If your sleeper contains pockets, stick in some of these items into the pockets so you don't have very far to reach when they are necessary to be used. Whether that low intensity item is a television remote control, landline and/or cellular phone or a small or other short book (such as a Harlequin romance book or similar short novel) or something else that will help you adjust to this piece of loungewear (and thereby get yourself ready for 'sleep mode'), it's best that you get everything ready for the evening hours.  Be sure to state to yourself the reason why you chose to do so. Even though you'd be escaping those hours when daytime use yields problems and escaping those hours that night-only use proves challenging to endure, evening use may prove to be difficult to ensure when others may end up coming over unexpectedly.  You tried them on and found out that you could be courageous enough to wear one, and don't complain. Becoming courageous is something many people can't seem to muster, even though most people's minds are set to remove something that's seen as childlike, fairly-quickly. Embrace your inner child every night if you are not courageous enough to show it off to yourself and others.  At this point, you don't need to have them in your hands accomplish this cleanse into trying them on for the night. This will provide for a more-confident feel on your body, knowing that you are now 'at peace' with your mind, body and soul. Don't scream or do anything harsh that would make you want to remove the blanket sleeper onwards until the next morning when most people take off the sleeper., Change yourself into your blanket sleeper, as if you were your own children. Most adults will have to drape their legs over the edge of their bed because they are much larger than that of a child, to ensure they are wearing their sleeper for these evening hours.  ","organize your evening hours well. decide if you are absolutely ready and comfortable enough to wear one now. determine if you can be ready to fall asleep. make sure to provide a serene setting in which you can encase yourself into a blanket sleeper again. assemble the calm and collected things you have chosen to do during these hours to pass the time by in an easy-to-reach place such as in your sleepers pockets (if they have them) or nearby the chair you wish to use prior to falling asleep. have some great reasons ready for why you are wearing them, should other people - family, friends, relatives or others - come over to see you in your house or apartment that evening and find you wearing them. don't complain about your body when you have them on. sit down on a padded seat, take a cleansing breath in and release your breath after a few seconds have elapsed. utilize your bed for a few moments.proceed to do your calm down activities in the house, that you were supposed to set up before you got yourself dressed for the evening hours.

"In some cases, it can be trivially easy to tell if an equation is exact just from inspection. For example, ydx+xdy=0{\displaystyle y{\mathrm {d} }x+x{\mathrm {d} }y=0} is exact, because the mixed partials as stated in the introduction both equal 1. Most other equations require that we manually take the partial derivatives and check for equality.  Consider the equation below.  (x+x2y2−exy3+y)dx+(23x3y−3exy2+x+2y)dy=0{\displaystyle (x+x^{2}y^{2}-e^{x}y^{3}+y){\mathrm {d} }x+\left({\frac {2}{3}}x^{3}y-3e^{x}y^{2}+x+2y\right){\mathrm {d} }y=0}  Calculate partial derivatives.  ∂P∂y=2x2y−3exy2+1{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial P}{\partial y}}=2x^{2}y-3e^{x}y^{2}+1}  ∂Q∂x=2x2y−3exy2+1{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial Q}{\partial x}}=2x^{2}y-3e^{x}y^{2}+1}  Because the partials are equal, the equation is exact.  ;  , We know that the relation P=∂f∂x{\displaystyle P={\frac {\partial f}{\partial x}}} must be true, if f{\displaystyle f} is a solution to the differential equation. However, this is a partial derivative, so doing the integration will only uncover part of the information needed. We can also choose to integrate Q{\displaystyle Q} with respect to y.{\displaystyle y.}  f=∫∂f∂xdx=∫Pdx=∫(x+x2y2−exy3+y)dx=12x2+13x3y2−exy3+xy+R(y){\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}f&=\int {\frac {\partial f}{\partial x}}{\mathrm {d} }x=\int P{\mathrm {d} }x\\&=\int (x+x^{2}y^{2}-e^{x}y^{3}+y){\mathrm {d} }x\\&={\frac {1}{2}}x^{2}+{\frac {1}{3}}x^{3}y^{2}-e^{x}y^{3}+xy+R(y)\end{aligned}}}  The constant of integration R(y){\displaystyle R(y)} represents this incomplete information, in that any arbitrary function of y{\displaystyle y} only will satisfy P.{\displaystyle P.} If we chose to integrate Q,{\displaystyle Q,} our constant of integration will be with respect to x{\displaystyle x} only.  Likewise, the condition ∂f∂y=Q{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial f}{\partial y}}=Q} must hold as well. What we find is that the terms in Q{\displaystyle Q} that are purely a function of y{\displaystyle y} equal dRdy.{\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }R}{{\mathrm {d} }y}}.} If we did it the other way, then we would take the derivative with respect to x{\displaystyle x} and find that the terms in P{\displaystyle P} that are purely a function of x{\displaystyle x} must satisfy dRdx.{\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }R}{{\mathrm {d} }x}}.}  ∂f∂y=23x3y2−3exy2+dRdy=Q{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial f}{\partial y}}={\frac {2}{3}}x^{3}y^{2}-3e^{x}y^{2}+{\frac {{\mathrm {d} }R}{{\mathrm {d} }y}}=Q}  By inspection, we can see that dRdy=2y.{\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }R}{{\mathrm {d} }y}}=2y.}  , With practice, you can jump straight to inspecting Q{\displaystyle Q} for any pure y{\displaystyle y} terms (or P{\displaystyle P} for any pure x{\displaystyle x} terms, if we did it the other way) and integrating them.  R=y2{\displaystyle R=y^{2}}  , The solution contains an arbitrary constant C,{\displaystyle C,} as usual. We also see that this function is defined implicitly.

"This table top is a 3'x3' square of 3/4' thick plywood. The legs are 1½' x 1½' square and about 37' long, with triangular braces cut from 1½' x 8'x 12' wooden pieces. The legs are splayed out slightly to give the table strength, and to allow the rotary pendulum to swing without hitting a leg.  Screw and/or glue the braces to the legs first, and then cut their tops together at a slight angle with a table or circular saw.  Adjust the leg lengths to give a table-top height of about 37'.  If you want to be able to fit the table through doorways without taking off the legs, you might need slightly shorter legs and pendulums.  ;  , Drill 3 holes of 3' diameter through the table surface for the pendulums to hang through. The hole for the rotary pendulum should be centered in a corner about 8' from each side just clear of the leg brace underneath. The other two holes should be aligned near the opposite edges, about 8' from the common side, and 3' from the other. You'll need a special large circular drill bit for this. Alternatively you can first drill a smaller hole, and then cut a wider opening with a jigsaw.  Start the indentation in the metal plate with a small drill bit (such as 1/8') and then continue with a larger bit (such as 1/4'). Be careful not to drill all the way through.  Unless you have a good drill press, it may be easier to position the indentations of the plates on the table after you create the fulcrum blocks with protruding screws below, because it can be harder to accurately position the screws in the blocks later to align with the indentations.  The pendulum shafts are made from 4' long 3/4' diameter wooden dowels. Hardwood blocks, 3/4' x 1½' oak, are used as a fulcrums so the pendulums can rest and rock on the table with minimal friction. For the two lateral pendulums, use 5' long blocks, and for the rotary pendulum, use a 2¼' long block. Drill a 3/4' hole through the center of each block, and screw 1¼' #10 screws through each end. The tips of the screws will rest in the indentations of the metal plates on the table to keep them in place while rocking.  Glue and/or screw them such that the screw tips are 12' from the top end of the dowel and facing downwards. The pendulum should hang down 36' below the top surface of the table with about a 1' clearance from the floor.  The rotary pendulum needs a gimbal mechanism that allows it to swing in any direction. This is made from a large metal washer with 2½' outer and 1' inner diameter. The washer rests on screw tips protruding from under the table, and then the pendulum rests on the washer. Drill pairs of indentations into the washer on each side, off 90 degrees between the sides, to allow rocking on two perpendicular axes.  Here are views of the rotary pendulum gimbal from above and below the table. In the view from below, note the oak blocks (3/4' x 1½' x 5') supporting the two screws (1¾' #10) protruding upwards and diagonally.  Likewise file down the corners of the fulcrum block if necessary so it doesn't hit the table when swinging.  2½ lb lifting weights from a sporting goods store work well, but typically have a 1' interior hole. You can stack several weights and slide them together onto the 3/4' pendulum dowel by using a 5' long 3/4' metal pipe nipple, with a 3/4' to 1' bushing screwed onto the lower end. A 1' steel clamp attached to the dowel fixes the weights from sliding off, and allows easy adjustment of the weight's height to give different swinging frequencies.  Cut about 1' off the top of the rotary pendulum dowel, so it is slightly lower than the other two. Then mount an 11'x11' square of thin 1/8' board to the top of this pendulum, using a small oak block glued to it for support, with a 3/4' hole for the dowel.  Wrap some tape around the top of the dowel to get a tight fit, or just glue it on.  Use two rubber bands, or some clips, to hold the paper in place on the platform.  Connect a 30' long balsa stick to the top of each lateral pendulum using a thin nail. Bend the nail back and forth a little in the balsa to allow the the arm to rotate smoothly and move up and down slightly. The nail hole will slowly loosen further during use.  Note that if you plan to use your harmonograph regularly, such as in a museum setting, a more robust solution for these arms that won't wear as quickly might be necessary.  To make a simple pen-holder, drill a 1/2' hole on the end of one arm, and cut about 4' down the center of the arm to make a clothes-pin like device. Alternatively, just glue a real clothes-pin to the end of one of the arms. Pictures of both versions are shown.  It is convenient to be able to raise and lower the pen gently without disturbing the motion of the pendulums. To do this, insert a 30' pole into a hole near the center of the table, just far enough from the paper platform that it won't be hit by it (about 12' from the rotary pendulum hole).  ,  ","start by building a sturdy table. drill holes for the pendulums. mount two metal plates (about 1¼' x 4') on the sides of the two lateral pendulum holes, and drill a small indentation in the center of each plate. build the pendulums. insert a dowel through the 3/4' hole in each fulcrum block. build the gimbal. file down the bottom edges of these blocks as needed so the pendulum doesn't hit them when it swings. attach the weights. create the paper platform. create the arms. finally attach the two arms together with a doubled-over rubber band as shown. fashion a pen holder. make the pen lifter. attach an oak block under the table for a deeper hole and better support. , tie a string to the balsa arms where they are connected together, lead it through a screw-eye on top of the pole, and back down to a small jam cleat or groove where it can hold the pen in place above the paper until you are ready to lower it.

"A wok is large pan with sloped sides. Woks are ideal for this type of frying because you can cook in stages. While you can use a skillet for stir-frying, the results will not be as consistent or as tasty., Stir-frying is similar to sautéing in that it requires you to cut up your foods before you cook them. Make sure that all pieces are roughly the same size and weight. This will ensure uniform cooking. Have them all chopped and ready before you heat the pan. , Set the stove to high heat. Stir-frying requires higher heat than other types of pan frying. Peanut oil is best for stir-frying, although you can use canola or vegetable oil.  Sear the meat first by adding it to the pan and flipping it after a minute until both sides are browned. Then add your vegetables. Some vegetables-- such as broccoli, baby corn, and carrots-- take longer than others and should be added first. Add in soft vegetables like bok choy or mushrooms at the end., Use a wooden spoon to mix, flip, and stir the ingredients. You want to make sure that everything cooks evenly. If something looks like it is over-cooking, push it up against the cooler sides of the wok so that it does not burn.  Let the sauce steam and cook into the vegetables. Stir well to make sure that everything is coated. There are many types of popular sauce that you can either make or buy, such as:  Soy sauce  Soy ginger sauce  Orange sauce  Hoisin sauce  Black bean sauce  , You can serve it on rice, noodles, or on its own.

"Think about what you want to do and how long it will take. For example, if you need to plan an outfit and shave your beard, you may only need an hour or so. However, if you want to do makeup and style your hair, you will need as much time as you can get. If you’re on a time crunch, try to do some things ahead of time. For example:  Plan your outfit the day before.  Do your hair before you go to work or school.  If you dye your hair, touch up your roots a few days in advance.;  , A large part of looking great is being clean. While you shower, complete any other grooming activities, such as shaving your legs, exfoliating your skin, or touching up your roots with hair dye. Remember to apply deodorant after showering. Other shower grooming activities include:  Conditioning your hair to give it a silky shine  Taking a bath to help you relax for the party  Scrubbing your skin with a loofah to rub away dead skin  , After showering, cover your skin with moisturizer to make your skin glow and repair any damaged skin cells. This step is especially important if you like taking hot showers or if you have recently exfoliated your skin. Additionally, wait thirty minutes after moisturizing to apply any makeup or it may slide off.  If you’ve shaved your legs, moisturize with baby oil to give them a glamorous shine.If your face is oily, use a special moisturizer for acne-prone skin.  For special occasions, consider using a tinted or shimmering moisturizer.  If you have long hair, you may need to blow dry it before styling it. If you have short hair, you can let it air dry. If you don’t know how to style your hair, there are many helpful YouTube videos that will teach you how. Alternatively, if you’re attending an especially formal event, consider getting your hair styled professionally.  To straighten your hair, you will need a blow dryer, a brush, a straightening iron, and soft styling spray.  If you want to curl your hair, you will need curlers or a curling iron and some setting hairspray.  Men can style their hair with pomade or gel for a finished look.  If you’re planning on wearing makeup, apply it after your hair is styled. When doing your makeup, apply the foundation first, seal it with a layer of powder, and then add any enhancements such as blush or mascara. You can also enhance particular features on your face. For example:  To highlight your eyes, wear liquid eyeliner.  If you want to enhance your lips, wear a bold lipstick.  To emphasize smooth skin, wear a high-quality foundation., Everyone looks better with clean nails. If you want to keep it simple, clean the dirt from under your nails with soap and water. Next, trim your nails and file the sharp edge off the ends. If you like using nail polish, choose a bold color that will compliment your makeup and outfit.  You can paint your nails at home or visit a nail salon.  If you’re attending a formal party, the invitation will tell you what attire is appropriate. Additionally, the attire of the party will vary based on the location. For example, if you’re attending an outdoor party, you may need to bring a coat in cold weather. Other examples include:  Bringing a swim suit and a towel to a pool party  Wearing a formal dress to a black-tie event  Choosing nice slacks and a button-up shirt to wear to a business casual event  Wearing a fashionable outfit to a party with friends, Depending on your body type, you may look best in certain kinds of clothing. For example, women with an hourglass figure should wear clothing that cinches in at the waist.  Women with a pear body shape should accentuate their upper bodies with flowing tops.  Men with an inverted triangle body shape should wear tailored clothing that shows off their shoulders.  Women with a rectangle body shape should wear heels and short skirts to accentuate their legs.  The colors in your skin tone will determine what colors you look good wearing. There are three basic skin tone groups: cool, warm, and neutral. First, look at the veins in your arm. If they appear blue, you have a cool skin tone. If they appear green, you have a warm skin tone. If they seem to be some color in between, you may have a neutral skin tone.Cool skin tones can wear cooler toned blue, greens, silver, and purple well.  Warm skin tones look best in earthy colors such as brown, deep yellow, gold, and red.  Neutral skin tones look good in both cool and warm colors.  Studies show that your outfit can affect your emotional state.Therefore, if you want to have a good time at a party, wear something that makes you feel comfortable and attractive. Avoid wearing anything that makes you feel awkward. Otherwise, you may come across as awkward at the party.  For example, if your shirt rides up every few minutes, it may be hard to wear comfortably at a party.  If your shoes hurt when you try them on, they will only get worse once you get to the party. Instead, choose shoes that are comfortable to stand in.  If the dress you’re wearing is cute but makes you feel weird, wear something else. You won’t look comfortable in your own skin if you wear it.  If you’re planning on wearing makeup to the party, bring some extra makeup in a small bag for touch-ups. Touch-ups can include fixing smeared mascara, applying powder, reapplying lipstick. Additionally, if you’re attending a pool party, consider bringing enough makeup to reapply everything after swimming. Common “touch up bags” include:  Makeup removal pads  Powder and a powder brush  Mascara  Blotting papers (to remove excess skin oil), If you eat these foods, you risk ruining your shirt or dress for the rest of the night.

Stain-prone foods include:  Dark berries  Coffee  Dark wine  Pasta sauce, Most people find confidence attractive. The more relaxed you are, the more confident and you will look. If you’re having trouble relaxing at a party, try focusing on different things in your environment. This will draw your attention away from yourself and help you relax. For example:  Think about the color of the furniture.  Examine the pictures on the walls.  Force yourself to focus on a conversation.  ","plan ahead. take a shower. moisturize your skin. fix your hair. apply any makeup. groom your nails. consider the occasion. choose clothing that flatters your body type. dress for your skin tone. choose clothing that makes you feel good. bring emergency cosmetics. avoid foods that stain. relax.

"Most people associate Easter with eggs, from real eggs to chocolate eggs. The decorative ideas are absolutely endless, and part of the fun is decorating your own eggs and then using them as part of the table display. Here are some suggestions:  Decorate your own eggs through dyeing, marking or gluing on embellishments. Arrange in baskets, egg cups, clear glass bowls, beautiful tall glasses or vases, small dishes,  Use open plastic eggs to place a chick inside on a bed of Easter grass. Place on a plate or in decorative items for display.  Arrange eggs on a wreath and place in the center of the table with a floral display placed in the center of the wreath.  ;  , This is a decoration theme that has many possible variations and you'll come up with your own as you experiment with placement. The basics are to find a nest (basket, weave your own, buy craft store versions or find unused real ones that are definitely no longer in use, etc.). The eggs can be real or artificial. If they're artificial, choose colors that match your color theme. If real, dye them or rely on a variety of their natural color differences to make contrast in the display.  Chicks have long been associated with Easter; adding them to the display will automatically suggest Easter. You can purchase fluffy chicks from art and craft stores in various sizes or you can make your own. Ceramic or other figurine chicks can make great instant additions to a table setting. Here are some suggestions for displaying them:  , Bunnies are another animal often associated with Easter. Bunnies can be made from paper, crocheted, knitted, sewn, drawn, sculpted or purchased. There are many ways of introducing a bunny into the display, here are just a few ideas:  , Flowers at Easter time are an absolutely perfect addition to the table setting. They can be fresh or artificial, or a mixture of the two. Commonly used flowers include tulips, daffodils  ,  Place mats can be used to help create the Easter setting theme. They could be as simple as pastel colors or place mats with flowers that you might already own, through to specially made or purchased place mats that contain Easter themes.  Use napkins (serviettes) to evoke the Easter theme. Napkins can be as simple as pastel colored ones or ones with Easter designs printed on them, through to cloth napkins that have been shaped into a bunny or a chick. Another neat way to present a napkin is to choose one in a green color (for grass) and fold it flat, then place an origami bunny atop the napkin. Napkins can also be simply tied around the middle with a ribbon in the color theme you're using.  Use clear bowls and pitchers for all sorts of decorative solutions. Inside clear bowls and pitchers can be slipped bunny and chick figurines, pastel candles, lots of eggs, etc. Let your imagination run wild in how to use the contours of the glass. Another nice idea for evening meals is the placement of floating pastel tea lights in a large clear bowl placed on a bed of Easter grass. The grass will show through the base of the bowl, while the glow of the candles on top will reflect light around the display zone.  Use plates, cups, egg cups and other crockery or dinnerware items that are designed especially for Easter. These can be used for each place setting or simply placed at various points of the table for best effect.  Make an Easter Tree and decorate it with the color theme for your Easter table. Ensure that it is in a topple-proof container such as a large vase in the same color as your Easter theme and place it directly in the center of the table. Everything else should emanate from this centerpiece and link back to its colors and decorations.  You can make a very simple but incredibly stunning display piece by arranging as many tall glasses as will fit around a cake display stand. Fill with water to the same level in each glass. For each glass, insert one tall stemmed spring flower. This is best done in situ because you won't want to be moving this display once it's made up!  , Place Easter grass on the cake stand and firmly sit a bunny or chick figurine in the center on the grass. Place a few strategically positioned dyed eggs around the grass and put the stand in the center of the table. Go one further and place the stand in the middle of an Easter wreath that has eggs on it; if the egg layers reach up the base of the stand, this can be an incredibly effective display piece.  Fill a Mason jar with Easter colored candies (jellybeans, M&Ms, etc.), then a row of peeps and finally top it with flowers. Tie a bow around the middle or around the jar mouth. You'll love how it looks!  ","use eggs. use birds and eggs. use chicks. use bunnies. use flowers. use tableware with easter themes. use an easter tree as a centerpiece on the table. use a cake display stand and turn it into an amazing display centerpiece. again using a cake display stand, make a home for a bunny or a chick. use mason jars.

"These are listed below under 'Things You'll Need'.;  , The font needs to be realistic, one that would appear to come from Hogwarts. You can download such fonts online––just do a quick search for 'Harry Potter font' and see what works for your operating system.  As well, look for a suitable image of the Hogwarts crest. This can also be found using an Internet search, then saving the image to your computer.  If you don't know what to write, find a copy of the first book and copy out the letter or look for a copy of the text online. Use emerald green ink. The letter that came to Harry was written in emerald green ink on parchment paper.  Replace Harry's address with your friend's, and in place of 'the cupboard under the stairs' put a description of their room, such as 'messy, messy room' or 'corner with no windows'.  You can also edit the envelope; it's recommended that you print the crest onto the envelope in the left hand top corner (or print the crest and glue it in place). Then, write your friend's address on the envelope. Make sure it is your best penmanship, or have someone with good handwriting write it. If you know calligraphy, now's the time to use it. Also add Hogwarts return address below the crest (or on the back of the envelope, which is more commonplace in Britain).  If you want, you can make the paper look old before you fold the letter and put it in an envelope. See How to make paper look old or How to age paper using tea for more ideas.  Think of creative ways to deliver the letter. You could slip it in with a bundle of birthday cards, slip it into a friend's locker or have it dangling mid-air in a room.  One creative way is to make an origami owl. (You can find a clever design by searching 'origami owl bookmark' and clicking on the result by Activity TV.) Put the letter in the owl's 'beak', where you would normally put the page. Then you can put the owl in the witch/wizard's desk or backpack, etc.  Another way is, when you go to your friend's house, offer to grab the mail and secretly put the letter in the pile. If you're a good actor, then feign shock when you see the letter, or do an oblivious 'What's this for?' and hand your friend the letter.  You can also just mail it to them using the postal service. It's less magical, but people love getting mail.  ","gather the needed materials. choose a suitable font. start writing the letter. print out the letter. deliver the letter. you now know how to write a harry potter acceptance letter! "
"It should be the consistency of pancake batter. Don't worry if you made it too thin, add more yogurt.;  , You may choose to peel it or not, it is a personal preference. Squeeze as much as the water from the cucumber as you can. Add it to the yogurt mixture. Stir well.  You can also add a small handful of mint finely chopped or generous pinch of dried mint or dill.  About 1 teaspoon of cumin seeds will add texture.

"If you do Pilates in a small, carpeted area, you may be able to get a thinner, narrower mat. If you have more space or a harder floor surface, get a thicker, wider mat.;  , The purpose of the Pilates mat is to help support and cushion your body as you do exercises on it, so it is important not to get a mat that is too thin.  Measure your height and body width to check against a mat's dimensions at the store or when reading product details online. If possible, lie down on the mat to see how it accommodates your body.  Touch the mat if you can to see how it feels and whether it will provide you with a good grip. Find a mat that will prevent you from slipping or sliding as you exercise and may perspire.  This may be important if you do Pilates at a gym or other location where you need to bring your own equipment or simply want to put away your mat after exercising. Consider getting a mat that can be rolled up or carried by a strap.  The extra thickness can give you more support and protection against potential injuries. You may want to have a mat made of foam underneath a thin mat.  Certain mats may be manufactured and marketed for either Pilates or yoga, but you can try using a combination of both types in your Pilates workouts.  This may be an option if you are taking classes at a Pilates studio that provides equipment for their students. By using different mats, if offered, you can decide which ones you prefer.  ","examine your workout space and floor surface. get a mat that is at least 1/2-inch (1.25 cm) thick. buy a mat that is long and wide enough for your body. judge the mat's texture. find a mat that can be easily transported or stored away if necessary. consider using 2 mats. include yoga mats in your selection process. try out pilates mats in a studio. choose a mat's color and/or pattern based on your personal preferences.

"Rub non-iodized salt onto the flesh-side of the hide, roughly an inch thick, and let sit for 24 hours. Remove the old salt and repeat the process with new salt. In a cool dark place, let the hide dry. Watch carefully to make sure it doesn't get too hard to mold, however.When it's toughened up, hydrate the skin using cool water, a small capful of Lysol disinfectant, and table salt. Soak the skin in this mixture overnight and rinse several times until the salt mixture is removed. Hang skin up to drain, and towel dry when its stopped dripping. You can consider using pickling agent at this point to treat the hide farther, but make sure you take care to remove any more bits of flesh or fat that are clinging to the hide before you move on to tanning it.  Treat the hide with tanning oil. Heat up the oil a bit in the microwave and rub it into the skin with your hands. Let the skin sit for several hours and roll the skin up in a plastic bag, keeping it in the refrigerator until you're ready to mount it on the form.  Soak the skin in a 50/50 mix of glycerin and alcohol for up to two weeks.Keep in a cool and dark place. When you remove the skin, pat it dry and remove any glycerin from the inside.  Place the skin flesh-side down on a generous coating of borax inside a shoebox. Sprinkle about a 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) more borax on top of the feathers. Leave in a cool, dark, and dry location for about 4 days. The flesh will be quite stiff after you remove from the borax. Brush off the excess and your bird or fish skin will be preserved nicely.  ","tan the skin of mammals. use an alcohol mixture to preserve reptile skin. for bird and fish preservation, rub borax on the inside of the skin. "
"Non sequitur is Latin for 'does not follow' and describes a speaker's failure to construct an argument in a logical manner. This phrase has been used since the time of the Caesars. Today, the word 'random' is used in basically this way, referring to the use of non sequitur for comedy.  The word 'random' really refers to a process or a decision made without a conscious or systematic choice. True randomness is unplanned, making it somewhat difficult to provide a concrete strategy for 'being random.'  Strictly speaking, a person is not random. A phrase or an action can seem spontaneous or unexpected, but one person is not more or less 'random' than another. You can, however, learn to be wacky and spontaneous in the way that people mean when they say 'random.';  , It will sound more random, or like you've got some kind of head injury. For example, instead of saying, 'A few years ago,' be more specific and say, 'A few years after the year before ten years ago, I was speaking to the brother of my sister's father (uncle).' Take your figures of speech to extremes.  Start thinking of the most obscure, inane, and spectacularly random details under the sun and committing them to memory. The more you've got rattling around in your noggin', the more random you'll be able to be.  Don't use regular colors, like 'blue,' use 'eggshell,' or 'dioxane violet.' Look through Liquitex paint names for ideas; my favorite of theirs is 'hookers green' in your writing and your speech. And yes, those are real colors.  The next time someone asks you to pick a number between one and ten, answer with something like 'pi', 'e', or 'the square root of seven.'  , 'Wandom' means 'wannabe random,' and it can be extremely heartbreaking that someone would feel the need to invent this term. This is usually formerly random material that has been overused and is just not random anymore. Strictly speaking, anything that you've used for joke purposes before can only be 'random' once.  Wandom words include pickle, chicken, monkey, dino, penguin, purple, pie, squirrel, moo, pizza, mayonnaise, pudding, pants, rawr, socks, pony, llama, unicorn, taco (or burrito), cheese, and nose. Of course, the randomness is fairly culturally specific to North American school culture, so feel free to ignore this step. Use random words as you see them.  Third person means replacing 'I' with your full name. This is common to the ego-obsessed and many professional wrestlers.  If you want to take it even further, when you're speaking about the group you're in by using random alternative group concepts. Instead of saying 'we,' say 'our company,' 'our army,' 'the movement.' Keep switching between normal speaking and these methods, and also constantly changing the replacements themselves for maximum efficacy.  Things like 'mwargh' or 'oooooohh' or even 'bwah' and 'digee' will work divinely. You could also laugh. A lot and randomly. People will know you for it. Sometimes, you can be the person who laughs and makes everyone else join in! Don't try for this, though. You have to kind of be in your own world first.  ","use non sequiturs. be oddly specific with what you are saying. learn very specific facts and recite them regularly. avoid 'wandom' words. speak about yourself in the third person. make random noises.

"Cholesterol is a fatty substance which is essential ingredient of the body used in various metabolic activities of the body. However, when it exceeds the normal limits (150-200 mg/dL blood), it poses a serious threat to the arteries and heart. It can be successfully regulated and treated by means of slight changes in your diet.  Cholesterol can't dissolve in the blood. It has to be transported to and from the cells by carriers called lipoproteins. Low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, is known as 'bad' cholesterol. High-density lipoprotein, or HDL, is known as 'good' cholesterol. These two types of lipids, along with triglycerides and Lp(a) cholesterol, make up your total cholesterol count, which can be determined through a blood test., He or she should be your first opinion. They will be able to tell you what's a good number for you. Your family history and lifestyle will factor into their conclusion. What's more, they can help you stick to a plan.  Ask them what physical exercise and diet regimen you should be starting. They can help by giving you ideas and telling you the do's and don'ts of maintaining low cholesterol.  For each person it's different -- so what's your ideal number? Your doctor will probably ask you a few questions to find out what's right for you. It all depends on your family history, your weight, blood pressure, and lifestyle habits (like smoking and drinking).For high-risk patients, a target LDL of less than 70 will likely be advised. If you fall into the moderate category, under 130 may be your number. And if you're one of the lucky ones and your risk is low, less than 160 is acceptable. Whatever branch you fall into, it's best to know earlier rather than later., If you smoke, stop. Apart from all the other reasons it's not good for you, it may help to raise your good cholesterol -- the HDL kind. Just 20 minutes after quitting, you'll see a change. Within a day, you're less likely to get a heart attack. If you make it a year, your risk of heart disease gets cut in half. And in 15 years, it's like you never smoked. So, yes, you still have time.A person's risk of heart disease and heart attack greatly increases with the number of cigarettes he or she smokes. People who smoke have a two to four times higher chance of having heart disease. And smokers continue to increase their risk of heart attack the longer they smoke. Women who smoke and also take birth control pills increase several times their risk of heart attack, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease.

"If you suspect that your cat has gone blind or is losing her sight, schedule an appointment with your cat’s veterinarian right away. Some types of blindness are reversible if they are treated right away. For example, if your cat is suffering from blindness caused by hypertension, a daily medication may restore her sight and prevent further health problems as well.Make sure that your cat gets regular check-ups with a veterinarian even if she seems healthy. Early diagnosis and treatment of a problem can prevent your cat from going blind.;  , Sometimes a cat will go blind over a period of days, weeks, or months. After the cat has become mostly or totally blind, you may begin to notice some strange behavior. Observe your cat to determine if she might be blind. Some of the behaviors that blind cats display include:Seeming confused about her surroundings  Bumping into furniture and other objects  Missing jumps or landings that she used to manage with ease  Seeming reluctant to move around or venture outdoors  Rubbing or squinting her eyes  , If your cat’s behavior has you suspicious that she might have gone blind, inspect her eyes to see if they look different than usual. Even if your cat is not showing signs of blindness, you should inspect your cat’s eyes regularly to check for early symptoms of blindness. Some common symptoms of blindness in cats include:Eyes don’t respond to light, pupils are dilated  Eyes look cloudy, inflamed, or discolored  , Since your cat may have a hard time navigating the house at first, you should do your best to provide a home that is as free from obstacles as possible. Keeping the floor clear will help your cat to navigate the house without bumping into things.Some suggestions for how to minimize obstacles in your home include:  Leaving your furniture where it is  Keeping your home clean and clutter-free  Teaching children to pick up their toys after they are finished playing with them  , Since your cat no longer has her sense of sight to determine whether or not something or someone is a threat, she may be more frightened by loud noises than she was before losing her sight. Help your cat to feel calm and safe by avoiding making loud noises and asking others to do the same.If you accidentally make a loud noise, make sure to comfort your cat by petting her and speaking softly to her. Some other suggestions for maintaining a calm environment include:  Getting up slowly from a chair instead of jumping up suddenly  Walking upstairs to speak to someone instead of yelling up to them  Avoiding slamming cupboards and doors  , Since your cat can no longer see you when she enters a room, you might want to develop a habit of humming or chatting to yourself to let her know where you are. Your cat may also feel safer and more relaxed if you hum and chat when you are around her. This will also help prevent startling your cat when you want to pet her. By announcing your presence, she will be less likely to be surprised by the feeling of your hand on her back., If your cat used to go outside before she went blind, stay with your cat as much as you can when she ventures outside. By being present as your cat rediscovers the outdoors, you can rescue her from any mishaps while still allowing her to enjoy being outside.  Try keeping your cat in an enclosed garden when she wants to go outside. This will help minimize the chances that she will get injured or lost.Consider getting a cat harness and leash to prevent your cat from wandering off into danger.  If you are unable to monitor your cat while she is outside, do not let her go out.  If your cat has been diagnosed with a medical condition that requires special treatment, medication, or other interventions, make sure that you follow the veterinarian’s instructions. If your cat’s blindness is related to a medical condition, it will not improve until she is cured. Contact your veterinarian immediately if your cat’s condition worsens or does not improve despite treatment.  Be aware that some forms of blindness are not reversible even with medical interventions. Your cat may remain blind for the rest of her life, but she can still have a happy life., Your cat is still normal. Even though she has gone blind, she will still want to do everything that a cat likes to do, like playing. While buying toys, look for cat toys that are made specifically for blind cats. Also, shift from sight-based games to sound-based ones, such as 'follow-the-noise.' Anything that crinkles, crackles, resounds or can be tapped can serve as a new source of entertainment.

"Hand cleaning is great for spot treating scuff marks and dirt, but it’s also an effective way of deep cleaning leather.Although if your item is expensive or made of hard leather, a professional cleaner might be the safest cleaning method.;  , Pour a small amount of castile soap into a bowl of distilled water.Agitate the solution with your hand or a whisk to distribute the soap and create bubbles.  For even better leather protection, use a soap specially formulated for cleaning leather. These kinds of soaps are available at many general retailers, hardware stores, and craft stores.  If you don’t have castile soap or a specialty leather cleaner, you can use a mild soap, like dish soap, as a substitute.Always test your cleaning solution on an out of sight spot on the leather before using it to clean more visible parts., A normal dishcloth will do if you don’t have better options, but a microfiber cloth will work best. Avoid using any kind of abrasive material, like a scrubbing pad, as these may scratch leather, creating cloudiness in its finish.  Generally speaking, harsh cleaners should be avoided when cleaning leather. These can cause a negative reaction the deforms the leather’s surface.  Follow the grain of the leather with your cloth as you wipe. In areas where there is caked-on dirt or a tough-to-remove spot, rub using a light, circular motion to remove the debris.  Avoid completely saturating the leather with water as you clean, which can damage the leather. You may want to allow the leather to dry a bit if it becomes too wet while cleaning., You should be especially careful to remove all soap when you're done, as it can dry the leather out and cause it to crack. Take a fresh lint-free rag and dampen it with clean water. Wipe all cleaned leather surfaces thoroughly.  Arrange the item as it would rest normally on a hanger or suitable surface (like a chair or drying rack) until it air dries completely. Avoid exposing leather items to direct sunlight, as this can dry out the fabric and cause it to crack.  This last step will restore the leather's smooth texture and keep it protected. Always follow the conditioner’s directions for the best results, but generally, buff conditioner into the fabric with a clean, dry, lint-free cloth.  Over time, oil that keeps leather supple and resilient disappears from the fabric. Cleaning, especially, can leave leather brittle if you don’t replenish these oils with leather conditioner.When cleaning finished leather, avoid products such as mink oil and leather waxes. They can destroy the polish and appearance of finished leather products.

"Before applying for a joint credit card, check the credit of both applicants to see what credit scores each applicant has. You can request your credit report once per year for free from each of three major credit reporting agencies—Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion—by visiting annualcreditreport.com, which is authorized by federal law. The credit report will not include the score, but the information it contains affects your score, which you can purchase separately from one of many companies who can get the score for you. A credit report will show your credit history and a credit score is a calculation of your credit risk. Your score may vary from company to company since it is calculated based on information in your credit report. A lender, moreover, may see a different credit score than you do when they conduct their inquiry.You can call for a free report at 1-877-322-8228.  Credit scores can be obtained for free from such sites as Creditkarma.com.;  , Check to see which applicant has a higher credit score by looking at the credit score you have purchased. The rates you get on a joint credit card might be affected if one applicant has a high credit score while the other has low credit score.Getting a joint credit card if one applicant has a low credit score can help raise that applicant's credit score over time if the bills are paid on time.  Make sure the information is the same on all reports, and, if it is not, notify the reporting agency and request a new report.  There are several different aspects of a credit report. The applicant's information is compared with the information the credit reporting agency has to indicate fraud, the totals of open accounts are collected in a profile summary, lenders are collected in a list, accounts in collections in the past and present are indicated, other credit report inquiries are listed, and any public record information is listed, such as bankruptcy, etc.Review this information for accuracy and contact the credit reporting agency or creditor if you have questions or concerns to try and rectify the problem.  A co-signer does not have access to the credit card itself to use, but may offer his or her own credit to help someone else get credit approval for a credit card. The co-signer agrees to the responsibility of the debt should the account holder be unable to pay, and the account holder's inability to pay bills on time may be reflected on the co-signer's credit report., Authorized user accounts allow a primary account holder to give a person he or she desires access to the use of the card without being responsible for the debt incurred.This type of account may be desirable if the primary account holder wants to be able to remove someone else's account access.  An authorized user may be subject to collections of their specific use of the card, but the legal responsibility is mush less than on a truly joint account.  A joint account is obtained after both applicants' credit scores are considered, and both parties are responsible for the debt and have equal use of the credit card. Both account holders are responsible for the whole of the debt—there is no distinction between account holders by the creditor. On the other hand, both account holders' credit scores benefit from responsible credit practices.  Many banks offer credit cards to their customers, which can qualify those customers for better checking or savings account products in addition to rewards. Non-bank credit cards also offer many rewards, such as frequent flier miles, car discounts, and more.You will find different options with each major credit card, such as Visa and MasterCard.  Different cards provide higher or lower interest rates.  Department stores may also offer joint credit accounts.  The application will ask for basic and specific information for both applicants. Some of this information includes your name and address, phone number, and social security number.

Online applications may require you to check a box indication you have read the terms of service of the offer for which you are applying.

"If there is any way possible to make this work, turn to the pet’s current bedding first. The pet’s scent will create a more inviting, comfortable environment for your pet and increase the likelihood he will want to sleep in his new bed.  Shop for new bedding if the pet’s current bed doesn’t work with the suitcase design. Take measurements of the luggage’s inside before you shop. Hit the pet store first to find bedding that is comfortable but also designed to be laundered.  Another approach is to use an older pillow that you no longer sleep on, cover it with one of your old warm and cozy sweaters (wool or cashmere will be much appreciated) and then stuffed into the suitcase. Your pet will smell your odor and will appreciate the comfy pillow fill and the delicious texture of natural animal fibers. You could also try blankets that have your scent on them. That works as well.  ","try simply transferring the pet’s current bed to the suitcase. "
"It should fit across the inside top of the window opening.  Screw (or otherwise provide for attaching) the 1x1 to the window frame.  You cannot inside-mount on French doors.  ;  , While these can be made with light weight materials, decorator weight is ideal.  'Decorator weight' is a bit heavier -- think the weight of a tablecloth.  Add an inch (2.54 cm) in both height and width to the size of the window opening.  The extra material is for seam allowances.  Outer fabric can be cut a little wider so that it 'wraps' around each side as a margin on the back side of the shade.  Make sure printed or 'right' sides are facing.  You may want to sew fabric tape to the lining fabric to make channels for inserting the battens rather than gluing (as noted in following steps).  Leave several inches open for turning the fabric 'right' side out when done.  Miter (cut off) the seam allowances at the corners so that it will turn cleanly and it won't bunch up in the corner.  If outer fabric is wider to create a margin on the back, sew the sides together.  Hem the bottom by hand and use iron-on hem tape at the top; it will not be seen.  As you iron, take care that the front (or 'focus' fabric) covers the lining fabric at the edges so that the lining fabric does not show.  Sew a strip of Velcro across the top of edge of the material.  This will be used later to attach the fabric to the wood.  Make marks where you want the horizontal pleats/folds to fall.  Glue 'battens' or thin strips of stiffening material horizontally across your fabric at the pleat marks.  Some shade makers will unpick the seams at the sides of the shade fabric and slide the battens between the layers to hide them.  Some batten materials could include: old mini-blinds slats, 1/8 metal rods, furring strips, paneling trip strips, etc.  While you can do without these battens, you may be sadly disappointed in the sag of your shade pleats without them.  This should take around 20 minutes.  Or, as stated above, stitch pockets for the battens to slide into, by sewing parallel lines across the shade at the pleat marks.  Space them evenly in at least two vertical lines.  Most fabric stores will sell a cotton tape with plastic loops already attached for this purpose, saving a step.  Take care to fasten the loops securely to the shade.  They should be twice the height of the window in length.  Tie the cord(s) securely to the bottom loop on each vertical line of loops.  Thread the cords vertically through the sewn-on loops.  Insert a screw-eye bolt to the 1x1 at each point where the vertical lines touch it.  Use either Velcro or staples.  Keep fabric laying flat and run each of the cords through their own screw-eye at the top.  Run all cords through all screw eyes at the top to bring them all over to one side to be used for raising and lowering the shade.  Knot cords together just beyond the last screw-eye and 'train' the fabric to fall in neat folds.  Press with an iron, if desired.  Pull the cord gently and 'train' the fabric to fall in neat folds.  Press with an iron again, if desired.  Battens do the job for you!

"Since you’ll be out during the day, it’s important to protect your skin from any negative sun exposure. And if you don’t like the way sunscreen looks or feels – don’t worry. You have other options.Use a moisturizer with built-in sunscreen.  Use a powder sunscreen. You can easily reapply it throughout the day without ruining your makeup.  The whole point of casual daytime hair and makeup is that it’s simple and quicker to apply than hair and makeup intended for evening. Avoid dramatic makeup trends, like false eyelashes or contouring.If you still want a little more cheekbone action, use a little cream highlighter on your cheekbone.  If you can’t go without the false eyelashes, try going down a step and combining a volumizing mascara with a lengthening mascara.  Use the volumizing mascara at the end of the lashes and the lengthening mascara at the roots.  You’re busy during the day – you don’t have time to rush around touching up your makeup or fixing your hair. Keep experimenting with different makeup routines and hairstyles until you find looks that are easy to execute and that make you feel great.Remember, makeup shouldn’t hide who you are, it should enhance it.  It’s also completely okay to go without makeup. Do what feels comfortable to you.  Do your hair at night so you don't have to style it morning of.  Keep your beauty products organized to help streamline your morning routine.  Look for products that can do more than one thing - search for tints that work on both cheeks and lips and an eye shadow stick that also doubles as a liner.  ","wear sunscreen. keep it simple. find an efficient routine. "

"Use a bandage that is four inches wide for the foot. Start with the wrap rolled up and unwind it as you go. Wrap in a diagonal, criss-cross pattern as follows:Begin wrapping over the top of the foot near the toes. Wrap under the foot to secure the bandage. When wrapping over the foot, you should be moving out towards the outside of your foot. When continuing to wrap under your foot, you should be moving in towards the inside of your foot.Pull the bandage so that is diagonal. It should not be at a 90 degree angle to your foot; instead, wrap at a 30 degree angle. Each time you wrap, reverse the direction of the diagonal to make a criss-cross pattern, not a spiral. Instead, it should look more like a herringbone pattern.  You want to overlap the bandages a bit on either side of the foot to provide the extra support. The herringbone weave should ideally run right up the midline of the foot as you go — this provides pressure and support in all the right places.  Do not wrap the middle of your leg without wrapping your foot.;  , After wrapping over the top of your foot, continue around your heel. Continue wrapping around to the front and over the top of your ankle towards the outside of your foot.The next time around your ankle will make an X on the front of your ankle. Wrap from underneath the inside of your heel, up and across the front to the bottom of your calf on the outside of your leg.  Keep working in a criss-cross pattern over the ankle and above, keeping the herringbone running up the midline as best you can.Wrap less tightly as you go over the calf and even looser at the knee. Take care that the bandage lays flat. If there are wrinkles it will create pressure points and irritate you.When you get to the thigh, you may want to change to using a larger bandage. For adults, you can use a bandage that is six inches wide. For children and small adults, you may simply use another four inch bandage.  If you find it too difficult to wrap in a criss-cross pattern over your calf and thigh, you can wrap those areas using a circular pattern. If you do this, change to wrapping in circles just above your ankle. Each new layer should overlap the previous by 1/3 to 1/2 the width of the bandage.Secure the wrap with a clip when you are finished.  The wrap should be tightest on your foot, looser on your calf, and loosest over your knee and thigh. It should not hurt and you should be able to fit a finger snugly underneath. Examine your toes, if you squeeze them, you should see the blood rapidly return to the tissue as soon as you release them. If your toes show the following signs, the wrap is too tight:Swelling  Lack of color or bluish tinge  Numbness  Tingling  , If you are unsure whether a compression wrap would be beneficial or if you are unsure how to wrap it, see your doctor. Your doctor can advise you on what would be best for your particular injury and how exactly you should apply the wrap. Both strains and sprains can benefit from wrapping.A strain occurs when your muscles or tendons stretch or tear. Tendons attach your muscles to your bones.  A sprain occurs when your ligaments stretch or tear. Ligaments run between bones.  Compression wraps serve multiple purposes for promoting healing. They are best used when you have to stay mobile while you heal your injury. Checking the bandage to make sure it isn't impeding blood flow at least a couple of times a day is useful. They can help by:Reducing pain.  Limiting swelling.  Protecting the injured area.  If you are unsure whether you might have an infection, you should still call the doctor and ask if he or she would like to see you. Signs of an infection include:A wound that gives off a bad odor or leaks pus.  Skin that is hot, swollen, and red, or has red streaks running from the wound site.  A fever.  They are reusable, but they must be kept clean. Read and follow the manufacturer’s instructions. Most types are machine washable.Place them in a hosiery bag so they don’t get tangled in the machine. Use a gentle cycle and a mild soap. If you put them in the dryer use a low setting so that the elastic maintains its stretchiness.  If you do not use a dryer, lay them flat to dry. Do not wring them out or hang them. This will stretch them out.  Some substances may cause the elastic or the fibers of the wrap to degrade. Do not use the following products on your skin when using wraps:Vaseline  Lotions and ointments with petroleum  , Depending upon how much use they get, most wraps will need to be replaced after one or two months.If the wrap is no longer as stretchy as it was when you bought it, this is a sign that it needs to be replaced.  Wraps with tears or holes should also be replaced as this creates an uneven amount of pressure on your skin.  ","start at the foot. wrap in a figure-8 pattern over the ankle. continue wrapping up the leg. check the tightness. apply an ace bandage if you have a muscle or joint injury. watch for signs of improvement. call your doctor if you have an infected wound. wash the wraps after use. protect the wraps from damaging substances. replace the wraps when necessary.

"You may well get mad quite often, but cutting loose with the curse words and name-calling every time something rankles you dilutes the effect of cussing someone out. It also wears you out pretty quickly.  First-time offenders should get off with a dirty look or a few well-chosen words of disapproval. Save the cussing out for repeat offenders. Of course, some first offenses deserve a cussing out, such as when the person who cuts you off in traffic comes within an inch of hitting your car – or actually ‘’does’’ hit it.  Certain places are not conducive to cussing out others, such as the office – certainly ‘’not’’ when your boss is around and definitely not when the person you want to cuss out ‘’is’’ your boss.;  , For a cussing out to be a good cussing out, it has to be understood as a cussing out by the person you’re cussing out. This involves knowing not just the language your target speaks, but something of the culture connected to that language.  Although the British and Americans both speak English, their respective cultures are different enough that certain words have different meanings in each country’s version of the language, including their swear words. “Fanny” in American English is considered an inoffensive alternative to “ass” as a derogatory term for “buttocks,” but in British English it’s just a step removed from the c-word for vagina. Likewise, the British use “tosser” to call someone a person who masturbates, while Americans don’t have a similarly succinct insulting synonym.The French value articulate speech, but can curse with the best of them at the right times. French curse words run roughly the same gamut as American curse words, with “merde” (pronounced “maird,” or “maird-uh” for emphasis) the equivalent of the s-word for excrement and “foutre” or “putain” as equivalents for the f-word.Spanish also has its own equivalents for the s-word (“mierda”) and the f-word (“joder”). There are also equivalents for “mother-f***er,” although one, “puta madre,” can be used to praise as well as to curse, and the other, “La madre que te parió,” is always used to denounce the target.German has cuss words that are linguistically and culturally equivalent to their English counterparts, such as “Arsch” for “ass” and “Depp” and “Trottel” for “idiot.” However, not all words have the same impact: “Scheisse,” the direct equivalent for the s-word, can be casually used by young children.However, one way to insult someone in German can be to use the informal “du” for “you” instead of the formal “Sie” when addressing a relative stranger; a TV personality was once hauled into court for using “du” in addressing a policeman who pulled him over.Similarly, while Gaelic has a direct equivalent for the s-word (cac), that word isn’t hurled as an insult. A typical Irish insult in Gaelic would be “Go n-ithe an t-ochas thú” (“May you be eaten by the itch”), which is an actual curse, not a cussing out. When the Irish need to be more succinct, they cuss in English.Cursing in Jamaica, or tracing, involves trading very personal insults that often include strings of pejorative adjectives about a person’s appearance, escalating to insults about political affiliations, and possibly invoking the names of local criminals to threaten the other party into submission.  As with Brylcreem, “a little dab’ll do ya.” Overusing any swear word will reduce its shock value to the point that no one will take offense to it, including the person you’re insulting by directing it at them. Save the cuss words for when you’re really angry with someone or something.If you need alternative curse words, try using technical terms for body parts instead of the commonly used slang forms, such as “rectum” instead of “a**hole.” Of course, this requires a knowledge of anatomy and the proper words for body parts.  Another way to stretch the useful life of swear words is to reduce the first syllable of the word to the first letter, followed by the remaining syllables, when using the word casually and reserving the full word for when you’re really angry.  Calling someone an “a-hole” would thus signify less indignation than the full word with the two s’s between the first letter and the second syllable.You can breathe new life into old cuss words by using them in new ways, such as calling someone a “douche nut” instead of a “douche bag.” The mixed metaphor can be a great attention getter.You can also borrow made-up swear words, such as the words “frak” and “felgercarb” from ‘’Battlestar Galactica,’’ which are the Colonials’ equivalent of the f-word and the s-word.If need be, you can even make up your own curse words, such as Don Rickles’ famous insult of “hockey puck.” Delivered properly, they’ll get your point across as well as the standard curse words.  When you want to cuss someone out, you want to communicate in no uncertain terms that whatever the person did to you was an unpardonable offense that the offender should feel guilty about for the rest of his or her natural life and several years into the afterlife, as well. There are several ways to make sure your target feels properly ripped into and reamed out:  Yell. A good cursing out deserves as much volume as you can muster. Be sure, however, that you mention exactly what it was the person did to tick you off, several times if need be, as volume alone may not get your point across.  Show your anger in your face. Bulge your eyes, stick your nose out with nostrils flared, and let the blood rush to your face. If you’re red enough with rage, you can make your target red with embarrassment.  Use body language. Get inside your target’s personal space. Lean in as you tear in; it helps if you’re standing and your target is sitting, or if you enjoy a significant height advantage over the target. Don’t attempt this if the target is more physically imposing than you are, however.  ","pick your battles carefully. know the cursing style of the recipient of your wrath and use it. use actual swear words sparingly. deliver the dressing down right. "
"You need to track who accesses a patient’s record. This means that you need to create separate usernames and passwords for each person who has access to patient health information. As part of the audit log, you should track the following:  which record the user accessed  the date it was accessed  whether the user viewed the information, updated it, or deleted it;  , HIPAA also requires that an employee only see the “minimum necessary” information to do their job. For example, a doctor will need to see more health information than a receptionist. Accordingly, you need to create levels of access, in which you provide only as much information as each person needs to do their job.  Some employees might only work with certain patients. In this situation, they should be granted access only to the patient records for the people they work with.  In order to successfully create levels of access, you need to clearly define roles in your organization. This might require that you look at job descriptions and rearrange duties.  Even if you create levels of access, there may be situations where someone needs to access all information in an emergency. For this reason, you should create an “override” which allows the person to retrieve whatever information is necessary to effectively treat patients.  Nevertheless, you should set up your software so that use of this override function undergoes scrutiny.  For example, you could set up the software so that every time someone uses the override function several other people are automatically emailed simultaneously. The software should also track whatever information this person accesses.  You should also write out a review process for each use of the override function. For example, the person who uses it might have to meet later with a supervisor to justify the use.  HIPAA requires that you keep your data secure. In practice, this means that you should use passwords and keep the data secured behind a firewall.  You also need to ensure that your emails are secure. In particular, you must use sufficient encryption technology on your emails.  For more information on making sure your email complies with HIPAA, see Make Email HIPAA Compliant.  You are required to get patients to sign forms authorizing your use of their information for their care. Each form should include a description of what you will use the data for and the date of expiration.  You should track these authorizations, including the date the form was signed and the name of the person signing it.  You should also scan the form and maintain a digital copy.  HIPAA standardized the transmission of billing information. For this reason, whatever billing system you use must support the HIPAA standards.  At this point in time, virtually every billing system on the market does. Nevertheless, you should confirm with your vendor that it is HIPAA compliant.  HIPAA also requires that you maintain your data so that a patient can see it whenever he or she requests it. This means that you must maintain backups of all information. If you keep information on paper, then you need copies stored off-site or digital scans created. If you store data electronically, then it must be backed up.  Ask vendors how they back up their systems. Find out how they ensure the continuity of the system in case of an accident.  Should you host the data system on your own servers, then you will need to find out what backup procedures you have in place, as well as your emergency plans.  Anyone who sees your data must agree to uphold the same policies and procedures as your organization. You should therefore draft a “Business Associate” contract for all vendors to sign.  Health and Human Services has a sample contract available at http://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/covered-entities/sample-business-associate-agreement-provisions/index.html. You can modify it to suit your purposes.  There are also sample contracts on the Internet. For example, the UT Health Science Center has a form contract you can use.You should also have your health care attorney look over any contract to make sure that it is sufficient to protect you.  If you are opening a business, then you will need to purchase software. You also might need to hire someone to host your data on their servers (or to back up your own servers).  Ask other providers what vendors they use. Virtually all healthcare providers are covered by HIPAA, so they should have given considerable thought to whether or not their software is compliant. You should ask for recommendations.  After getting recommendations for different vendors, you need to compare their prices. You should call them to get a quote. Their phone numbers should be on the Internet.  Prices will depend on the number of people who need to access your system, so make sure you have that number available.If your business is growing, then you should think a couple years ahead. For example, if you have five employees but think you will double in size, then make sure you get a quote for how much it costs to have 10 users. You don’t want to switch software after only a year.  HIPAA regulations continue to evolve. You should expect the vendor to keep up with changes in the law. When contacting vendors, you should ask the following:  How does the vendor monitor changes in HIPAA regulations? Does it have an action plan for keeping up with changes in the law? Look for concrete examples. Does the company have a lawyer on staff who monitors changes in the law?  What percentage of the vendor’s clients must be HIPAA compliant? If most of the company’s clients must comply with HIPAA, then you can be sure that it will make necessary changes to comply with HIPAA—or else it will go out of business.  You must comply with HIPAA if your organization transmits any billing information electronically to any health insurance company, including Medicaid and Medicare. The information can include invoices or other information needed to find insurance coverage. Generally, HIPAA regulates providers of the following:  therapy  counseling  medical care  any other service which bills insurance companies  , HIPAA rules are complicated and difficult to understand. In order to make sure that you are in compliance, you should hire a health care attorney for your organization. A health care attorney can help address risk management and regulatory issues.You can keep this person “on retainer,” which means that you pay a fee each month. In exchange, the lawyer is always available to answer your questions.You can get recommendations for a health care lawyer by asking other health care providers who they use. If you don’t get any recommendations, then you can visit your state’s bar association, which should run a referral program. Ask for a referral for a health care attorney.  Be sure to ask the lawyer about his or her experience. You will want someone who has extensive experience in regulatory compliance, not simply in representing businesses in lawsuits.  Technically, you don’t need to create usernames, levels of access, or even have software in your organization. Instead, HIPAA only requires that you take “reasonable steps” and disclose only the “minimum necessary” information. Nevertheless, as a practical matter, you need to create the procedures for accessing and distributing information described above if you plan to run a modern office using computers and email. These procedures will help protect you from unauthorized disclosures of patient information.  The penalties for violating HIPAA can be severe. You can face up to a $50,000 fine for each violation, up to a maximum of $1.5 million each year. There are also criminal penalties for those who knowingly violate the rules.Accordingly, you are better off following the practices and procedures which are becoming standard in your industry. Experienced health care attorneys and vendors can guide you in the right direction.  ","keep an audit log. create levels of access. create an “emergency override” function. secure your data. scan patient authorization forms. confirm that your billing system is compliant. ask vendors about backup. have business associates sign contracts. ask other health care providers. compare prices. find out how the vendor monitors changes in hipaa. check if hipaa applies to you. find a health care attorney. be safe, not sorry.

"A callus is a small spot of hardened, thickened skin that develops from pressure or friction. Most often, they occur on the soles of the feet or on the hands or fingers.Calluses are not contagious, but they can become uncomfortable if they get too large.;  , Corns and calluses are terms that are often used interchangeably. They do share some similarities, but there are also some differences. Technically, corns are areas of hardened skin near a bony area. Corns are usually found on or between the toes. Calluses are not associated with bony areas and usually appear on weight-bearing areas.  Both corns and calluses are caused by friction, such as the foot rubbing on shoes or toes rubbing against each other. Another difference between corns and calluses is that the callus is all thickened skin, but a corn has a hard central core, surrounded by reddened and inflamed tissue.  Corns tend to be painful, while calluses are rarely painful.  If your callus becomes infected, inflamed or painful, you should talk to your doctor. It may require medical treatment.  The simplest thing one can do is to soak the feet in hot water. Take a medium-sized tub and fill it up with warm water, around 45°C (113°F) and while sitting on a chair or stool, immerse your feet in the tub for 15 to 20 minutes while you relax and read a book.  Add Epsom salts for additional skin softening.Soften the hardened skin by adding a half cup of Epsom salts for every gallon of water. Soak the affected area for 10 to 20 minutes.  At the end of this foot spa of sorts, you will find your calluses getting soft. Over a few days of repeating this procedure they will be soft enough for you to just scrape them off with your hand., Castor oil can be used to soften skin and encourage new skin growth. Apply castor oil by massaging it into the callus. Then cover your feet or hands with old cotton socks or old cotton gloves. Castor oil will stain clothing, so be sure to choose something that can get stained. Cotton clothing is preferred because cotton is a natural fiber that will absorb the castor oil, but it will also leave some castor oil on the callus. Leave on for at least 30 minutes.  Squeeze out the Vitamin E and massage it into the callus. Use as many caplets as needed to cover the entire callus.  Leave the Vitamin E on the callus for at least 30 minutes.  Aspirin contains salicylic acid, which helps treat calluses. Make a paste by crushing six uncoated aspirin tablets in a bowl. Add a half-teaspoon of either apple cider vinegar or lemon juice to make a paste. Apply the mixture onto the callus. Wrap the affected area in a warm towel and leave it on for 10 to 15 minutes., Pumice is an extremely porous rock that forms during volcanic eruptions. It can be used to gently rub off (exfoliate) the thickened skin of a callus. Once the callused area is softened, you’ll use a pumice stone to rub off the top layers of the callus.  Pumice stones are readily available at drug stores and grocery stores.  Use one of the softening methods to get your callused area ready. Moisturize by leaving on castor oil or Vitamin E for at least 30 minutes, or you can leave on one of these treatments overnight.  Use the pumice after the moisturizing step to make it easier to gently remove the thickened skin. When your skin is softened, you won’t need to rub too hard. Use gentle, firm, single direction strokes, such as those similar to how you would file your nails or play a violin. With a steady hand and constant, minimal pressure, rub off the top layer of the calluses to bring about healthy skin from underneath.  Always remember that the callus is your body’s response to increased pressure and friction. Rubbing too hard may result in more callus formation.  Be patient with the process of removing the callus. Use the pumice every day to remove a fraction of the callus. This may take a while, but will pay off in the long run.  If after one to two weeks, the callus is still present, call your physician for advice. The callus may require a medical procedure such as:Surgical trimming  The use of urea (a cleaning agent that helps loosen skin) to soften and remove the skin cells  Orthotics to minimize pressure and/or friction  More extensive surgery  , Although the skin on a callus is hardened, you should remove the skin by rubbing it away. Do not try cutting or shaving the area. This can cause infections and laceration injuries. You can easily cut too deeply or at the wrong angle. You may require medical attention if you do this., Monitor your skin for changes that might indicate a callus is forming. If you can’t reach or see your feet, ask someone to help you. You can visit a doctor or podiatrist for a foot examination., If you are developing a callus from playing a guitar, for example, you can stop doing that activity. It may not be feasible to stop the activity, however. For example, if you have a callus on your finger from using a pen for writing, you may not be able to eliminate this activity from your daily routine.  Many people develop calluses on their feet when their shoes don’t fit. Since calluses are the skin’s response to pressure or friction, you need to remove the source of the pressure or friction.  Get your feet measured. As you age, your feet will change size and shape, so it’s important to keep your shoe size current.Try on shoes before you buy them. Sometimes, the fit will be different depending on the manufacturer, so pay attention to how the shoe feels on your foot, not the size marked on the box.  Make sure there is about ½ inch between your toe and the tip of the shoe.  Don’t buy shoes expecting them to stretch as you wear them. If they are too tight when you buy them, then go up a size.  Wear gloves, socks and properly fitting shoes to protect your skin from calluses. Don’t walk around barefoot, as this increases the potential for callus formation., Using these lotions on your feet and hands before you wear your shoes or gloves to reduce friction can greatly alleviate your callus pain.  Alternatively, consider slathering them in petroleum jelly. Moisture will never be a problem again!  , These or the donut shaped footpads specifically recommended for calluses are fantastic as they keep the callused area raised and cushioned, hence reducing friction by avoiding contact with footwear. They won't get rid of existing calluses, but they will prevent new ones from forming.You can also make a foot pad out of moleskins by cutting two moon-shaped pieces and arranging them around your callus.  ","recognize what a callus looks like. know the difference between a callus and a corn. contact your physician if your callus is painful. soak the callus in hot water. massage castor oil into the callus. cover the callus in vitamin e. take a caplet of vitamin e containing 400iu and use a needle to poke a hole in the caplet. make an aspirin paste. purchase a pumice stone. moisturize the callused area. rub the pumice on the callused area. repeat this process every day. talk to your doctor if the callus won’t go away. don’t try to cut or shave the callus. examine your skin regularly for calluses. stop the activity that’s causing the callus. get shoes that fit properly. protect your skin from calluses. use moisturizing foot and hand creams. use orthopedic shoe inserts.

"Stairs are a great option for cats who find it uncomfortable to jump high but otherwise get around well. Cats like to hide illness, so you will need to watch attentively. If your cat suddenly starts to avoid high perches that it had once loved, then it might be time for stairs.Your cat might have a problem if it has begun to avoid its cat tree. Also consider stairs if it has begun to sleep on the ground. Most cats prefer to sleep in a high perch.;  , Stairs take up less space than ramps. They have a steeper incline and thus are not as long. If your cat can manage stairs, it might be the more convenient option than a ramp., Each individual step should be no more than 7 ½” or 19 cm tall. This should be a comfortable height for your cat to climb. A steeper incline could make it hard for your cat to use the stairs., Your cat likes to have space to maneuver on the step. Be sure that the steps are each at least 10” (25 cm) deep. Dogs are less interested in this space, so stairs designed for them might not have the depth required for cat stairs., Stairs are great for cats who can’t jump high but can otherwise get around well. When you suspect that your cat is beginning to have trouble even walking around, then it is time to move on to a ramp. It usually helps to get cats accustomed to ramps ahead of time, so consider buying them when your cat first experiences mobility problems.Cats like to hide their ailments, so it might be hard to tell when it begins to have mobility issues. By 15, you cat is likely to have some discomfort walking. Watch for changes in its gait. Look for signs that it is walking less or using less stairs less frequently.  Some cats never take to stairs and will be especially unlikely to use stairs if you introduce them to your cat late in life. If you cat has traditionally avoided stairs or has never had a chance to use them before, a ramp might be a safer bet., A slope of 18 degrees might be necessary for cats with a very severe impairment. For those with only moderate difficulties, something as steep as 26 degrees might be appropriate., Carpet is optimal because it provides traction and prevents your cat from slipping off. However, your cat’s nails can get stuck in carpet that has small loops. Try a non-looping carpet like plush., There should be rails along the side of the stairs that will stop your cat if it begins to fall off. This is especially important if your cat is losing its sight; it might be the only way that it knows where it is going.If your cat loses its vision slowly, it will probably be hard for you to recognize the problem. Your cat will memorize the location of items in the household and act as if nothing has changed. However, it will bump into furniture more often than it used to, especially when you move furniture around. It might also seem more reticent to jump from high spots., The top step of stairs should be no less than 7 1/2” (25 cm) shorter than the surface it leads up to. A ramp should be high enough to be level with the surface.  ","purchase stairs when your cat begins to avoid high places. purchase stairs to conserve space. look for steps no taller than 7 ½”. look for stairs at least 10” deep. purchase a ramp if your cat has trouble walking. purchase a ramp if your cat has never used stairs. get a gentler slope for struggling cats. choose a model with non-looping carpet. buy a model with safety rails. be sure that the model is tall enough.

"Don’t feel the need to follow all of the latest trends. Embrace your own unique appearance and work to refine it over time. Wear clothes that suit your personality and mood. Being comfortable in your own skin will give you more confidence in all of your choices, including being a loner.Most people are aware of the stereotype of the trench coat wearing, troubled loner teen. If you choose to dress this way do so because you enjoy it, not to conform to some image.  No matter how frustrated you become with other people attempting to reach out to you, avoid the desire to head into rude territory. Stay true to your morals and give them minimal time, but not an abrupt brush-off. Most people are extroverts and have no clue how to interpret your loner signals.Some polite ways to exit a conversation include saying, “Okay, well, I have to make my next class,” or, “I’ve got to go now or I’ll be late.”  , Being a loner doesn’t mean you can’t be interesting. In fact, many loners become recognized artists due to their abilities to channel their inner energies outward. Investigate learning a musical instrument on your own. Or, try your hand at another artistic pursuit, such as writing or painting.One of the reasons that Bruce Springsteen started playing music was to find an outlet for his feelings as a high school loner. Just because you are a loner doesn’t mean you are alone in your experiences.It is also possible that you gravitate toward being a loner because you hold potential friends to higher creative standards as a result of your own artistic impulses. Being aware of this can help you to reassess your expectations of others, if you desire., Try your best to not care about the opinions of others, including those of your peers. Focus on your own inner strength and take actions that make you feel comfortable, not the ones that will make you ‘fit in.’ Part of being a confident person is not accepting bullying. Don’t allow anyone to victimize you for your loner status., Search online for the stories of other loners. You will find that many celebrities self-identify as former, or current, loners. Your research will show you that, for most loners, there is nothing unhealthy or unnatural about this affinity. You simply crave privacy.  ","stick with your own fashion style. stay polite. develop some individual hobbies. be confident. choose a few loner idols or mentors. "

"This will ensure that the crossbow is planted in the ground while you pull the string back with cocking ropes. It is important to note that there are a few ways to cock a crossbow. This instructional shows the cocking process with a set of cocking ropes, which is the most common method.;  , This is crucial to correctly pulling back the bowstring. Put the middle of the cocking rope in the groove. This will tighten the cocking rope as you pull on the ropes.  It is very important that one does this step, as this is what creates the tight tension that helps actually pull the bowstring back. All modern crossbows that employ the cocking rope method of cocking have this groove, as depicted here.  Be sure the cocking ropes are on the bowstrings, one on either side of the barrel, with the hooks facing away from you.  For consistency in accuracy, mark the location on the bowstring where you place the cocking hooks with a marker. This will ensure that you put the hooks at the same spot every time, increasing consistency in accuracy. Be sure that the hooks are oriented correctly, with the open side of the hook facing outward.  This will ensure that you are pulling both ends of the rope at the same time  Make sure you pull both cocking ropes at the same time. Failure to do so will cause inconsistency in accuracy, as well as it will be difficult to pull the bowstring back.  Keep pulling until you hear 2-3 clicks. These sharp clicks indicate that your bowstring is cocked and in the ready position. At this point, it is important that you keep your finger off of the trigger, and the safety feature of your crossbow in the 'on' position. This helps to ensure you do not accidentally pull the trigger of your bow.  Place the odd colored fletching, in this case white, down in the barrel groove first. Failure to do so will cause damage to the bow, as the bolt would not be placed, or nocked, against the bowstring correctly.  Most crossbows have a clip that helps to keep the bolt from sliding around.  Make sure, when the crossbow is off of safe, your finger is off of the trigger. This will prevent misfires and accidental discharge of the crossbow.  Place your finger on the trigger, and squeeze the trigger as you exhale.  Be sure to not jerk the crossbow as you squeeze the trigger. This will decrease accuracy. Keep the crossbow aimed at your intended target.  If your crossbow has a scope on it, you may have to adjust the settings on the scope itself. For help with that, make sure you consult your scope's manufacturer.  Place a bit of bowstring wax on the crossbow strings every few shots,m. This will ensure the strings do not dry out, as well as decrease the risk of bowstring breakage. Additionally, regular waxing will add to the life of your crossbow.  ","place your foot in the cocking stirrup. orient your cocking ropes. place middle of bowstring on the groove on top of the bow by the stock. place the rolling cocking hooks on the bowstring, on either side of the barrel. pull the ropes slightly so that the handles are even with each other. pull back in one forceful, fluid motion. place one bolt into the barrel groove. slide the bolt back into the barrel until it is firmly seated against the bowstring. flick the crossbow off of 'safe'. when you are ready, take an athletic stance, and aim down the scope or sights of your crossbow at your intended target. examine your shot placement in your target, and make adjustments to your sites if necessary. maintain your bow.

"Using 200mm x 75mm sleepers, cut 6 lengths 2700mm long and 6 lengths 1500mm long.  Pre-paint the sleeper to minimise leeching of the chemical treatment.  Set the first string of sleepers 100mm into the soil using a 2700mm length on each side and 1500mm length on each end.  Join them using 2 x 125mm bugle head galvanised wood screws at each corner. Make sure they are level with a gauge.  Their external measurement should be 2700mm x 1650mm.  Repeat this for levels 2 and 3 of the wall so that the total depth is 600mm.  Tie the three levels together in each corner using 50mm x 50mm slotted galvanised angle and 30mm button headed galvanised wood screws.  ;  ,  Dig down to the bottom of the wall and rake the soil to remove any sharp objects.  Lay an 1800 mm x 3750 mm piece of heavy duty shade cloth in the bottom of the bed so that it covers the soil and all horizontal and vertical angled joints.  This is to protect the plastic liner from damage during installation.  Place these plastic liners in the bed one at a time making sure the corners are not folded too tightly.  Take great care to avoid potential damage and leaks when the tank is filled with water.  Lay a 50mm slotted irrigation pipe around the inside perimeter of the bed to provide rapid distribution of water in the tank when it is being filled.  Cut the filler tube (700mm long), vertical overflow tube (about 230mm long) and horizontal overflow tube (150mm) from a length of 40mm rigid PVC tube.  Using 3 way couplers, join them into the distribution pipe.  Secure the filler pipe to the bed wall using galvanised saddle clamps and 30mm button head galvanised wood screws (above the overflow point).  Drill a 50mm hole through the bed wall just above the 250mm depth of the water tank.  Fit a 90 deg angle rigid PVC tube to the top of the overflow tube, and then connect the last piece of tube to the other end of the angle. Push this tube though the bed wall to provide an overflow route out of the bed.  Cut down a 40mm PVC cap to form a sleeve.  Put a small piece of UV protected plastic mesh Inside the sleeve, covering the open end of the overflow pipe.  The filter will keep insect pests out of the water tank.  Use crushed volcanic rock (20mm screenings) as a wicking medium.  The rock should be just submerged when the tank water starts to overflow.  Make sure the rocks are level with the water.  The shade cloth should extend about 100 mm up the sides of the bed.  Fill the rest of the bed up to 50 mm from the top with good quality garden soil with plenty of organic matter worked into it.  The shade cloth works by preventing soil from getting into the water tank, while at the same time allowing water to wick upwards out of the tank and into the soil.  Water wicks up to 300 mm from the surface of the water in the tank, maintaining ideal soil conditions for vegetables to grow.  Cut a piece of 230mm x 6mm x 750mm long fibro cement sheet and a 200mm long piece of 200mm x 75mm treated timber sleeper.  Paint the treated sleeper.  Fix the piece of sleeper to the top string of sleepers in the middle of the end wall near the filler tube using 2 x 125mm galvanised bugle head timber screws.  Use a piece of 50mm x 50mm galvanised angle bracket to secure one end of the fibre cement board to the adjacent side of the bed 200mm from the end wall.  Secure the other end to the end of the sleeper stub sticking out from the end wall.  Use galvanised M6 nuts and bolts to secure the board to the angle bracket and 30mm galvanised button head wood screws for the other fixings.  There is about 100mm of soil under the worm farm on top of the water tank for the worms to migrate to and from the growing area of the bed.  Composting worms are used in the worm farm because they tend to stay where the food is.  The earthworms are much more mobile, taking food from the worm farm and distributing it widely in their tunnels throughout the bed.  Use a thick layer of mulch and a small sheet of heavy duty shade cloth over the worm farm to provide protection from too much light and from predators.  Well maintained wicking worm beds use very little water and fertiliser and the soil's uniformly moist conditions rich in bio-activity is an ideal environment for vigorous and healthy plant growth.  For rapid results, chop suitable kitchen and garden waste in an old food processor. Avoid citrus and onion family waste and meat scraps.  This well-chopped mix is easily digested by worms and soil microbes and provides very rapid decomposition.  Cut a 750 mm long piece of 6 mm Tasmanian oak dowel (or equivalent) and glue a table tennis ball to one end using a blob of silicone.  Paint the assembly with hard-wearing line marking paint, and with black painted rings showing the full and empty levels in the tank.  The indicator slides up and down the filler pipe as the water level rises and falls.  Make a guide for the indicator with a 40mm PVC cap and an 7mm hole drilled in the centre.  As well as guiding the level indicator as it slides up and down in the filler pipe, this cap keeps pests (snails, mosquitoes etc) out of the water tank.  Cut the frame timbers from 42mm x 19mm untreated plantation pine.  Cut 2 x 2700 mm lengths, 5 x 1610 mm lengths and 10 x 700 mm lengths.  The 700 mm lengths control the height of the frame, and can be made longer for tall plants.  Paint the frame timbers with water based acrylic paint.  Fit the vertical supports on top of the 2700 mm long top sleepers of the bed at 664.5 mm centres flush with their outer face. Use 50 mm x 50 mm x 40 mm galvanised steel angles and 30 mm galvanised button head wood screws to secure them.  Add a short piece of galvanised steel builders strapping to each corner securing with 30 mm galvanised button head wood screws as shown in the photograph. Use a light hammer to flatten any sharp edges.  This strapping helps stabilise the structure.  Use 2 x 2700mm lengths and 2 x 1610mm lengths of the painted timber.  Clamp each corner (one at a time). Pre-drill for 2 screws and countersink. Screw the corners together using 60mm x 8g galvanised CSK wood screws.  Mark the 2 x 2700 mm longitudinals at 9.5 mm from one end, and then at 670 mm spacings along their length. These are the centres at which the 1610 mm infill rails must be fixed.  Clamp each joint (one at a time). Pre-drill for 2 screws and countersink. Screw the joints together using 40 mm x 10 g galvanised CSK wood screws.  Clamp one of the centre joints. Pre-drill for 2 screws and countersink. Screw the joint together using 60mm x 8g galvanised CSK wood screws.  Note that 2 sets of screws are used in this joint at 90 degrees to each other. Take care to leave adequate space for them to pass without getting to close to each other.  Finish the rest of the joints in the same way, but not the corners.  The corner joints are complex, and there is only room for one screw in each corner to hold the top frame in place. So repeat the above procedure in the corners but for only one screw in each. (See above photo of top corner joint.)  ,  Cut a piece of heavy duty shade cloth 2700 mm long x 900 mm wide.  Fit 9 x 12.5 mm brass plated steel eyelets along each of the 2700 mm sides evenly spaced and centred 30 mm in from the edge.  Eyelets and eyelet swaging tools are usually available from good hardware stores.  Start at the top left corner of the south side of the bed (north side in the northern hemisphere). Screw a 25mm Galvanised Tek screw into the frame 20mm in from the top and left side of the bed.  Leave 10mm of Tek screw thread exposed so that 2 eyelets can be accommodated on the 'hook'.  Repeat the process in the top right hand corner of the frame, but gently stretch the fabric horizontally before locating the Tek Screw, so that the material is not loose on the hooks.  Repeat the process for the bottom corners, this time gently stretching the fabric vertically before locating the Tek screws in the top sleeper of the bed wall.  Screw the rest of the Tek screws in place making sure the fabric is kept taut.  Repeat the whole process for the north side of the bed (south side in the northern hemisphere), but use lighter 21% shading bird and insect netting (VegNet).  Cut a larger piece of the lighter netting 4500mm long x 1750mm wide. This netting covers the top and ends of the frame, and overlaps the other netting. It should be applied last and uses the hooks already in place for the side netting.  Drape the netting over top and ends of the frame making sure the overlap is even between opposite sides of the net. Hook the netting over the Tek screws ensuring it is evenly stretched all round, and mark the places where the eyelets need to be attached.  Remove the netting and fix eyelets at the points marked.  Install the pest exclusion netting sides first, then top and ends.  You will find that some of the Tek screw 'hooks' only accommodate one eyelet and not 2. You can screw these hooks in a bit further so that only 5mm of Tek screw thread is exposed.  Apply a band of self adhesive copper tape continuously around the base of the bed 300mm up from the ground.  This measure is a very effective humane way of deterring these voracious mollusks.

"You’ll need to be able to stay warm if you survive a crash. Even if that is not a consideration, the more of your body is covered during impact, the less likely you are to receive serious injuries or burns. Wear long pants, a long-sleeve t-shirt, and sturdy, comfortable, lace-up shoes.  Loose or elaborate clothing poses a risk, as it can get snagged on obstacles in the close confines of a plane. If you know you’re going to be flying over cold areas, dress appropriately, and consider keeping a jacket on your lap.  Cotton or wool clothing is also preferable as it is less flammable. Wool is preferable to cotton when flying over water, as wool does not lose its insulating properties to the degree cotton does when wet.;  , Although you may want to be comfortable or professional-looking on a flight, sandals or high heels make it hard to move quickly should there be an emergency. High heels are not allowed on the evacuation slides and you can cut your feet and toes on glass or get flammable liquids on or in your sandals if you wear them.  Passengers in the tail of the aircraft have 40% higher survival rates than those in the first few rows, in the event of a crash. Because a quick escape gives you the best chance for survival, it’s best to get seats as close as possible to an exit, on the aisle, and in the back of the plane.  Yes, it's actually statistically safer to fly economy than first-class.Save money and stay safer.  Yes, you may have heard it all before, and you’ll probably never need it, but if you keep your headphones on during the pre-flight instructions or ignore the safety card, you’ll be missing out on information that could be vital in the event of a crash.  Don’t assume you know it all already, either. Every type of airplane has different safety instructions.If you're sitting in an exit row, study the door and make sure you know how to open it if you need to. In normal circumstances the flight attendant will open the door, but if they are dead or injured, you'll need to do it.  Find the exit closest to you, and count the number of seats that it'll take to get to it. If the plane crashes, it could be smoky, loud, or confusing in the cabin afterward. If you need to escape, you might have to feel your way to the exit, which will be a lot easier if you know where it is and how far.  You might even write down the number in pen on your hand, so you'll have a quick reference if you need to.  Every centimeter of slack in your seat belt triples the G-Force you'll experience in the crash, so keep your seat belt properly tightened at all times you're on the aircraft.  Push the belt down as low over your pelvis as possible. You should be able to feel the upper ridge of the pelvis above the upper edge of the belt, which helps to brace you in an emergency much better than your soft stomach.  Leave your belt on, even if you're sleeping. If something happens while you're out, you'll be glad to have the restraints in place.  Try to determine what surface the plane will land on so you can customize your preparations. If you’re going to be landing in water, for example, you’ll want to put your life vest on, though you need to wait to inflate it until you’re out of the plane. If you’re going to be landing in cold weather, you should try to get a blanket or jacket to keep you warm once outside.  Plot out the general course you'll be on ahead of time, so you'll have some idea of where you are when the plane crashes. If you're flying from Iowa to California, you can be fairly certain you won't be landing in the ocean.  Use the time before the crash to find your exit. If the plane is going to crash, you almost always have several minutes to prepare before impact. Use this time to once again review where the exits are.  If you know you’re going to crash, return your seat back to its full upright position and stow away any loose items that could become hazardous, if at all possible. Zip up your jacket and make sure your shoes are tied tightly to your feet. Then assume one of two standard brace positions used for surviving a plane crash and try to remain calm.  In either position, your feet should be flat on the floor and further back than your knees to reduce injuries to your feet and legs, which you will need in order to successfully exit the craft after impact. Place your legs as far under the seat as possible to avoid breaking your shin bones.  If the seat in front of you is close enough to reach, place one hand palm-down on the back of that seat, then cross the other hand palm-down over the first hand. Rest your forehead against your hands. Keep your fingers unlaced.  It's also sometimes recommended that you put your head directly against the seat in front of you and lace your fingers behind your head, tucking your upper arms against the sides of your head to cradle it.Bend forward, if there's no seat in front of you. If you don’t have a seat close in front of you, bend forward and put your chest on your thighs and your head between your knees. Cross your wrists in front of your lower calves, and grab your ankles.  It can be easy to get swept up in the pandemonium immediately preceding and following a crash. Keep a cool head, though, and you’re more likely to get out alive. Remember that even in the worst wrecks, you do have a chance of survival. You’ll need to be able to think methodically and rationally to maximize that chance.  If you inflate it in the plane, when it starts to fill up with water, the life jacket will force you upwards against the cabin roof and it will be very hard to swim back down, leaving you trapped. Instead, hold your breath and swim out, once you're out, inflate it.  You’ve probably heard this on every commercial flight you’ve been on, but it’s worth repeating. If the integrity of the cabin is compromised, you have only about 15 seconds or less to start breathing through your oxygen mask before you are rendered unconscious.  While you may feel an impulse to first help your children or the elderly passenger sitting next to you, you’ll be no good to anyone if you don’t remain conscious. Also, remember that you can put somebody else's oxygen mask on even if they're unconscious. This might help save their life.  Fire and smoke are responsible for the largest percentage of crash fatalities. The smoke in an airplane fire can be very thick and highly toxic, so cover your nose and mouth with a cloth to avoid breathing it in. If possible, moisten the cloth to provide extra protection.  Stay low as you escape, to duck under the level of smoke. It might not seem like a big deal, but passing out due to smoke inhalation is one of the most dangerous things that can happen during this critical period.  According to the National Transportation Safety Board, 68 percent of plane crash deaths are due to post-crash fire, not injuries sustained in the crash itself.It’s critical to get out of the aircraft without delay. If fire or smoke is present, you will generally have less than two minutes to safely exit the plane.  Make sure the exit you choose is safe. Look through the window to determine if there is fire or some other hazard outside of an exit. If there is, try the exit across the plane, or proceed to another set of exits.  Flight attendants undergo rigorous training to make sure they know what to do in the event of a crash. If a flight attendant is able to instruct or assist you, listen closely and cooperate to increase everyone’s chances of survival.  Don’t try to rescue your belongings. It’s common sense, but still some people don’t seem to get it. Leave everything behind. Rescuing your belongings will only slow you down.  If you end up needing to salvage supplies from the plane crash site, worry about that later. Right now, you need to make sure that you get clear of the wreckage and find some safe cover. Get out now.  If you’re stranded in a remote area, the best thing to do usually is to stay close to the aircraft to await rescuers. You don’t want to be too close, though. Fire or explosion can happen at any time after a crash, so put some distance between you and the plane. If the crash is in open-water, swim as far away from the plane wreckage as possible.  While it’s essential to stay calm after a crash, you also need to recognize when you need to act and do so swiftly. Help out people who are struggling and tend to people's wounds using basic first aid available.  Attend to your own wounds if at all possible. Check yourself for cuts and other abrasions, and apply pressure if necessary. Stay in one place to reduce the chance of exacerbating internal injuries.  Negative panic is a strange inability to react assertively and appropriately to the situation. For example, a person may just remain in his or her seat instead of heading toward the exit. Watch out for this in your fellow passengers or traveling companions.  You stand a much higher chance of surviving if you just stay put. Don't wander off and look for help, or try to find something close by. If your plane went down, there will be people on the way quickly, and you want to be there when they arrive. Just stay put.  ","dress comfortably. wear sensible shoes. sit in the tail of the aircraft. read the safety card and listen to the pre-flight safety speech. count the number of seats between your seat and the exit row. keep your seat belt on at all times. assess the situation. prepare your space as much as possible. brace yourself against the seat in front of you. try and remain calm. in the case of a crash in water, put on your life jacket but do not inflate it. put your oxygen mask on before assisting others. protect yourself from smoke. get out of the airplane as quickly as possible. listen to the flight attendants’ post-crash instructions. ditch your stuff. get at least 500 feet (152.4 m) upwind from the wreckage. stay in one place, but pay attention to what needs to happen. wait for rescue.

"Even the most steadfast of souls will waver in an ever-messy environment. If your home, office, car, or work space is overly messy or dirty, it is certainly having an effect on your mental well-being. Take a few minutes to clean up your most unorganized areas, and your mind will breathe a sigh of relief. Tips for reducing clutter are as follows:Toss items that are rarely used and have no value rather than stockpiling them.  Gather as a team (i.e. spouses, families, or roommates) and take on cleaning together. Group effort makes the process go by quicker and with more fun.  Sort through papers and mail and toss or file as needed. Develop a regular schedule of doing this to prevent papers from piling up.  Designate places to store frequently used items so they can be easily retrieved when you need them.  Clean your work space after each work session to prevent clutter from getting out of hand.  It’s hard to feel prepared for the day when you haven’t taken time to get yourself ready. Spend a few extra minutes in the morning to prepare yourself for the day's events. Take an extra long shower, put on your favorite outfit, and go into the day ready to take on anything.  Music has shown to have a very strong effect on mood and mental state. Calm yourself down by listening to your favorite soothing music. Although you may prefer heavy metal or rap, try listening to something a bit softer and slower for the best effects. Keeping music playing in the background while you work, study, or just go about your daily activities is a great way to subconsciously alter your stress levels.  Researchers have found that music can change brain functioning in similar ways as medication. So, regular music really can help to 'cure' stress and anxiety. , That’s right, what you smell can actually alter your stress levels. Scientific studies have linked the scent of lavender and oranges to reduced stress and anxiety levels.Use a lavender scented air freshener in your home, office, or car, or spritz a bit of the essential oil onto your hair and skin before you head out the door in the morning. You can also dab a bit of the essential oil onto your temples to relieve a stress-induced headache., If making little changes isn’t enough to cheer you up, try moving to a completely new place for a bit. If work or studying is too difficult in your office or at home, relocate to a cozy coffee shop or a park. Having a new environment will help you to move your thoughts away from your stressors, and give you a chance to breathe and recover from your anxiety., It's possible the people you talk to are stressors. Don't completely take them out of your life, but try meeting some different folks. They can offer a new perspective on things you never even thought about, or get you involved in new stress-reducing activities.  ","clean up a bit. take a few minutes to get ready. listen to some music. try aromatherapy. change your environment. talk to new people. "
"Your goal is to get your fish's attention, and once you get its attention, reward it with food. If your fish responds to your finger right away, award it with food. If your fish does not respond right away, shake your finger and tap the glass until it does notice.You can consider placing your finger in the fish tank for your fish to follow as well. Some types of fish tend to bite, including Bettas, so do some research on your breed fish before putting your finger in their tank.;  , Move your finger back and forth across the tank, and reward your fish every time time it follows your finger. Getting your fish to come to your finger is the first step, but getting your fish to follow your finger as it moves may be a bit more difficult. Move your finger up and down, from side to side, etc. Do not reward your fish until it follows your finger.  The fastest and most effective way to train your fish is by using food to reward its behavior. With repetition, your fish will learn to associate following your finger with being fed. Once your fish understands that they will be fed for doing what you instruct them to do, you'll be able to teach them a variety of other tricks.If you have pellets, use them for your training instead of regular fish food. If you use pellets for training rather than normal feeding, your fish will view them as a special treat.

"The traditional wakeskate board is made of pressed wood just like a skateboard. Recent interest in the sport has led to more high-tech designs that use a plastic foam core. Wooden boards tend to react more like skateboards and respond well to tricks, whereas composite boards float a little lighter and feel like wakeboards.  Composite boards tend to last longer and are usually more expensive., Board size is always measured in inches, and the size you buy depends on you as a skater. Lighter boards move slower but respond well to tricks, while bigger boards have more buoyancy and speed through the water.  39-41 inches: Riders who weigh 90-170lbs, beginners and intermediates.  42-43 inches: Riders who weigh 150-200lbs, intermediate riders.  44-46 inches: Riders who weigh more than 180lbs, advanced riders., While they have slightly less control than a grip-tape board, foam-topped boards are great for beginners. You can wear shoes with them as well, but many people find it easier to learn barefoot because they can feel the boards movement better., The only issue is that fins make it more difficult to break the surface of the water and get air. Still, fins are good for beginners or those who want to focus on speed and comfortable riding.Many boards come with removable fins, allowing you to adapt your board to your riding style or skill level.  Wakeskaters have a wide variety of shoes to choose from, as most regular athletic shoes will work just fine. Many wakeskaters prefer normal skateboard shoes because they are designed to interact with the surface of the board for grip and stability. Wakeskate specific shoes, however, have drainage channels and quick-drying material for added comfort on the board.Unless you're planning to do tricks, jumps and other stunts you can use regular athletic shoes or skateboarding shoes.  These boards are more forgiving to ride, have added stability, and can be ridden with shoes or barefoot. Talk to the staff at your watersports shop about finding the correct size for you if you have any questions, but know that you do not need a 'perfect' board to get riding. With a little practice and the right board for your weight you will be up in no time.  ","know that boards are made of wood or plastic foam (composite) materials. choose the right size for your weight and skill level. get a foam top board if you want to ride barefoot. get fins on your board for greater stability. invest in a good pair of shoes. get a light, foam-topped board with fins if you are just starting out.

There is a lot to learn about penguins, so you may be surprised at the facts that you learn.;  , You don't have to dress in a full blown penguin costume. Instead, dress in black and white, which are the two colors that are found on all penguins.  While most species of penguins have a black back and a white belly, some species of penguins do have other colors on them, such as orange and yellow. If you'd like, include some of those colors in your outfit for the day.  Most zoos have a penguin exhibit, so you can see the penguins up close, and maybe even learn a bit more about them.

"Briefly, these hints of peril include fast-paced relationships, the man's history, multiple relationships, how he selects his girlfriends, and patterns of behavior.  Resist his pressure to move your relationship too quickly. Dangerous and pathological men usually start a new relationship with an agenda in mind. They want 'instant intimacy' so they can begin victimizing you.  Investigate his past. Find out if he has a criminal history, mental health issues, or a history of domestic/dating violence.  Ask your boyfriend about past relationships. If he chooses to tell you about his past girlfriends, listen closely. The man who does not like being by himself develops a history of multiple relationships so he can be with someone -- anyone!  Look for consistent and enduring patterns of behavior. Dangerous men with pathological disorders behave the same way with each new woman they begin dating  Seek information about your boyfriend's former partners. If he has been with women who are also emotionally unhealthy, listen to your gut and back away.  These types of men have a mental pathology or, if they have not been diagnosed, a therapist should examine and evaluate them.  Watch this man very closely, especially if he is quickly able to discern and meet your needs. The emotional predator rapidly divines your needs and vulnerabilities.  Listen to your radar if you begin to suspect you have met a man who wants you to take care of all his needs. He wants a parent and is willing to use you for your care-giving skills.  Check into his history. Make note of problems such as criminal behavior, undisclosed children or diseases, women you didn't know about, and dangerous habits, addictions or hobbies.  Follow your instincts if you have met a man who is committed but promises he is 'just about' to leave a prior relationship. These men seek out women with poor boundaries.  Pay close attention if you have met the 'Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde' type of man. His negative side comes out when he needs to get back on top in the relationship. He will hit, shame, inflict physical harm, blame, and damage property if it forces you to return to him.  Listen to your instincts if you realize you have met a man who has an addiction of some kind. His addiction does not have to be to drugs or alcohol -- instead, it can be to pornography, thrill seeking, sex, or simply being in a relationship.  Pay attention to your feelings. For example, if you are in a relationship and feel as if you are giving everything and have nothing left to give, you might be involved with a permanent clinger.

"Add 1 cup of bentonite clay, and 1 cup of arrowroot powder in a medium sized bowl.Use a spoon to mix the ingredients together until they are fully combined.  Once the powdered ingredients are mixed, add in 5-10 drops of an essential oil of your choice. Mix the ingredients again to combine the essential oil with the powdered ingredients. The more drops of essential oil you add, the stronger smelling your dry shampoo will be.  This step isn’t mandatory for making a dry shampoo, but it lends a nice fragrance to your homemade product.  Peppermint, lavender, and chamomile are popular choices for essential oil additions to dry shampoos.  Use a funnel to add the dry shampoo into your chosen dry shampoo container. A container that resembles a salt or pepper shaker works best for storing your dry shampoo. However, make sure if you use a salt or pepper shaker, that it is either unused or thoroughly cleaned with soap and water. #*Make sure the container is completely dried before you add in your dry shampoo.  The tiny holes in the cap of a salt or pepper shaker allow for added control when you sprinkle the dry shampoo onto the roots of your hair.

"They are:Planting the next crop straight after one crop is harvested. In this case, the seasonal growth requirements of the first and second crops need to coincide with the planting and harvesting times.  The same crop but planted in a staggered manner. Rather than planting the whole crop at once, it is seeded in stages, so that plants from the crop mature at different weeks.  Intercropping and companion planting. Planting two crops that are not related and don't compete at the same time in the same place, in a pattern.  Same crop but different varieties of it that mature at different times.;  , These systems can be very complex but only if you know what you're doing and really, only if you need to do so for a commercial growing business. For home, keep it simple as suggested in the following steps.  The success of succession gardening relies on knowing the growing times of each crop. Some plants are perennial (all year round in temperate zones) while other plants grow only part of the season, others require the whole season to grow, and some plants can be pushed hard into late autumn and winter. If you have mild winters, you can grow more crops than someone living in a place with harsh, snowed-in winters, so use your seasons wisely according to where you live; with harsher winters, you'll need to be more aware of early-cropping varieties that can be harvested before the frosts set in.  This method should be done using a crop that reaches maturity in mid-summer, so that there is plenty of time to grow a crop that will thrive from mid-summer into autumn/fall.  Harvest the crop and turn over the soil. Any plant material left behind can be incorporated into the soil unless it is diseased or mildewy, in which case it needs to be removed and consideration should be given to solarization of the soil.  Add some fertilizer. This could be well-rotted manure, compost, or whatever usual fertilizer you prefer.  Even up the soil. Use a rake or similar to even it out.  Sprinkle seeds over the soil and pat in according to the instructions for the seed type. Pat down.  Water the seeds. Germination should be fast as this is during the warm summer months. The weeds will also grow well, so be sure to remove them constantly.  This method allows you to retrieve the crop at various stages of maturity. This is great for a continuous garden salad and it's ideal for those running a cafe or restaurant using homegrown foods. It works well for lettuce and other salad vegetables, many herbs, and so forth. Some plants not suitable for this method include peppers and tomatoes; anything that takes a long time to mature won't be such a good stagger crop.  Plant some of the seed initially when its planting season starts.  Two weeks later, plant the next lot of seeds. And repeat this in two week lots.  Thin seedlings as specified for the particular plant.  Enjoy the varied attention that the plants need; you will be dealing with them at different stages, so the work needed in the veggie patch will be varied, and therefore interesting and faster for each task.  Incompatibilities, soil depletion, pathogens, and disease are possibilities when some plants are planted following others, so it is important to know what not to plant. For example, beans should not be followed by onions and garlic, and beans and onions should not be followed by tomatoes.  ","understand the four approaches to succession planting. keep it simple for your own home garden. know which crops grow when. harvest one crop then plant the next one straight away. stagger plantings of the same crop. be aware of which plants should not be planted in the same soil following a harvested crop.

"Try to pick a store that will have several different brands of cribs, in many different price ranges.;  , Some people like having this option, although you usually have to pay extra for a 'conversion kit'. Make sure you consider whether having this option is worth it long term.  Some people like a drop down rail so they can better reach their baby.  Some people like to have the option to convert the bed into a toddler bed (by basically opening up the front so a baby can crawl out).  Then, look on the Internet or in books like 'Baby Bargains' to evaluate whether the crib is of high quality. Things to think about are the wood, the craftsmanship, where it was made, what kind of paint is used on it, etc. Make sure you prioritize what is really important vs. what others think is important.

"Investigate and research the time and amount of work involved with the product or service. Your passion comes across in everything you do, so come across with the enthusiasm or excitement that will interest others.;  , Think about how much money you would make and if it would be enough to live on. If not, just try something else.  Arrange plans and organize your business. This will be helpful in the long run.  Said another way, to a large extent, people buy to eliminate pain. For example, people in New York City will tend to buy comfortable walking shoes during a transit strike; the shoes will prevent or eliminate the pain caused by walking a long way. For what you plan to sell, list all of the 'pains' that your product/service can eliminate.  How can you get to them? Face-to-face, on the phone, through e-mail or a Web site?

"Before going into a discussion about divorce with your spouse, be clear on what you want to say. Be clear with what you want and why you want it before talking to your spouse. The decision will affect your lifestyle, economics, your children’s lives, and marital investment. Consider these things carefully before talking this over with your spouse.Ask yourself, “What are my options, and what are the positives and negatives of each option?”Ask yourself about the emotional impact of the divorce. Some questions to consider include, “What do I want? What are the reasons this divorce is in my best interest? How will this affect the family?”  Think about logistics as well. Ask, “Where will I live? How will I manage my finances? What will we do with the kids?”;  , There’s no way to know if you’re making the “right” decision in asking for a divorce. You may doubt yourself that you are being too hasty, or not considering all of the factors. Unfortunately, it’s impossible to know for sure which decision is best.Don’t rush into a decision. Instead, note your feelings and see how they change over time. If you remain steadfast in your assertion to want a divorce, trust that feeling. If you go back and forth on the decision, give it some time or perhaps talk to a friend.  It’s okay to ask for outside opinions, but notice if you start asking for more and more reassurance from others. Remember that it’s your decision to make.Ask yourself, “Is this decision emotionally driven?” If so, wait a few days to see how you feel. Make the decision as rationally as possible.  Your spouse may be aware that you are unhappy, or be completely surprised by your request for a divorce. The more you take your spouse by surprise, the harder it may be for him or her to accept the divorce.If you think your spouse will be shocked, don’t be surprised if he or she tries to talk you out of it.  Especially if you’re feeling unsure about your marriage, talk about the problems first before discussing divorce. Don’t hold your problems in or expect your spouse to know what you want or need.  Choose a time to talk that is quiet and allows for discussion. When planning a time to talk, ensure that neither of you have to run off for an obligation. If you have kids, make sure they are out of the house. Choose a time when you are both home and can talk without distraction., Telling your spouse you want a divorce is not a conversation you expect to go smoothly or one that you will enjoy. Chances are, this will be a very uncomfortable discussion that will make you feel uneasy throughout. Accept the discomfort and know that it will feel this way.Feeling uncomfortable isn’t a valid reason to delay telling your spouse you want a divorce.  Take some deep breaths to calm your body and your mind. Especially if you start to feel tense, deep breathing can relax you., He or she may express anger and ask you why you would do this to him or her or the kids. Your spouse may accuse you of being selfish or of all kinds of terrible things. Or, your spouse may express sadness, cry, and feel abandoned. On the contrary, your spouse may also feel relieved if he or she feels the same way. Expect that your spouse will have an emotional response.  Prior to the discussion, prepare yourself for these emotions, and ask yourself how you will handle them.  If your spouse is emotionally reactive, don’t respond with more reactivity. Practice active listening instead by intently listening to your spouse talk without interruption and without planning what you’re going to say next.If you have problems managing your emotions, check out How to Be Less Emotional.  Before you have the discussion, tell yourself not to get pulled in to discussions about fault, blame, or wrongdoing. These are irrelevant at this point. Talking about the past will not solve any problems but may more likely add to them. Instead, take responsibility for your actions and take ownership of your feelings. Refuse to discuss these issues and instead focus on clearly communicating your needs regarding the future.  Agree that both of your actions have contributed to the demise of the marriage. No one person is at fault.  Avoid blame speech by using “I” statements and not “you” statements.For instance, there’s a difference between saying, “You let me down too many times” and, “I feel abandoned and forgotten by you.” Keep the focus on you and your own feelings.  If you think the discussion may turn into blaming or fault-finding, find a way to deter this beforehand. Say, “This is irrelevant to our divorce and I do not want to get into discussions about blame or fault. It’s best we focus on the the future and how to end this as civilly as possible.”  , If you want a divorce, be firm in this assertion. Don’t hesitate or be wishy-washy. Be firm in saying, “Yes, I want a divorce” and stick to it. If you want something else or are unsure about the divorce, say these needs first. Don’t give unclear signals, as this can be confusing to your spouse. Be clear, even if you know it will hurt your spouse’s feelings.Perhaps you want a separation or for things to change in your marriage. If you want something else, such as therapy or more attention, don’t say you want a divorce first, but ask for these changes first. Say, “I feel like our marriage isn’t working, but I’m not ready to give up yet. Would you consider therapy or a mediator?”  If you are absolutely ready for a divorce, say so clearly. You can say, “This is a difficult conversation to have, but I need to tell you that I want a divorce. I’ve struggled with this for some time, and I suspect you are aware of how difficult this relationship has been. This is something I’ve put considerable time into thinking about, and I believe it is the best decision regarding this marriage. I know this will be painful and difficult for all of us, but I believe we can get through this and be decent, reasonable, and mature from this point forward.”, Don’t monopolize the discussion. Allow your spouse the space to speak his or her mind and feelings. It’s important not to interrupt or cut your spouse off. Allow your spouse to speak openly, and encourage the discussion. Make sure you understand how your spouse feels, and reflect back your understanding.To reflect understanding, say, “I hear you saying that you’re unhappy too, and that although you feel sad, you agree this is the right thing. Is that right?”  , This isn’t the time to blame your spouse or tell them all of the things that have gone wrong or sour between you two. This is simply a discussion of you sharing your feelings and your need for a divorce. While it’s an uncomfortable discussion for you, it’s likely your spouse is uncomfortable, too, and perhaps a bit caught off guard. Treat your spouse with compassion and respect through the entirety of the discussion. Remind yourself that this isn’t easy for your spouse, just as it isn’t easy for you.The way you treat your spouse in the first discussions of divorce can set the tone for how the divorce will continue. Stay calm and empathetic toward your spouse.  If your spouse is angry, say, “I know this is difficult, and I can understand why you feel angry. I feel a lot of emotions, too, yet it’s important we be respectful to one another.”  , In talking about the impending divorce, show that you are willing to be fair and reasonable in the following proceedings. Before filing for divorce, communicate that you want things to be respectful and address everyone’s needs, including your spouse’s.This can help set the tone for the rest of the divorce.  Say, “I don’t want drama to follow us as a result of this divorce.

"This enclosure will be 8 feet by 8 feet in size. You can choose to enlarge this pen, or change the specifications to fit your needs. This will be an enclosure that will comfortably house three or four small to medium size turtles. Use pressure treated wood since it will last longer. You should not use wood that has been treated with arsenic. Timber that is treated with ACQ (Ammoniacal Copper Quat) is good, while CCA (Chromated Copper Arsenate) should be avoided. You can find what the wood has been treated with on a tag that should be stapled to each piece of timber.For this portion of the project, you will need:  8-foot-long landscaping timbers  8-foot-long two-by-fours  3-foot-tall stakes.  2-foot-long two-by-two lumber  A box of nails for wood  Hammer  Measuring tape  Shovel  8 foot by 8 foot section of wire mesh  , Clear any debris out of the area so you have a clean space to work. Use a measuring tape and some wooden stakes to mark out the area. This will be a square shaped pen.  You need to dig a trench so you can put the walls down into the ground. Turtles are skilled diggers and can easily escape the enclosure if the walls are not deep enough., With your trench dug, you will place one 8-foot-long landscaping timber into the each eight-foot long ditch. This will create a square shape, and the first part of your support wall. You will use the 2-foot-long two-by-two pieces of lumber to attach the walls at the corners.  Use the hammer to nail each corner together. The four corners should meet and be secure.  Now that you have the corner supports attached, they will be significantly taller than the 8-foot-long landscaping timbers which are only a few inches tall when they are laid in the trenches. Using the 8-foot-long two-by-fours you will add height to the walls by nailing a two-by-four along each side to the two-by-two stakes. This will stack the timbers on top of each other and give height to the wall.  You can make the wall as tall as you’d like. The minimum height should be twice as high as the adult length of a turtle. So if you have turtles that reach 10” once they are mature, your wall should be at least 20” high. This ensures that your turtles can’t crawl over the walls and escape.  Turtles don’t fully grasp the concept of walls and when they are able to see out of the enclosure, like through wire mesh, they may spend their time pushing against the barrier, hoping to escape. A wooden barrier, at least as tall as the turtle’s height, prevents this problem., An outdoor enclosure needs to let sunlight in but not any predators hoping to grab your turtle. Wire mesh is a good barrier since it allows sunlight and rain to fall through while still offering protection.nail the wire mesh directly to the top of the enclosure, but be sure to leave a corner accessible so you can put food and water into the enclosure.  You can also build a removable top to the enclosure, but this will take more time and additional materials.  ","gather materials. clear and mark the area. dig a trench at least one foot deep around the perimeter. lay out the base timbers and attach corner supports. add height to the walls. use wire mesh to cover the enclosure.

"In strict, traditional terms, a semi-formal dress code requires men to wear black tie (that is, a tuxedo, or dinner jacket, as it is called in the United Kingdom). The term 'semi-formal' arose to distinguish black tie from white tie, which is worn only to the most formal of events. However, it is worth bearing in mind that many people are unaware of the distinctions between 'formal', 'semi-formal' or 'casual' dress codes, and interpret them in various ways. Therefore, it is crucial to find out what is meant by a particular dress code before choosing what to wear.  Traditional semi-formal attire consists of a dress shirt, tuxedo (or dinner jacket, as it is called in the United Kingdom), a black tie or bowtie, and black shoes. The dress shirt will typically have a winged, detachable collar (though standard collars are becoming more prevalent), and studs will be used instead of buttons. The black shoes can be plain oxfords or, more traditionally, opera pumps.  Ensure that the cloth of your bowtie, cummerbund and jacket collar match. Wear a well-pressed shirt, wear black socks and never wear black tie during the day.  ","double check whether the host is using a very strict interpretation of 'semi-formal.', know what to wear for a strict interpretation. pay attention to your details for a strict semi-formal look. "
"You can choose any, from Zeus all the way to Priapus. Find out all you can about the demigod. Just keep in mind which ones are famous for not having demigod kids (ex. Hera or Artemis).;  , Maybe Persephone's children can be born from a flower or Hestia's are born from ashes. The possibilities are endless and you can keep adding to and designing your character for as long as you like.  Work out when they were born, how they got to Camp Half Blood or Camp Jupiter. It's important to understand them completely, including all their flaws and relationships.  This includes sketching out how they look, what they wear and particular facial expressions. This allows you to picture the character better. Moreover, if you're adding them into a story, it'll be easier to explain how they look.  Each demigod has a worst enemy equivalent, such as Luke, Kronos, and even Gaia, so start gather up the characters and work out which one would be their worst enemy. This enemy could also shape your character, maybe they caused a wound or killed someone they loved. This adds effect and makes your character more interesting.  Every demigod has a weapon, even if it's a saucepan. Maybe their weapon is cursed or used to be used by a famous hero (for example, Hercules). Their weapon doesn't have to be enchanted at all, maybe they just use their powers, such as water, or whatever powers they have that are related to their godly parent. Then again, it could just be a knife that doesn't need to be enchanted.  Hades' children don't have to be all gloomy; try making them happy, this way your character is different from the others. Sometimes making them like their parents is useful though, such as using Hermes' craziness or Hecate's weirdness.  Keep in mind what is in actual Greek or Roman mythology, and what it in the books.

"Highly qualified employees want to work for a company that is interesting and exciting. The best candidates will pass right over a boring or poorly written job description. Your job description should catch potential employees' attention by presenting a killer description of your company's mission and the vital role you seek to fill.  Write what makes your company special and better than its competitors.  Write about your company's main goal. Make it sound important, whether you aim to save endangered animals or make the very best toothpaste on the market.  Potential employees are going to want to get a feel for what it would be like to work for you. Air your company's true personality to attract candidates who will be a good fit. The language and content of your description should give readers a sense of what you're all about.  If your company is prestigious and formal, use serious, painstakingly correct language.  If your company is playful and innovative, feel free to use slang or jokes to let people know that having a big personality is part of the job.  Start by listing the title and the key background requirements, which will hopefully weed out people who are under qualified and prevent them from swamping you with applications. Include detailed information about what the job entails, including general and specific responsibilities.  Make the job sound great, but be honest about the not-so-glamourous aspects of the work. For example, if you're hiring an office manager, you might want candidates to be prepared to run the office at a high level while also being willing to order supplies and keep the office looking nice. People who aren't interested in the less engaging work of being an office manager will know not to apply.  Don't go overboard listing more than 5 or so background, field and educational requirements. If you get too specific, you might weed out great candidates who can quickly pick up on how to do the job even if they haven't had the exact experience you're looking for. A person's work ethic and attitude can be just as important to their success as other skills or qualifications.  Ask for a resume and cover letter as well as any other materials you might want, like a writing sample. Include your contact information and instructions for how to submit the materials. You might want to specify how you want the documents formatted and whether you prefer they be sent over email, fax, as an attachment, etc.  The way a candidate submits his or her application can be telling. If someone has trouble following basic instructions, you might not want to hire them.  The benefit of posting your opening in public spaces is that you're sure to get a ton of applicants. The drawback is that you're sure to get a ton of applicants. You'll have a lot of resumes to sift through no matter what, so choose where you post the job opening wisely. Target job sites that draw people who are likely to be qualified for the position, rather than posting randomly in places that will be viewed by people who aren't qualified.Post the opening on your company website, on a page labeled 'Careers' or 'Jobs.' This will draw applicants who actually took the time to check out your company, rather than stumbling on a posting in a public forum.  Post the opening in industry forums and relevant job sites. For example, if you're in the film industry, post the job opening on industry sites that will be frequently viewed by people who are already in the know.  Post the opening on general job sites if you want a lot of applicants. If you're hoping to get as many applications as possible, post on Craigslist, Monster.com and similar massive job sites. Beware that you'll be likely to get some spammy replies.  Big companies might take out advertisements in trade magazines or websites to attract candidates in a bold, flashy way. In fact, advertising jobs on billboards is becoming trendy among the most competitive companies., When the applications start pouring in, it's time to hire the best person for the job. Look for applications from candidates that demonstrate the experience, skills, and personality you're seeking, and select a manageable number of people to interview. From there you'll be able to make a well-informed decision about who to hire for the position.  If you find your posting isn't recruiting the right kind of people for the job, go back and tweak it.  Be patient and go through as many application and interviews as necessary to find someone you're confident will do a good job. It's easy to get overwhelmed during the hiring process, but your hard work will pay off in the end.

"Some growers use pheromone traps to monitor the population. If your traps catch 20 to 30 moths a night for 3 to 5 nights in a row, begin your weekly checks.  Check high-risk areas first if you are a high-volume grower. Check late-planted corn, fields that are flowering or have young pots, and those growing on elevated areas of the land. Corn grown on elevated areas or knolls is more vulnerable to egg laying.;  , They lay eggs on the silk attached to the husks, which gives larvae easy access to the ears.  If you are growing several acres of corn, take at least 1 sample per 4 acres. If you are simply checking a home garden, only 1 sample is necessary.  A 3-foot-long cloth allows you to sample 6 row feet if you check the plants on both sides.  , Check the sheet to see how many worms are on it are at least 3/8-inches long. Worms smaller than that can not do plant damage and may not survive long enough to be a problem.  If you used a 6-foot-row sample, you would divide the number of worms by 6. Your tolerance threshold is determined by row foot count and varies with the specific crop and the percentage of it under attack.  If you are growing a small amount of corn for your own consumption even one per plant may be too many. Many large production growers usually have a higher threshold.  ","check your corn plants for earworms weekly when moth activity in your area has peaked. keep an eye on the silk when it forms to see how many eggs the earworms lay. pick an area to check in several different spots throughout your fields. lay a cloth or sheet of flexible material on the ground between 2 rows of corn. bend each bordering plant over the sheet and beat it vigorously with your hand or a small stick. , count the number of earworms. determine the number of earworms per row foot.

"If you suspect your horse may be lame, you should get him examined by a vet as soon as possible. You do not want your horse to suffer unnecessarily or for the issue to get worse. Your vet will do a basic physical exam of your horse, feeling his feet, limbs, back, and neck to check for any sore spots.Your vet will have your horse walk on a hard flat surface, to start, so they can observe your horse’s gait. The vet will then want the horse top stand in sand or a soft surface, as this may exacerbate minor lameness and make it easier to see.  Your vet may also ask to see the horse move with a rider. This will help the vet assess the degree of the lameness and locate where exactly your horse is experiencing pain. You should therefore bring all your tack (bridle, reins, girth, saddle, and saddle pad) to the appointment, in case the vet asks to see you ride.  You should also provide detailed information on your horse’s symptoms and medical history. This will help the vet come to a diagnosis and get as much information as possible on the state of your horse.You may tell the vet how long you have suspected that something is not quite right with your horse. You should also note any traumatic events in the horse’s life recently or in the past that may have contributed to the lameness. This might include trailer accidents, falls while riding, kicking stall walls, or catching a leg somewhere.  You should tell the vet about any similar lameness the horse has experienced in the past and if the lameness now appears worse after resting the horse or after a training session with the horse.  Once your vet has determined the exact area on your horse that is lame, they will recommend a treatment. Your vet may suggest painkillers for your horse as well as frog supports for your horse’s feet.Your vet may also recommend bed rest for the horse so the horse can recover. This just means confinement to a stall with hand walking, if recommended.  You may need to adjust the horse’s diet during the bed rest so the horse does not become overweight.

"Positive affirmations are when you say something nice about yourself. The goal of affirmations is to change your thinking so that you see yourself in a more positive light.Teaching your child how to use positive affirmations can be a great way to help them think more positively about themselves.  Try teaching your child to say things like, “I love my curly hair!” or “I am looking so cool in my new outfit!” Affirmations should always be in the first person (using 'I').  Model positive affirmations for your child as well. Allow your child to see and hear you saying nice things to yourself to provide them with a model for positive self-talk.  Have your child stand in front of a mirror when they use positive affirmations and make sure that you model this behavior for your child as well.  Encourage your child to use an affirmation every day, such as while they are getting ready in the morning or before heading off to school.  To help support your child’s body image, you should set an example by making healthy choices for your family. Model healthy eating and include physical activity into your life. This helps create healthy habits that lead to a healthy body image.  Encourage your child to choose healthy foods and activities for the family. This helps them be an active part of the family’s healthy living.  For example, cook balanced meals with multiple vegetables, healthy grains, and lean cuts of meat.  Set aside time each week for physical activity. Go for hikes or bike rides on the weekend together, and ask your child to choose physical activities they want to do with the family.  If you are talking negatively about yourself or others, you are not supporting a healthy body image for yourself or your child. Watch what you say around your child so you don’t inadvertently teach them negative habits or bad body image patterns.Talk about yourself in positive terms. Refrain from things like, “I’m so fat” or “I hate everything about myself.”  Don’t talk negatively about others, either. Avoid saying, “She’s let herself go” or “She looks so fat.”  , You can support your child’s body image by using positive language and eliminating certain language from your home. When you talk about other people, don’t use words like “fat” or “skinny,” which can lead to issues with your child’s body image. Focus on healthy instead of skinny, fat, or diets.Talking about people based on their size or looks just teaches your child that looks are the most important thing about a person. It also teaches them to do the same thing to other people and themselves.  Your children will feel more positive about their bodies if they are involved in making the choices. This helps give them some control over their nutrition and teaches them how to make their own healthy choices later.  Take your child with you to the grocery store. Encourage them to choose vegetables, fruits, healthy grains, and lean cuts of meat they like.  Remind your child that they don't have to like every vegetable and fruit. Try new things together to find vegetables and fruits you both like.

"The best course of action is a combination of appealing to your parents’ reasonable side, and appealing to their emotional side. You want to hit them from both angles to make sure your argument is thorough. That shows them how important this is to you.  Most people make decisions based on a combination of reason and emotion. They are interconnected, always influencing each other. That is why you always want to appeal to someone’s reason and emotion when you are trying to influence them.When you plan your strategy, write down how you will approach them reasonably. What kinds of things do your parents typically react to on a logical level? Then, write down the things you can say to them that will affect them emotionally. What are their weaknesses? Do they have a strong sense of pride? Are they quick to avoid fear? These are the kinds of things you should be thinking about.  Keep a close eye on your parents for a while to see what kinds of things they react to, so you have a better idea of what kinds of things you can say, and what topics to avoid.;  , An important part of your strategy is appealing to your parents’ sense of reason. A well-reasoned argument includes persuasive justifications for wearing a thong. Write down five or six logical reasons why you want to wear a thong.Thongs don’t show panty lines. The main benefit of this is that it avoids attention to your butt. Surely your parents can get on board with that.Thongs last longer. Since there is less fabric to deal with, they reshape better than regular panties. If you change shape at all, it is less likely that you will have to buy new panties, saving money.Thongs keep you cooler in hot temperatures. They are lightweight, allowing for better airflow. By avoiding sweat in your panties you will also avoid possible skin rashes or blemishes., Prove to your parents you are a responsible person who makes responsible choices. Doing this will give your argument more credibility. Kick up the responsibility before your argument happens so it does not look obvious.  If you have chores or homework, do them on time without being asked.  Save your money instead of spending it on frivolous things.  Do not stay out late or come home drunk.  Take control of the situation by offering to pay for your thong. This shows them that you have put thought into the decision, rather than being impulsive. This is also an opportunity to show them you have saved your money.  To be convincing you need to have the discussion with your parents full of confidence. One of the best ways to achieve confidence is to practice what you are going to say to your parents, so you are not bumbling over yourself or forgetting your arguments. Imagine that your parents are there with you when you practice.Read your notes out loud in front of a mirror. By the time you sit down with your parents to convince them, you will be well prepared.Be sure you pace yourself and take breaths. You want your practice to be as natural as possible so that your conversation with them does not look rehearsed.Keep practicing until you feel confident you are ready to talk with them in a calm and collected voice. Once you feel comfortable with what you are going to say, you are ready to convince them.  When you are ready to ask your parents to talk, there are a few things to consider. Ask when they seem to be in a good mood. Do not be pushy when you ask, be nice about it. Make sure you choose a time that is good for everyone. Weekends are best, when your parents are less likely to be stressed out., You may not need them because you practiced what you want to say, but you should have them with you in case you forget anything and need to reference to them. You can hide them in your pocket or another discreet place., Open the conversation by letting them know this is something you have considered and want to ask their permission for. Let them know that you want to tell them why, and that they can ask questions after. Try to control the conversation as much as possible. The more you are interrupted, the easier it will be for you to lose your place and forget what to say., One by one, tell your parents all the logical reasons you want to wear a thong and believe they should support you in this decision. Whether it is to hide panty lines, be more comfortable, avoid pimples, or any other number of reasons.  Try to get through your whole list without interruptions, but be polite if they do happen.  If you get resistance, offer to provide them with sources to back up your reasons. This way they know you are not making excuses.  Feel free to wing it if you come up with more reasons while you are talking with them. Do not feel like you have to stick to what you practiced from your notes.  Once you have gone through your logical reasons you can appeal to their emotional side. Studies have shown that emotional arguments can be quite effective. Remind them that you are growing up, old enough to make decisions about how to adorn your own body., They may have questions so be prepared for that. Even if they do not, invite questions from them. Validate and answer every question they have to the best of your ability. Any question you cannot answer, offer to answer after some research or further thought.They might want to know why you are interested in wearing a thong. They may ask you why you feel like you are ready for a thong. They might even ask you why you think they should agree with you.They might ask about boys. What if they see you as a sex object? Why are you trying to flaunt yourself to them? It might be a good idea to have an answer prepared for this just in case., They might not have an answer for you right away. Offer to give them time to talk it over between the two of them and get back to you. This gives them time to ask questions or think about your well-thought out argument.  Do not assume you know what they will say. Prepare yourself for the possibility that they will say “no” or drag the discussion out. It is a good idea to come up with possible solutions to those scenarios, even if they do not happen., Regardless of your parents’ response, it is important that you react in a calm and collected manner. They need to see that you are mature enough to make your own decisions. If they say, “no” now, they may be more likely to say, “yes” to the next decision based on your reaction.If they respond with an immediate “no”, don’t storm off in a huff or raise your voice. Listen to what they have to say, or suggest that they discuss the topic again later. The important thing is that you respond to them with respect. They may still come around.If you feel yourself getting upset, breathe. Check to see if your body is tensing up, and relax your body. If none of that works and everyone is still glaring at each other, tell a joke. Humor is a great way to defuse a tense situation., If they are still not convinced, ask them why. You may be able to address their concerns or counter their objections. If they do not want to talk about it anymore, at least you know the reason for future reference., If your parents will not budge, offer them a compromise. Maybe you can suggest revisiting the topic later after you have shown more responsibility. Perhaps you can agree to get a thong at a certain age. You can ask them what compromise works for them.Find out what your common interests are with them and work from there. You want to be seen as a grown-up, and they want to encourage your maturation, right? That’s a great place to start negotiating.Waiting until everyone is calm will make the process much easier. This is one conversation where you want to avoid dealing with too much emotion. Instead, try to stick to facts and needs. Be honest with them about your goals and offer a compromise that will please them but still get you what you ultimately want.  If all else fails, accept your fate and walk away. Do not continue to beg or harass your parents. Doing that will only diminish any chance of convincing them later, and it will put them in a bad mood. Walking away from the argument with grace allows you to keep your parents’ respect.  ","plan your strategy. know why you want to wear a thong. show them you are responsible. be prepared to pay for your thong. practice your argument. approach your parents about the conversation. bring your notes with you. broach the subject calmly. go through your list of logical reasons. appeal to their emotions. invite questions. give them time to talk it over or think about it. be prepared for any response. react calmly. ask them why if they say no. offer a compromise. drop the subject.

"In the English language there are only two indefinite articles: “a” and “an.” The two words have the exact same meaning. If you say “I want to read an book” or “I want to read a book,” the meaning is exactly the same. However, the first one is not grammatically correct.There are many situations which might require the use of an indefinite article. For example:  If you are referring to something/someone for the first time (such as “I’ve found a good job” or “She has a daughter.”)  When you are naming someone as a part of a specific group (“Jenny is a doctor” or “Robert is an engineer.”)  When referring to something non-specific (“I can come over on a Thursday.”)  When talking about an example of something (“The elephant has a long trunk” or “That is an enormous ball.”)  When talking about a singular object (“I would like an egg” or “I need a pound of flour.”);  , If a word starts with a vowel sound then you should use the indefinite article “an” before it. On the other hand, if a word starts with a consonant sound you should use the indefinite article “a” before it.Generally, this will mean that if the word starts with a vowel you should use “an,” but it is important to remember that this is not true all of the time. This is because the rule is focused on the sound, and not the actual letter that the word starts with.  For example, although “one-day event” begins with a vowel (“O”) you would not say, “an one-day event.” In this case, the first word makes a consonant sound, and you would say, “a one-day event.” If you think about it, the “O” in one does not make an “O” sound, but it actually makes a “W” sound because the word “one” is actually pronounced more like, “won.”  In the alphabet, there are 6 vowels. These include: “A,” “E,” “I,” “O,” “U,” and sometimes “Y.” “Y” is only used as a vowel in some words such as “gym” and “baby,” but acts as a consonant in other words such as “young” and “beyond.” When you pronounce a vowel, the air flows freely through your mouth without having to be interrupted by your tongue or throat to pronounce it.  All the other letters in the alphabet are considered consonants, which means that you have to interrupt the flow of air through your mouth when you pronounce it. For example, you have to use your tongue to say the “L” in “limit,” you use your tongue to stop the flow of air when you pronounce the “H” in “hurt.”, If you are a native English speaker, saying the phrase out loud can help you decide whether you should use “an” or “a.” Usually, when you say it out loud, it will sound strange to you if you have chosen the wrong one.  For example, if you aren’t sure whether to say “a apple” or “an apple” say them both out loud. You will probably realize that “a apple” sounds strange to you, and it may even feel a bit weird to say it that way. Then it becomes clear to you that “an apple” is the right choice.  Even if you are not a native speaker of English, saying the word out loud can be helpful in figuring out whether the word begins with a vowel sound. If the beginning of the word flows freely through your mouth without the need to use your tongue or throat to stop the air, then it is probably a vowel sound. For example, if you say “owl” out loud you will see that the “ow” sound flows very freely and is not stopped at any point.  Many people think that acronyms are an exception to the rule, but they actually work in exactly the same way. If the acronym starts with a vowel sound when you sound it out, then you should use “an.” If it uses a consonant sound you should use “a.”For example, you would say “an FBI agent” because the “F” in “FBI” makes a vowel sound (“eff”). On the other hand, you would not say “an CT scan” because the “C” in “CT” does not make a vowel sound. Instead, you would say “a CT scan.”  , In many American English words, the “H” is silent making the word begin with a vowel sound.For example, in “hour,” “honor,” “herb,” and “heir” the “H” is always silent and the words begin with vowel sounds. Thus, you would say, “an hour,” “an honor,” “an herb,” and “an heir.”  For words like “horse,” “human,” and “humble person” the “H” is not silent so the word makes a consonant sound. Thus, you would say “a horse,” “a human,” and “a humble person.”  , Often, if a word begins with a “U” it doesn’t make a vowel sound so you need to use “a” instead of “an.” This is tricky because “U” is a vowel, but often makes a “Y” sound when used at the beginning of a word.For example, in the word “University” the “U” is a long “U” and sounds like “yew,” which is a consonant sound. Therefore, you would say “a University” not “an University.”  On the other hand the “U” in “Umbrella” really does make a “U” sound, so you would say “an umbrella” not “a umbrella.”  ","understand the role of indefinite articles in the english language. memorize the rule. say the word out loud. don’t forget that acronyms work in the same way. remember that when a letter begins with “h” it may require “an.” words that begin with “h” can be confusing when you’re trying to decide whether to use “a” or “an.” this is when it becomes important to remember that you are looking for a vowel ‘’’sound’’’ not just a letter that is a vowel. remember that “u” doesn’t always make a “u” sound. "
"How much testosterone your body produces has a lot to do with diet, so it's important to become aware of exactly what you're eating. A good testosterone-friendly diet includes plenty of healthy fats, green leafy vegetables, protein and cholesterol (it's not all bad!). Low-fat diets should be avoided when trying to boost testosterone.  For example, minerals such as zinc and magnesium help to get testosterone production started, while a healthy level of cholesterol allows your Leydig cells to actually make testosterone.  In addition, veggies such as broccoli, cauliflower and cabbage work to lower the levels of estrogen (a female hormone) in your body, thus boosting testosterone levels.;  , Incorporating a handful or two of walnuts or almonds into your daily diet is a great, easy way to increase testosterone levels.  Also try branching out to brazil nuts, cashews, peanuts and other nuts high in monounsaturated fats, as men who regularly consume these fats have higher testosterone levels than men who don't.Seeds, such as sunflower and sesame seeds, also provide high levels of monounsaturated fats, in addition to protein, vitamin E and zinc, all of which boost testosterone.  For the healthiest option, go for the unflavored, unsalted versions of nuts and seeds.  Zinc is one of the most important minerals your body needs for the production of testosterone. In fact, increasing your zinc intake can significantly raise testosterone levels in as little as six weeks.If you're looking for a quick fix, six oysters is all the boost your body needs to produce more testosterone, as oysters contain loads of zinc.But if shellfish isn't your thing, you can also increase your zinc intake by eating protein-rich meats and fish, along with raw dairy products such as milk and cheese, all of which contain high levels of zinc.  If you're finding it difficult to increase your zinc intake through diet alone (especially as a vegan or vegetarian) you can help the process along by taking a zinc supplement. The recommended intake for adults is no more than 40 mg per day.  The health benefits of oatmeal are well-known - it is high in fiber and low in fat - but now there is one more reason to start your day with a bowl of oats: a 2012 study has shown that oatmeal is linked with increased levels of testosterone.  The study found evidence that compounds in oats called avenacosides can limit the level of sex-hormone-binding globulins in the system, thus increasing testosterone levels.Oatmeal has also been shown to improve sexual performance. It loaded with L-arginine, an amino acid that reacts with nitric oxide to relax blood vessels. When those blood vessels expand, blood flow is increased mightily.  Eggs are basically a testosterone-producing superfood. Their yolks contain high levels of HDL (a.k.a. the 'good' type of cholesterol) which forms the building blocks of testosterone production.  In addition, eggs are high in protein and loaded with zinc - two more testosterone producing essentials.  Don't worry about your arteries - eating 'good' cholesterol will not raise your blood cholesterol levels (unlike 'bad' cholesterol such as triglycerides) so you can eat up to three whole eggs a day without compromising your health.  Cabbage (along with other leafy green veg such as spinach and kale) can do wonders for your testosterone levels. It contains a phytochemical called indole-3-carbinol (IC3) which has the dual effect of increasing male hormones while decreasing female ones.  Specifically, a study conducted at Rockefeller University Hospital showed that estrogen levels were reduced by up to 50% in men who took 500 mg of IC3 a week, thus making existing testosterone levels much more effective.  The most effective way to increase your IC3 levels at home is to eat plenty of cabbage, so try making cabbage soup, cabbage rolls, cabbage juice, or good old cabbage and potatoes.  Scientists have found that obese men are 2.4 times more likely to have low testosterone than their counterparts, so it's important that you attempt to shed any extra pounds in order to increase testosterone.The fastest way to do this is to cut as much processed sugar from your diet as possible.  If you are an avid soda drinker, that should be the first thing to go. Sodas are filled with processed sugars and empty calories, which lead to insulin resistance and weight gain. Just by cutting your daily can of soda from your diet, you could be eliminating a ton of calories.  Fructose is a type of sugar found in processed foods and fruit juices. It is believed to be one of the major factors behind modern-day obesity. To decrease your fructose intake, cut out processed food and drinks, along with refined carbohydrates found in breakfast cereals, bagels, pretzels, waffles etc. , It's technically a hormone, but a really important one at that. Studies show that people who regularly take D3 supplements actually have higher testosterone levels., While they may be in vogue, they certainly don't help your little helpers produce more T. These are the things you should stay away from:  Vitamin C. Unless you have diabetes, you won't benefit much from taking this supplement to boost your testosterone. While it may be beneficial in boosting T in diabetic rats, that's about the extent of the scientific evidence.You're most likely getting enough vitamin C from your diet.  ZMA. ZMA is a supplement blend of zinc, magnesium, and vitamin B6. Recent studies have found that ZMA has absolutely no effect on the production of testosterone in men.Unless you know you have deficiencies in any one of these categories, steer clear.  Do your research. Research supplements that claim to help raise testosterone levels. If you're unsure, be your own advocate and make an informed decision. Just because it's out there on the internet does not make it true.  If you're hoping to increase your testosterone levels, diet isn't the only thing to consider. Exercise is an equally important part of increasing testosterone levels, which is why you should come up with an effective, yet sustainable fitness plan designed to maximize testosterone production.  Specific types of exercise, such as weightlifting, actually cause the body to produce more testosterone.  Exercising decreases your chances of being overweight and, as discussed above, being overweight can negatively impact testosterone levels.If you're not sure where to begin, it may be a good idea to enlist the services of a personal trainer who can develop an exercise plan specifically tailored to your current fitness level, along with your desired outcome.  If you want to boost testosterone, you should begin to lift weights, as weight-lifting is the most effective form of exercise for increasing testosterone production. However, for best results, you will need to lift heavier weights with fewer repetitions, and it's probably best to avoid the weight machines altogether. Stick with free weights and follow the advice below:  Lift large muscle groups. Studies show that lifting larger muscle groups, which require complex, compound movements, is much more effective for producing testosterone than working just one or two smaller muscles.For this reason, you should stick with weight exercises such as bench presses, squats, deadlifts, and shoulder presses.  Try to work out with high volume. The type of exercises you perform will mean nothing if you don't have enough volume. You should be doing at least 3 to 4 sets of each compound exercise, using a weight you can only lift 5 times per set. The volume of your workout is determined by this formula: reps x sets x weight = volume. However, when it comes down to a choice between more repetitions or more sets, you should choose more sets every time.  Focus on high intensity. Push yourself hard in the gym - only by pushing yourself to your physical limit will you maximize your testosterone production. Increase intensity by performing each exercise more slowly and by resting for no longer than two minutes between sets, High intensity interval training, or HIIT, is another form of exercise which can actively increase testosterone levels, in addition to improving fitness and speeding up the metabolism.  HIIT involves performing an exercise in a short, intense burst then following it up with an easier, recovery exercise. This process is then repeated several times throughout the workout.This type of exercising can be adapted for most types of exercise - you can perform HIIT on the treadmill, the elliptical, in the swimming pool, etc. Just use the following formula: perform the high-intensity exercise for approximately 30 seconds, then follow it up with approximately 90 seconds of slower recovery exercise. Repeat this 7 more times for best results.Even 20 minutes of this type of exercise can reap huge rewards - so there's no excuse for not finding the time.  While cardio exercise won't have a huge impact on testosterone production, it can still have a positive impact on overall testosterone levels. As a result, you should try to incorporate some running, swimming, spinning or other aerobic exercise into your fitness plan.  Cardio is one of the best ways to burn fat, so incorporating a little running or swimming into your weekly exercise plan will help you to shed any extra pounds. This is good news, as being overweight can negatively impact testosterone.  When you're stressed, your body releases a chemical called cortisol which, amongst other things, inhibits testosterone production. Cardio exercise is also a great form of stress-relief so it can reduce your body's cortisol production, thus increasing testosterone.  However, cardio should be practiced in moderation - there's no need to become a long-distance runner. In fact, a study conducted by the University of British Columbia found that male runners who ran more than 40 miles (64 km) per weeks had lower levels of testosterone than short-distance runners., Despite the importance of exercise, it is imperative that you give your body the time it needs to recover between workouts. Otherwise, your exercise regime may be having a negative effect on your testosterone levels.  A study conducted by the University of North Carolina found that over-training can decrease men's testosterone levels by up to 40%. Therefore, it is very important that you take at least two days off from intense exercise per week, and that you avoid working the same muscle groups in two consecutive training sessions.On days when you're not exercising intensely, just try to be more more active than usual. Take the stairs instead of the elevator, walk or bike to work, use a standing desk instead of sitting down all day. These small changes help to keep your body moving, which is good news for testosterone levels.  Sleep is a very important factor when it comes to testosterone levels. This is because your body uses the time you're asleep to produce more testosterone. Therefore, you should do your very best to get at least 7 to 8 hours sleep a night.  A study conducted at the University of Chicago found that men who spent less than 5 hours sleeping for 7 consecutive nights produced 10% to 15% less testosterone compared to when they were fully rested.In addition to decreased testosterone production, being sleep deprived also increases the amount of cortisol (the stress hormone) in your system, and high levels of cortisol negatively impact testosterone levels.  Not getting enough sleep also interferes with your growth hormones, which can prevent you from building muscle when you work out.You should also try to improve the quality of your sleep by turning off all computers and electronics an hour before bed, avoiding caffeinated drinks late in the evening, and having a hot shower before bed.  Many experts believe that stress is one of the major contributing factors in the widespread fall in testosterone levels in modern day men. This is because the hormone which causes stress - cortisol - has been found to have an inverse relationship with testosterone.  In other words, when cortisol levels are high, testosterone levels are low, and vice versa. It is believed that cortisol, which puts your body in 'fight or flight' survival mode, conflicts with testosterone-related behaviors such as aggression, competition and mating. This is why the two cannot co-exist harmoniously.In order to maximize testosterone levels, it is important to minimize stress in any way you can. Consider trying deep breathing techniques, meditation, yoga or visualization.  Alcohol can have a negative impact on your testosterone production. Binge drinking can negatively affect the endocrine system, which, in turn, prevents the testes from producing testosterone.  In addition, alcohol raises cortisol levels and inhibits growth hormones - bad news for testosterone.  Unfortunately, beer is the worst type of alcohol when it comes to healthy testosterone. This is because the hops used to make beer are full of estrogen (the female hormone). So you might switch to drinking liquor instead, or nothing at all.When drinking, it's best to cut yourself off after two/three drinks, as this will limit the damage to your testosterone levels.  Caffeine needs to be taken in moderation, otherwise it can produce cortisol, which negatively impacts testosterone levels.In addition, consuming too much caffeine late in the day can disrupt sleeping patterns - and less sleep means less testosterone.  However, recent studies have shown that consuming caffeine before a workout can actually boost your performance - so if you're really craving a cup of coffee, have one before you pump iron. , Luckily, increasing your testosterone levels doesn't have to be all work and no play. There are several enjoyable things you can do to boost your T.  Watch more sports. Researchers at the University of Utah have found that the testosterone levels of sports fans are linked with their favorite team's performance. The testosterone levels of the research subjects increased by up to 20% when their team won, but decreased by the same percentage when their team lost. Therefore you should feel completely justified in watching more sports - as long as you're sure your team will win!Have more sex. You probably know that testosterone is what fuels men's sex drive, but did you know that it also works the other way around? That's right; having sex can actually increase your testosterone levels. And not only that - just the fact of having an erection, or getting turned on by an attractive woman is enough to boost testosterone.Enjoy the great outdoors. Getting outside and enjoying the sunshine can be hugely beneficial to testosterone. In fact, exposing yourself to those vitamin D filled rays for just 15 to 20 minutes a day can increase T levels by a whopping 120%. If you can sunbathe naked, the results are even higher. Just don't get caught., Studies have found that men with high blood pressure are 1.8 times likelier to have low testosterone than their counterparts.There are specific diets than you can start on — such as the DASH diet — in order to decrease your high blood pressure and improve your testosterone levels.  Other factors such as reducing stress, cutting out booze and alcohol, and maintaining a healthy weight can all help to reduce blood pressure.  And if all else fails, blood pressure medication can help to keep your hypertension under control. See your doctor to figure out the best course of action for you.  Xenoestrogens are chemicals that mimic the effects of estrogen in the body, which is bad news for your testosterone levels. Unfortunately xenoestrogens (like other endocrine disruptors) have infiltrated almost every part of daily lives and are impossible to avoid completely. Here are some ways you can limit your exposure:  Avoid heating food in plastic containers. If you're heating up leftovers, make sure to transfer your food to a plate before popping in the microwave. Most plastic containers contain phthalates (a type of xenoestrogen) which can be transferred to your food when the plastic is heated. If possible, store your food in glass containers instead.  Limit exposure to pesticides and gasoline. Both of these contain xenoestrogens, so try to limit your exposure as much as possible. If you come in contact with either, wash your hands thoroughly afterwards.  Eat organic produce. Non-organic foods are often sprayed with pesticides and pumped with hormones which mimic the effects of estrogen in the body. Choose organic product when possible, or at least wash fruit and veg thoroughly before eating and avoid meat and dairy products which come from cows that have been treated with hormones.  Use natural grooming products. Items such as shampoos, soaps, toothpastes and deodorants can introduce xenoestrogens to the body, so consider making the switch to more natural versions of these products., If you believe you may be suffering from a condition called low-T, consult with your doctor. Your doctor will be able to prescribe medicine that will help your body produce more of its super-hormone.  ","alter your eating habits. get some nuts. eat oysters and other zinc-rich foods. start the day with oatmeal. gobble eggs. eat cabbage. reduce your sugar intake. take vitamin d3. stay away from supplements that aren't backed up by scientific evidence. develop an exercise plan and stick to it. start lifting weights. try high intensity interval training. do some cardio. allow your body to recover between workouts. get enough sleep. avoid stress. cut back on the booze. reduce your caffeine intake. indulge in things you enjoy. address high blood pressure levels. avoid xenoestrogens. see your doctor.

"Do this at least twice a day, for at least two minutes each session.Invest in a portable toothbrush and toothpaste if you frequently consume garlic or onion.  Brushing on its own only cleans just over half of the surface of your teeth, and thus it is important to floss, as well.You should ideally be doing this after every meal.  An antibacterial mouthwash containing chlorhexidine, hydrogen peroxide, or cetylpyridinium chloride will help to prevent bad breath. Many brands of mouthwash contain alcohol, which can dry out your mouth (a cause of bad breath), so avoid these brands if possible., The filaments on your tongue trap tiny particles and bacteria; the major proportion of odor-producing bacteria are found on the tongue. Thus, when you brush your teeth, also clean your tongue with a tongue cleaner or toothbrush., Using an irrigator or water pick cleans food particles from around and under your gums and between your teeth.If you aren't getting foods out through the methods listed above, they are rotting and festering in your mouth; a water pick will help to remove stubborn food particles.  ","brush your teeth. floss. use mouthwash. use a tongue cleaner. use a water pick. "
"The environment around us often plays a big role in how alert we are. Natural sunlight can improve your mood even when you suffer from seasonal mood changes. We are ingrained so that natural light makes us feel like we should be awake. Try to change your workspace or environment to incorporate natural light. , If you don't have access to natural light, even turning on the lights can make you feel more awake. Dim lighting promotes fatigue and signals to our body that it is time to go to sleep. By turning on the lights, you can make yourself more alert and awake.  It's probably not the first thing you think of, but engaging your senses with aromatherapy is a proven way to become more awake. Certain scents such as peppermint, rosemary, eucalyptus or citrus-y scents can make you feel re energized and focused. Buy a candle or air freshener of these particular scents to rev up your environment.  You can also buy essential oils from a health food store and dab a few drops underneath your nose.  Stay away from lavender, vanilla and jasmine. These are all very soothing scents that promote sleepiness and relaxation. , A messy or disorganized space can really drag you down. Having a clean space can make you feel proactive and less tired.Try clearing out your space and see how that affects your tiredness level. , Having music in the background of whatever you are doing is a great way to stimulate your brain. Studies have found that music can make you feel happier and increase your productivity. If you are not distracted by music, try putting on some energetic tracks. If words distract you too much, play instrumental music or nature sounds. Tap your feet. Following along with the music, even just a little bit, engages your body and will help you feel more alert and in the moment.  Nature sounds can act as white noise that will stop you from getting distracted by what is going on around you. Because you will be more focused, you will also feel more present and awake.

"In most cases, moisture will help you retain your sunless color. However, baby oil has the opposite effect and will loosen the skin cells pigmented with sunless tanner. Using a baby oil treatment can tone down or completely remove self-tanner without harming your skin.  Soak your skin in baby oil and leave it on for ten minutes. Then hop in the shower and gently scrub your skin with a loofah to remove the color. Repeat the process if necessary.;  , Exfoliation is one of the most effective ways to remove and smooth sunless tanner. By pairing exfoliation mitts with the acidity of lemon juice, you can break up and lift off the color from your skin.  Spread lemon juice on the part(s) of your body where you want to remove sunless tanner with a cotton pad or ball. After you’ve finished this, put on your exfoliator mitts and hop in the shower. Rub the lemon juice into your skin with the mitts and then rinse it off with warm water. Repeat the process if necessary to remove any remaining color., You can also lighten sunless tanner on your skin without using harsh bleaching agents. A paste of lemon juice and baking soda can lighten up and exfoliate sunless tanner from your skin.  Mix lemon juice and baking soda in a bowl until they form a paste. If you’re using this mixture to remove sunless tanner from your entire body, make sure you mix a larger amount. Lightly rub the paste over the spots from which you want to remove the sunless tanner. Rinse off with warm water and repeat if necessary.Make a paste of baking soda and water if lemon juice is too harsh for your skin.  Vinegar is a multipurpose product that can exfoliate and lift sunless tanner from skin. Apply it for ten minutes to areas of your skin on which you want to remove color. When the ten minutes are over, rinse the area with warm water and check that you’ve removed the amount of color you want.Be aware that your skin may smell like vinegar after using this treatment. Making sure to rinse thoroughly can minimize this odor.  Many companies that make self-tanners also produce removal products.

"Increasingly, women are choosing to sell their used wedding gowns rather than save them forever. It may make more sense to buy and pass on. By doing so, you can save thousands of dollars. A talented seamstress can usually do alterations to fit your properly and styling options.  You may have dreams of having your daughter wear your gown, especially if it was expensive and you want to justify the cost. But you likely do not know if you will have a girl, that she will get married, will be a similar size, and would want to wear your dress simply because what is in fashion today may be tacky or hideous in twenty years.  Check out websites such as Craigslist.org to find used wedding dresses.  Some stores have pre-owned wedding dresses too, which are gently used dresses and which can cost as low as $100. When you consider that the average wedding dress is only worn once for a few hours, it can make a lot of sense to get one that is used.  There are some stores which accept wedding dress donations and then sell those dresses at a steep discount, donating the money made to a charity or cause.  Check with a formal clothing rental store in your area. They may have wedding gowns and men’s suits for rent. Rented wedding dresses can range in price from $200 to $2,000, plus a damage deposit, and will be available for a few days before the wedding. Keep in mind, however, that you will likely not be able to alter this dress., If you are going for a less formal event, (such as a beach wedding) you might wear more casual or non-traditional clothing. Men might wear khaki pants and a button-down shirt and women might wear a white sundress with a simple veil.  Consider your footwear too. If you are getting married in the summer, for example, you might be able to get away with simple white flats, sandals or even flip-flops, if they match the aesthetic of your event.  Wedding dresses in particular can be very expensive, but if you choose a dress that is not sold as a wedding dress, it can mean huge savings. An elegant white formal dress can be absolutely perfect.

Check out various regimental tartans here: http://www.scotclans.com/whats_my_clan/regimental_tartans/  ,  Older, more traditional options include Hunting Stewart, Black Watch, Caledonian, and Jacobite.  Modern universal options include Scottish National, Brave Heart Warrior, Flower of Scotland and Pride of Scotland.  Take a tape measure and measure the distance around both your hips and your waist. These measurements will determine how much material you need for the kilt.  For women, measure around the thinnest part of your waist and the widest part of your hips.  For men, measure around the upper edge of your hip bones and the widest part of your buttocks.  When taking measurements, make sure that the tape measure is taut and parallel to the ground.  A traditional kilt length will equal the length between your waist to your mid-knee. Use a tape measure to calculate this distance.  If you plan to wear a wide kilt belt over your kilt, you should add 2 inches (5 cm) to this measurement for a high-rise waist.  Since you need to form pleats out of your material, you will need a much greater length of material than the distance around your waist.  Measure the width of the 'sett' or pattern on the plaid or tartan material. Each pleat will consist of a full sett with 1 inch (2.5 cm) of exposed pleat. In other words, if the setts on your material are 6 inches (15.25 cm) wide, each pleat will use 7 inches (17.75 cm).  Calculate the amount of material you need by multiplying half of your hip measurement by the amount of material needed for each pleat, and add this value to your full hip measurement. Add an additional 20 percent for additional pleating and centering to get your total number of inches needed. Divide this value by 72 to determine how many yards you need at double width., Pin the top and bottom edges of the material down, making sure that you fold on the outer edge of a sett on both ends. Sew the hems in place with a straight stitch or use an anti-fraying adhesive liquid on the edges.  This will not be necessary if the material has a finished edge at the top and bottom.  The first pleat will help center the material, so it will end up being a little different from the other pleats.  Fold roughly 6 inches (15.25 cm) of material underneath itself at the right side of the material. Pin in place at the waist.  On the left side of the material, make a pleat that encompasses two setts. Secure with a safety pin at the waist.  On a piece of cardboard or durable cardstock, mark the width of one sett. Divide this marked area into three to eight equal parts.  Use your best judgment to determine how many parts to divide the pattern into. The center section will peek through the pleat, so your center section should include an appealing part of the pattern.  Lay your cardboard guide above each sett as you fold it. Overlay the folded edge of each pleat over the part of the pattern that matches it in the set next to it. Secure in place with a safety pin.  The cardboard guide should give you an idea of where to fold your first few pleats. After you begin folding, however, you may find that you do not need the guide since it should become a simple matter of matching the patterns together.  Use a running stitch to catch the edge of each pleat, holding it in place at the bottom of the material.  You should do two rows of basting. The first running stitch should be about 1/4 of the length up from the bottom of the material, and the second should be about 1/2 of the length of from the bottom.  Use an iron with a steam setting to press the pleats in place, making them more durable and helping the pleats keep their form. Iron along each folded edge of each pleat.  If your iron does not use steam, you can moisten a thin pressing cloth and place it over the pleats. Place this pressing cloth in between the iron and the material of your kilt and steam-press the pleats this way.  Sew across the entire width of pleats and down each pleat along the fold.  Sew a straight stitch with your sewing machine across the top of your pleats, roughly 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the upper edge.Sew a straight stitch with your sewing machine across the folded, ironed vertical edge of each pleat. Only sew about 4 inches (10 cm) of material. Do not sew all the way down each pleat.  This pleating method can result in excess material, so you can trim this material off.  Cut away excess material from the section starting 1 inch (2.5 cm) above the hipline and ending at the waist. Do not cut away material from the first and last pleats.  The material should be 5 inches (12.7 cm) wide and the length should match the length of the top edge of your kilt apron.  This should be just slightly longer than your initial waist measurement.  Turn the bottom edge of the waistband material under 1/2 inch (1.27 cm). Sew this folded edge 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the top edge of the kilt apron, on the outside.  The remaining width of the waistband should be folded over the top of the kilt. You do not need to finish it since the lining will cover the raw edges.  Cut 1 yard (91 cm) of duck cloth or canvas into 10-inch (25-cm) wide sections.  The lining will be formed from three pieces of 10-inch (25-cm) wide strips.  Wrap the first section along the wearer's back.  Attach two additional sections to the first at the spots on the right and left where a side seam would usually appear.  Bring these two side sections together, bringing them around the front until each piece meets the side seam on the opposing side.  Pin everything in place.  Align the top edge of the lining to the inside top of the waistband and sew in place.  Do an overlap stitch along the top inside of the apron to tack the lining to the kilt apron.  Only the top needs to be attached. You do not need to sew the bottom of the lining to the outer apron.  Note that the inside of the waistband will also be sewn under the lining, securing it in place.  Fold the bottom edge of the lining under and sew a straight stitch along the material, hemming it in place. Do not sew it to the outer apron.  You could also use anti-fraying adhesive liquid if you do not want to stitch the hem closed.  You will need two leather belts that are roughly 1 inch (2.5 cm) in width and long enough to wrap around your waist.  The first leather belt should go just below the waistband, on the underside of the kilt.  The second leather belt should go just above the bottom part of the sewn-down portion of your pleats. Again, it should be on the underside of the kilt.  Sew the belts in place. The leather portion of the belts should be attached to the lining while the buckle portions should be attached to the pleats.  For additional support, sew a strip of Velcro onto the top of the apron.  One half of the Velcro should be sewn across the top right of the front flap while the other half should be sewn to the top wrong-side of the left.  With this, your kilt should be complete. Wear it by wrapping the material around your waist and buckling the belts so that the material stays in place. Use the Velcro to add extra support so that your kilt stays firmly in place.  ","choose a tartan by clan. pick a district tartan.district tartans are as old as clan tartans, if not older. opt for a regimental tartan. stick with a universal tartan when all else fails.universal tartan patterns can be worn by any person regardless of clan, district, or other identifying information. take hip and waist measurements. determine the length of the kilt. calculate how much material you need. hem the material, if necessary. make the first pleat. measure out your pleats. pleat the remainder of the outside apron. baste the pleats along the bottom of the material. iron the pleats flat. stitch the pleats down. trim the back of the pleats. cut a piece of matching material for the waistband. stitch the waistband to the top edge of the outside apron. cut a piece of duck cloth into sections. gradually wrap sections of duck cloth around your waist. stitch the lining to the waistband. hem the material. attach two thin belts to the inside of the kilt. stitch velcro onto the apron. wear the kilt.

"This will cleanse your hair of any silicones – ingredients in some hair products that are not water soluble (see the Warnings section below). You do not have to buy a new shampoo for this step, just use something lying around the house. Sulfate containing and sulfate free shampoos will both work to remove most silicones.But to be safe, it's best to use a sulfate containing shampoo for your last wash.  ;  , Most shampoos contain harsh, drying sulfates that are extremely damaging for curly hair (ammonium laureth sulfate, ammonium lauryl sulfate, sodium laureth sulfate, sodium lauryl sulfate, etc.). These common detergents found in shampoos make curly hair frizzy and uncooperative.Conditioner can be used sufficiently to clean the hair in a much more gentle manner. If you cannot let go of shampoo, use a more gentle shampoo that contains mild cleansers (i.e. cocamidopropyl betaine or coco betaine).  'You'd never dream of washing a good sweater with detergent. Yet most shampoos contain harsh detergents (sodium lauryl sulfate or laureth sulfate) that one also finds in dish washing liquid. They're great for pots and pans because they cut grease so effectively. Your hair, on the other hand, needs to retain some natural oils, which protect your hair and scalp. Stripping them away deprives the hair of necessary moisture and amino acids and makes it look dry and dull.' - Lorraine Massey  To the bottom is an image of a shampoo and a bottle of dish detergent. Above, the same sulfate is circled in their ingredients list.

You can use the same conditioner or different ones. You will also want any serums, gels, or mousses, but keep in mind these all need to be free of silicones. (You may also want a sulfate free shampoo if you spend a lot of time in chlorine.)

"One of the keys to having your notes organized is to make sure you're taking good notes. This means that you only write down the really important things and don't take down every single thing your instructor says (unless it's really funny, of course).Note down things that the instructor says more than once. Reiterating points is a way of highlighting what the most important material is going to be. Anything that's repeating is probably going to end up on a test or at least be important to understanding the class.  Be selective (don’t take down every single note): take down the main points of the lecture or discussion; write down examples or hypotheticals, especially in math and science classes.  A piece of information usually has a main idea and supportive details, which can also be very important, but the main idea is definitely something worth noting. In paragraphs, the main idea is usually either the first or the last sentence. In good presentations, the bullet points on the slides are often main ideas.;  , There are lots of different ways of recording information. You can use one style or a mix of a few. The mix is best, because usually you can acquire more information and in different ways.Handwritten notes work best for classes that have to do with: numbers, equations, and formulas–calculus, chemistry, physics, economics, symbolic logic, also language classes because helps you memorize/remember more effectively.  You can also record the lecture or discussion, if your instructor allows you to do so. This is great for allowing you to go back and listen to very specific parts of the lecture, although it can be harder to make information stick in your memory.  Make sure you collect any lecture notes and power-point slides that your instructor makes available. These can be valuable notes for essays and exams.  There are different ways to take down notes, some of which are more effective than others at helping you to stay organized or get organized later. You'll need to experiment to see which methods work best for you.An effective method is the Cornell method of note-taking. On the left-hand side of the paper mark a two and one half inch column (6.35 cm). On the right side have a column six inches across (15.24 cm). You'll use the right-hand column to take notes during your class or lecture. After the lecture, you'll summarize your notes, designate keywords, and create questions about the material in the left-hand column.  A lot of people use the rough outline method. This basically means writing down the main points of the lecture or class (you can format them as a list of bullet points, for example). After class, write your summary of the notes in a different colored pen, or highlight it.  Mind mapping is a more visual and creative form of taking notes. You draw your notes, rather than writing down sentences in a linear format. Write the main topic of the lecture or class in the center of a piece of paper. Each time the instructor makes a new point, write those around the central topic. Draw lines to connect different ideas. You can also draw images rather than writing words.  Another method, known as Split Page Method, is more space-consuming than Cornell notes, but easier to study later. A page is divided into two columns: one for main and the other for secondary ideas.  If you're storing your notes all over the place it's going to make it very difficult to organize them for exams and essays when the time comes. Don't just write your notes down in whatever notebook you happen to have nearby or you're never going to find those notes again.  On your computer, make sure that you have one folder for your notes from each different class. If you put them all together it's going to be difficult to find them again.  It's usually easier to store any handwritten notes in a binder, because you can add and subtract pages as needed without having to tear them out.  A lot of people (especially freshman university students) don't realize how important syllabi and hand-outs are going to be. These have information you're going to need to know (like homework assignments, the purpose of the class, and so on).  These will also usually detail information about the types of essays and information you're going to need to know which can be useful for what kinds of notes you take in class.  Keep all the syllabi and hand-outs for each class in the same place as your notes so that they are easily accessible, especially when your instructor brings up information on them in class.  You really do need to keep everything in the same place. This makes it easier for you to locate it when you need it. If you have a distinct folder for each class you will know exactly where your notes are.  Make sure you keep these different notebooks and binders handy. It isn’t much use to you if you don’t keep putting class notes in the right place.  The more specific you are, the better. This means that for one class you might create different folders for the different parts of the class. As an example: if you had a film class split into four parts, you might have a different notebook for each part of the class.  As another example: you have different folders for each section of the class (for Latin class you have a different folder for each different part of speech ).  If you keep all your notes on your computer, make sure that even there you have separate spaces for your notes. You don't want to have to back through and dig through your computer files.  Have folders in those folders for particular information. For example: you have the main folder that's for your Ancient Astronomy class, but inside you have specific folders for the different sections of the class, as well as for the two essays you have to write.  As another example, you might have a folder for your research paper, a folder for your information about gender identity politics in your gender studies class.  This may sound like overkill, but it can be really helpful for you to know what notes you have. You only need to cover the most basic ideas that each group of notes has (the very main ideas) but it'll make it easier to go back through it.  Combine lecture and reading notes into coherent whole. Figure out main ideas and how they relate. For example: if your class is about Medieval women, the main ideas might be about formation of self, types of writings, notions of autonomy and gender, and so on. You might show how these ideas relate to one another.  Make sure that you've covered the most important points, as well as the sub-points that support the main points.  You don't want to have to keep trying to figure out how and where you recorded certain information. This will make your organization more difficult in the long run. If you keep to one way of recording notes and specific places for each class, you'll be much more prepared than otherwise.  Giving yourself some slack on organization will mean that you won’t maintain your organization and it will be more difficult come exam time or essay time.  ","take good notes. mix different styles of note-taking. figure out which note-taking method works best for you. store your notes in one place. keep track of your hand-outs and syllabi. have a separate notebook or binder for each class. on a computer have separate folders for each class. create a master outline of notes for each class. stay consistent.

"The best chance of your ears healing depends on how nice you were to your ears during the stretching process. If you barged ahead and sized up every other week, you most likely caused small tears and potentially ripped the delicate tissue of your holes. If you allowed them to heal for at least a month before sizing up, that will speed up the healing process and your ears will thank you.  Remember never to stretch dry. Always use some kind of lube, like a special stretching balm, Vitamin E oil, or coconut oil. Stretching in or after a hot shower has been said to help with the stretching process. Also, tapers are not meant to be worn as jewelry, because the weight is uneven, so only use them for stretching. Don't use acrylic or silicone tapers; although acrylic tapers are the cheapest and easiest to find, acrylic can't be fully sterilized, and silicone tapers can cause blowouts due to trapped bacteria.;  , For example, if your normal gauge is a 000 (10.4 mm), put a 00 (9.26 mm) in your ear.  If you have gone above a 12 mm g, it is unlikely that you will experience much shrinkage. This is because stretching your ears involves (surprise, surprise) stretching--you stretch the tissue of your ear and then allow it to heal. If blowouts, tearing or infections occur, scar tissue builds up which can sometimes keep ear lobes from shrinking back to normal once they have been stretched. Of course, everyone's body is different. Just be aware of the potential that your ears might not shrink back without surgery., You should wear the smaller gauge until your ear has shrunk down so that this gauge fits well. This may take only a few days for some people, and longer than a week for others.  The smallest is a 17g (1.14 mm). Most wire earrings are .812 mm and studs are 1.02 mm.  ","gauge correctly in the first place. decrease the the gauge you are wearing by 'going down' one size. wear the smaller gauge for a week. repeat this process until you are wearing the smallest gauge.

"Depending on how you want to use the vodka, price will be an important consideration. More expensive vodkas like Belvedere, Ciroc and Grey Goose offer subtle flavors and aromas for $30 or more. These vodkas are most suitable for making drinks with a high vodka content, or for shots at a special occasion. A liter of less expensive vodkas like Smirnoff and Svedka can be purchased for $10 to $15, and these vodkas are perfect for larger parties with guests more interested in social drinking than flavor profiles. Cheaper vodka is also best for making cocktails or mixed drinks with low alcohol content, as the more pungent taste of fruit in these drinks will drown out the majority of the subtleties in more expensive vodka.;  , Cheap to medium priced brands like Smirnoff and Absolut offer a very wide selection of vodka flavors, from passionfruit to green apple to whipped cream and even fluffed marshmallow. Specialty brands like Bakon provide more interesting flavors like bacon vodka, while more expensive brands focus primarily on the core taste. Consider purchasing flavored vodka if you wish to make the taste of a shot less pungent, or if you are making a mixed drink with complementary flavoring. Bakon's bacon flavored vodka, for example, is an interesting choice for making bloody marys, as the bacon taste matches the bloody mary. Fruit flavored vodka, like raspberry or peach Smirnoff and cherry infused Skyy may work better for fruity flavored mixed drinks.  Stronger vodkas offer 80 to 100 proof selections, providing drinks with up to 40% alcohol content. Higher alcohol content vodkas will have a more strong taste, and many consumers will prefer to chase these vodkas or use them in a mixed drink. Vodkas with less alcohol content may be more expensive but will generally be less pungent.  More expensive vodkas will be distilled up to 4 times, enhancing the flavoring and intensity of the drink. These vodkas will also be made of less ingredients, using mostly potato or wheat. If you have a tighter budget, you may sacrifice the number of distillations or filterings for price, impacting the quality of the vodka.  ","narrow down the vodka choices by selecting a price range for your purchase. consider the flavor of the vodka. determine the alcohol content of the vodka you wish to purchase. research the preparation of the vodka, including the primary ingredients that compose the drink.

"To calculate the gross income of a supporting parent, you must add up the total amount of the person’s monthly income from whatever source. Sources of income can include but are not limited to:  Compensation for services, including fees, commissions, fringe benefits, and similar items;  Income derived from a business;  Any gains derived from property deals;  Interest earned;  Income from rents, royalties or dividends;  Alimony and separate maintenance payments;  Annuities and pensions;  Income from life insurance and endowment contracts;  Income from discharge of indebtedness;  Distributive share of partnership gross income;  Income in respect of a decedent  Income from an interest in an estate or trust.;  , Once you have determined the person’s gross income, you can calculate the net income by subtracting from the gross income all allowable deductions. The amount left is the net income.  Deduct federal and state income taxes and Social Security.  Deduct mandatory retirement contributions required by law or as a condition of employment (do not include voluntary contributions to a 401k or other retirement fund).  Deduct union dues.  Deduct dependent and individual health insurance premiums.  Deduct life insurance premiums that were court ordered to secure support payments.  Deduct any prior obligations of support or maintenance that are paid pursuant to court order.  Deduct foster care payments paid by the Department of Children and Family Services.  Deduct the monthly amount spent to repay certain debts, such as student loan payments or necessary medical benefits.To determine the amount of monthly income taxes and Social Security deductions, look at a person’s pay stub to see how much is withheld on a monthly basis.  Even if a parent claims that he or she does not have any income, a judge may still order the person to pay child support. The judge will order child support if he or she finds that the parent could be making more money or earning an income but is failing to do so because they are not really looking for a job or they are deliberately choosing low-paying positions for which they are overqualified., Under the State of Illinois’ child support guidelines, the noncustodial parent is required to pay a percentage of his or her net income in child support. The percentage a person is required to pay increases with the number of children.  The allowable percentage for one child is 20%.  The allowable percentage for two children is 28%.  The allowable percentage for three children is 32%.  The allowable percentage for four children is 40%.  The allowable percentage for five children is 45%.  The allowable percentage for six or more children is 50%., You can calculate the amount of child support by first moving the decimal point two spots to the left of the percent amount (20% becomes .20) and then multiply that number by the monthly net income amount. For example, 1000 x .20 = $200 in monthly child support. This calculation of child support is used whether you are applying for long-term or temporary child support.  You can also calculate the percentage using a free online percentage calculator at http://www.percentagecalculator.net.  The amount of child support will be set forth in a judge’s order (discussed in more detail below)., Under Illinois law, a court may deviate from the standard child support percentage and consider other factors that may either increase or decrease a parent’s contribution to child support. In a parent’s Petition for Child Support (discussed in more detail below), a person can specifically ask the court to increase or decrease child support and set forth the reasons for this deviation from the standard percentage. In his or her Response to the Petition for Child Support, a parent can set forth his or her arguments against considering the additional expenses. If the court finds the parent’s request for additional support to be reasonable, the court may consider the following expenses in adjusting the amount of child support:  Health needs not covered by insurance  Child care  Education  Extracurricular activities, There are online calculators that are designed to assist you in calculating the amount of child support that a noncustodial parent must pay. These calculators ask you a number of questions and then calculate the amount based on your responses. You can locate an online calculator at http://www.alllaw.com/calculators/childsupport/illinois. You can also use the “Calculating Child Support Obligation Form” located at https://www.illinois.gov/hfs/ChildSupport/Documents/hfsweb016.pdf. Generally, you will be asked to provide the following information:  The number of children for whom the noncustodial parent is the legal parent and for whom you are seeking support.  Income of the noncustodial parent.  Monthly cost of family group health insurance paid by the noncustodial parent.  Amount of monthly alimony paid by a noncustodial parent to the spouse from a prior marriage.  Amount of monthly child support paid by the noncustodial parent for children from a prior marriage  The county in which you live, In order to calculate a noncustodial parent’s net income, you need access to his or her financial information. If the child’s noncustodial parent denies his parentage, you may need a legal determination of parentage in order for the noncustodial parent to be compelled by the court to turn over his financial information. If you have never been married and you are seeking child support, you should establish legal parentage of the noncustodial parent in order to have a child support determination based on the person’s financials., Only legal parents are obligated to pay child support. You are a legal parent if: you are a biological parent of the child, you adopted a child, or you were married to the biological mother at the time of birth and therefore you are considered the presumed legal parent.If you accept that you are the legal parent but you were not married at the time the child was born, you can voluntarily establish legal parentage.  To establish voluntary legal parentage, you must have the biological mother’s agreement and complete the Voluntary Acknowledgment of Paternity (VAP) form, which is located at: https://www.illinois.gov/hfs/ChildSupport/Documents/hfs3416b.pdf.  Both the father and mother must sign the form.  You must then file the signed original form with Department of Healthcare and Family Services (HFS) by sending it to: Administrative Coordination Unit (ACU), 110 West Lawrence Avenue, Springfield, Illinois 62704.  The form can be signed either before or after the child’s birth, and is effective either when the child is born or when the document is filed with HFS, whichever is later.  You can not use this form if you are a same-sex couple., If the mother of your child is married or was married within 300 days of when the child was born, you can take steps to establish your legal parentage. In addition to completing and having the mother of your child sign the Voluntary Acknowledgment of Paternity (discussed above), you must also have the mother’s spouse sign a denial of parentage.  You must do this even if the mother states that you are the biological parent of the child.  You can download a Voluntary Denial of Paternity form at: https://www.illinois.gov/hfs/ChildSupport/Documents/hfs3416d.pdf  The husband has the right to seek genetic confirmation that he is not the biological father of the child., If you were never married to the other parent, you can file a Petition to Establish Parentage. You must complete the Petition and file it with your local county court clerk.  If you are a mother seeking to establish paternity, you can download the Petition at: https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/sites/default/files/legal_content/file_form_content/ParentageAndAllocationPetitionMother_0.pdf.  If you are a father seeking to establish your paternity, you can download the Petition at: https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/sites/default/files/legal_content/file_form_content/ParentageAndAllocationPetitionFather.pdf.  You must bring one original and two copies to the court clerk to be filed.  You must also pay a filing fee. You can contact the court to find out the amount of the fee and the accepted methods of payment for your local court.  You will receive a Paternity Return Date Summons document from the clerk. You must fill in your name as the petitioner and the other parent’s name as respondent, as well as the address for each person.Keep one copy for yourself and the other copy will be served on the respondent parent.  After filing your Petition and receiving your Summons, you should take the Summons and one copy of the Petition to the local sheriff. The court clerk will be able to provide you information on where to locate the sheriff for your county.  The sheriff will serve (deliver a copy) to the parent for whom you are trying to establish parentage.  To check on the status of the service of process, you can call your local court clerk and ask when the Petition and Summons were served.  The document will have a return date, which is the date by which they must respond to the petition. The parent can respond by showing up in court on the return date., Once the respondent parent is served, you can contact the local court clerk to schedule a hearing date on your Petition. The clerk will provide you with a date and you must fill out and mail a copy of the Notice of Hearing to the respondent spouse.  Fill out the document and make two copies.  File the original with the court clerk and mail a copy to the respondent parent by mail. You should keep the other copy for yourself.  You must also fill out of a Proof of Mailing – Notice of Hearing and file the original with the court.  You can download a Notice of Hearing and Proof of Mailing at: http://www.illinoislegaladvocate.org/Uploads/69006900Paternity_Child_Sppt_Mother.pdf.  Both parents are required to attend the hearing. Before court, the petitioner parent must complete and Order for Parentage & Allocation of Parental Responsibilities form by filling out both parent’s names at the top of the Order.  The judge may sign the order after hearing testimony.  If the mother denies that a petitioner father is the parent, the judge may order DNA testing. If the testing establishes parentage, a judge will issue an order establishing paternity of the father., DHS provides numerous services for people who receive public benefits and for those who do not. By completing an application for child support with DHS, you begin the process of seeking child support.  Depending on whether you receive benefits or not, DHS will help: search for the other parent; establish legal parentage (paternity); obtain a child support order or work to enforce an existing order; serve an “Income Withholding Notice for Child Support” on the other parent's employer; and assist in getting medical insurance for the child.

You must also sign the petition and print or type your name., Once you have filed your Petition, you must serve the Petition on the other parent along with Summons that you received from the court. The Sheriff from the county where you live will be able to serve the document for you., Once the other parent responds to the Petition, the court will schedule a hearing to decide on the amount of child support that should be awarded. After hearing testimony and having both parents complete a Disclosure Statement regarding income assets, the judge will issue an Order that outlines the amount of monthly child support payments., Once the judge issues his or her order setting forth the amount of child support, you must send a Notice to Withhold Income to the other parent’s employer. You must set forth the amounts and instructions as established by the court order.

"It's important to look closely at the carburetor and the oil compartment to make sure you're not tilting the mower in such a way as to spill oil all over the engine, the grass, and yourself. Generally, the safest way to do this is to tilt the mower back, toward the handle, and prop it with some kind of weight, or the help of a partner. This won't necessarily be true for all mowers, however, so use your judgment and consult the owner's manual, if necessary.  It's also best to do this when there's no gas in the mower. Wait until you use it all up to change the blade, or you might consider draining out the gas with syphon hose. Typically, self-syphon pumps are sold at any hardware or automotive parts store. This prevents gas spillage onto the mower body.;  , It's best to stay on the safe side and prevent a short-out or electrical flare-up if any oil or gas should come in contact with the spark plug. It shouldn't be a problem if you hold the mower properly, but it's still best to be on the safe side., Use a socket wrench of the appropriate size and unbolt the mounting, while using your other hand to keep the blade from turning. Be careful not to lose any washers or mounting hardware that hold the blade into place, which can be reused.  Pay attention to the position of the blade as you're removing it. You'll mount the new one in the same orientation, usually with the sharp edge of the blade going counter-clockwise with the turning of the assembly. Again, this may not be true on all mowers, so pay attention to the way this blade is installed and install the new blade accordingly.  Replacement blade kits for push powers are generally only a few dollars at most home improvement or hardware stores, featuring new pre-weighted and sharpened blades, and usually replacement nuts. If your blades are particularly worn out, it's a good idea to invest in a new set.  Some mowers feature a bottom cap on which two shorter separate blades are attached, while some newer push mowers feature a single longer blade, that looks kind of like a ruler. Tilt the mower back to inspect the blade, or talk to someone at the hardware store about the type of blade appropriate for your brand of mower. You can also check in the owner's manual, if you have it.Alternatively, you can salvage the old blades and have them sharpened if they seem to be in decent condition. If the blades are worn out, with chips or chunks out of the metal, it's probably wise to get a new set.  Line up the blades as they were lined up before and reinstall the washers and nuts, or use new washers and nuts of the appropriate size. If you have the owner's manual, there should be torque specs for tightening the nut. If not, just make sure not to over-tighten and warp the blade, which can cause vibrations in the mower.  Most blades are either specific or universal fit. Be sure you have the same length as the old blade before mounting the new one, and make sure the clearance from the lawn mower deck is the same. Tighten the new blade onto the bolts carefully, since it'll likely be much sharper than the old one.  It's a good idea to wear thick mechanic gloves when doing the job, to keep your hands safe. It's also advisable to use a small piece of wood to stop up the blade from turning while you reinstall it. You can jam a small piece of wood between the blade and the mower deck to keep things from turning.  Be sure the blade is mounted correctly and has no wobble when you move it up and down, firmly. Remove any jacks or props used to hold mower in place and wait about 30-60 minutes for oil to return to motor to prevent issues or motor damage. Check the oil before use to ensure it is within the proper limits.  Check the air filter to be sure that oil did not saturate the foam filter, if necessary, and reattach the spark plug wire.  After a quick inspection, you should be able to start up your mower and start cutting that grass much more efficiently with your new blades.  ","lift the mower deck to expose the blade. unplug the spark plug. remove the blade mounting bolt. purchase replacement blades. mount the new blade in the appropriate direction. check the blade for play. refill the gas tank and do a pre-check before mowing.

"One way to protect your skin is to keep it out of the sun's rays. When you head outside, especially in the harsh light of summer, try wearing a hat to protect your face.Sun damage makes your skin look older over time. It can make it appear leathery, dry, or discolored.;  , Showers that are too hot or too long can make your skin dry because they wash away your skin's natural oils. Try to take as short a shower as you can. Also, instead of very hot water, stick with warm water to protect your facial skin., Strong soaps, like hot showers, can take too much oil from your skin. These oils keep you naturally hydrated. Without them, your face appears older. Look for soaps that say 'moisturizing' or for 'sensitive skin.', When you get out of the shower, it's tempting to scrub your face and body dry with your towel. However, being too rough isn't good for your skin, plus blotting helps moisture stay on your skin, where it can be absorbed., To protect yourself against the sun, it's important to put on sunscreen every day. Every time you go outside, the sun has a chance to damage your skin, so putting sunscreen on in the morning can help protect you against that damage.Pick one that has an SPF of at least 30 and protects against UVB and UVA rays., Pick a moisturizer designed for your skin type. That is, if you have oily skin, pick one for oily skin; on the other hand, if you have dry skin, choose one that is labelled for dry skin. Apply it to your face after you shower. It can also be helpful to apply it at night.You can also choose a daily moisturizer that has an SPF, meaning you only have to put on one cream in the morning., You already know that smoking is bad for your lungs, but you may not know that it's also hard on your skin. It can make your skin look older because it causes problems with the elastin and collagen in your skin., If you have acne, you may feel like it keeps your face from being fresh-looking. By treating your acne, you'll help your skin look smoother and fresh.To treat acne, you can start by washing your face twice a day with a mild acne cleanser. You can also use acne lotions or creams. If you're still having problems, ask your doctor about prescription creams or cleansers to help clear up your acne.Also, ask about birth control if you have flare-ups around your period. Sometimes, acne is caused by a rise in hormones, so using birth control can help even out your hormones and reduce acne.  ","wear a hat. take shorter showers. choose gentle soaps. blot your skin dry. use sunscreen religiously. moisturize your skin. break your smoking habit. treat acne. "
"All cameras are different, but most have some kind of timer settings that allow you set up the camera and join the group before the picture is taken.  Some cameras even come with a remote feature that allows you to take pictures by clicking the remote rather than figuring out the timer process., Instead of having to find an object to prop the camera on and awkwardly adjust until it is pointing in the right direction, use a tripod. These hold the camera firmly in place and are adjustable to any angle. So you will always be able to aim at exactly the picture you want to capture.  Look through the camera’s lens and make sure everyone is in the frame. If anyone is standing too far outside the camera’s view, tell them to move so that they’ll be in the picture. You can also check that everyone looks acceptable (hair in place, no ruffled clothing, etc.).  The more people there are in a photo, the harder it is to get a good shot of everyone. Someone will inevitably blink or sneeze or look away. This problem gets exponentially worse when people don’t know when the exact moment of the picture will be. If you know your camera takes the photo after five seconds, you need to count out loud to five so everyone can be prepared.Many cameras have a flash feature that warns you when it is about to take the picture. Just make sure that everyone knows what to look for (the flash) so that they can be prepared when it is time for the picture.  ","figure out your camera’s timed photo settings. use a tripod. set the scene. get everyone ready. "
"It is important that children read every day for 20 minutes. Sit with them and listen to them. By doing this you be able to understand their reading abilities, what words and sounds they struggle with.  After the children have read a few pages, stop them and ask them about what they have just read. This allows them to think about the information they have read and begin to process it and not forget it. This is key to building comprehension skills. Ask them questions and try to coax out as much detail as you can out of them. When they come to do comprehension exercises in school later on, they will answer the questions with detail because they're already used to doing so in the home environment., Read out a few of the passages from the book they are reading and ask them to write down what you read. Read each word slowly, give them enough time to think about the word, then ask them to write it down. Having read the words already, they may remember them; however, some words are spelt differently from how they sound.  Check their spellings after and identify the words and sounds they are struggling with and practice those more.  Children have a wild imagination. Set them a few story titles, for example: “Lost in the Woods,” “From Another Planet,” “The Coolest Adventure”. Also set a few personal and descriptive titles, such as: “Describe your house, or a friend or a relative” “My Favourite Country” “My School Trip”. Varying the titles will work their imaginations as well as helping to improve their descriptive writing skills., Ask your children to spend some time rewriting any sentences where you discovered errors, to correct them, but without you identifying which parts are errors. This allows the children to spot the mistakes for themselves. For this exercise, use sentences with missed punctuation, bad spelling, etc. They can read their own writing and correct the mistakes, a skill that is essential for the rest of their lives. Check the work; after this exercise, the parts where they have not noticed the errors is where more attention needs to be given.  ","read every day for 20 minutes. ask questions. use dictation to assist with both comprehension and spelling practice. write stories. find the errors. "
"The risk of having a first-time blood clot (VTE) is 100 in 100,000. However, that risk goes up exponentially as we age: by age 80, the rate of VTE is 500 in 100,000.As you get older, it’s important to monitor your overall health with regular medical checkups.  Recent surgery or a broken bone in your hips or legs increases your risk of blood clots.;  , People who sit more than six hours a day in their leisure time are twice as likely to have pulmonary embolism of those sit for less than two hours. Prolonged periods of lying, sitting, or standing in one place can cause blood stasis, leading to clots. This is one reason why VTE is so common in hospitalized patients, especially after surgery, and people traveling long distances.  People who fall in to the obese category have a much higher risk of VTE than those in a healthy weight range.The correlation is not completely understood, but experts believe at least part of it is due to the estrogen produced by fat cells. Estrogen is an independent risk factor for blood clots.Fat cells also produce proteins called “cytokines,” which may play a role in formation of VTE.Though not always the case, the obese may also lead more sedentary lives than those who fall into healthier weight ranges.  To calculate your BMI, use an online BMI calculator, like the one on the Mayo Clinic website. You will need to input your age, height, weight, and sex for your results.  An obese person will have a BMI of 30 or more. The overweight range is from 25-29.9, and normal from 18.5 to 24.9. Anything below 18.5 is considered underweight.  This is often seen in postmenopausal women who take estrogen supplements as part of hormone replacement therapy. Women who take hormonal contraception to prevent pregnancy and those who are pregnant are also at risk.  Before beginning any hormone therapy, discuss the risks and your options with your doctor.  Without it, you would bleed to death if you cut yourself! While coagulation is normal, hypercoagulation is when the blood clots too much, even when it's still in the body. Hypercoagulation can be caused by long periods of sitting or lying down, cancer, dehydration, smoking, and hormone therapies.You are at risk of hypercoagulation if:  You have a family history of abnormal blood clots.  You personally had a blood clot at young age.  You had blood clots during pregnancy.  You've suffered from multiple unexplained miscarriages.  Some genetic disorders, such as Factor 5 Leiden Disorder or Lupus Anticoagulant, can also cause this condition.  Atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat) and the build up of cholesterol plaques in your arteries can all lead to blood clots.If you have atrial fibrillation, your blood isn't flowing properly, and may pool and begin to clot.People with atrial fibrillation may notice an irregular pulse but no other symptoms; it is usually discovered during routine check-ups. It can be treated with blood thinners or other medications, lifestyle changes, and in some cases a pacemaker or surgery.Waxy cholesterol plaques can build up in your arteries (sometimes as part of atherosclerosis) and, if the plaques break, they can begin the clotting process.Most heart attacks and strokes occur when plaque in your heart or brain bursts., Studies show that 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous exercise a week decreases your risk of many health problems.This averages to 20-30 minutes of aerobic activity (walking, cycling, aerobics, etc.) a day. Choose an activity you enjoy enough to stick with! Exercise keeps your circulation flowing, improving your overall health and preventing VTE.  You can do this while resting or during sleep. Elevate your legs from your feet, not your knees; so, don't prop pillows under your knees to try and elevate them. Instead, raise your feet about six inches above your heart. Avoid crossing your legs.  While it's important to get exercise on a daily basis, it's not enough to sit all day, then run for 20 minutes. If you're sitting or lying down for long periods of time — for example, if you're traveling, work at a computer, or are on bedrest — you need to take exercise breaks. Every two hours, get up and do some light activity. You can just walk around or do stationary calf exercises by rocking back and forth on your heels and toes.  Any situation where you're seated with your legs flexed at the knee (the typical sitting position) puts you at risk. , Severe dehydration 'thickens' the blood and promotes clot formation.Everyone, but especially the elderly and others in high-risk categories, should drink plenty of water. The Institute of Medicine suggests men drink 13 cups of fluids (three liters) per day, and women drink nine cups (2.2 liters).Never let yourself get thirsty. Thirst is the first, most obvious sign of dehydration. If you are feeling thirsty, you are already on your way toward dehydration.  Another early sign a dry mouth or extremely dry skin.  Drinking water immediately should be enough to rehydrate the body. If you are suffering from diarrhea or vomiting, or are sweating excessively, you may need an electrolyte solution like Gatorade to rehydrate.  High estrogen states put women at a higher risk of VTE. But during pregnancy, there's nothing you can do about how much estrogen your body's producing. All you can do is try to avoid other risk factors (like smoking or long periods of sitting) and make sure your situation is being monitored by a medical professional.  If you develop a VTE in a limb, the doctor can prescribe pregnancy-safe medication to prevent it from traveling to the lungs or brain and becoming potentially fatal.  There are risks to taking blood thinners while pregnant, as it can interfere with the attachment of the placenta.  However, in high-stakes VTE situations, Lovenox can potentially save lives. After delivery, the mother will switch to Coumadin, which is safe during breastfeeding.VTE is the leading cause of maternal death in the United States and Western Europe., HRT medications, taken to control the symptoms of menopause, place you at an increased risk of blood clots. A non-hormonal alternative is to try a soy isoflavone treatment like Estroven, which helps with hot flashes but has no VTE risk. You can also get soy from dietary sources like soybeans, soymilk, or tofu. There are, however, no guidelines available to help with dosing.You can also choose to simply live with the symptoms of menopause without treatment. While uncomfortable, they are not bad for your health in any way.  The overall risk for healthy women without other risk factors is still pretty low, though — about one in 3,000 experience VTE.  Women who bleed heavily during menstruation or have abnormal uterine lining should choose non-hormonal options, if available. Non-estrogen (progesterone only) hormonal contraceptives or even non-hormonal choices such as certain IUDs can be considered.  Even if you have a history or risk of blood clots, hormonal contraception can still be taken if you take anticoagulant medication. Your doctor may also choose a very low estrogen form (or even non-estrogen form) of hormonal contraception, which can reduce your risk.  Because the excess of fat cells found in obesity is correlated with VTE risk, you should try to bring your weight down to healthy levels if you are obese (BMI of 30 or greater). The healthiest way to lose weight is through a combination of exercise and responsible dieting. Although you should limit your caloric intake, most nutritionists warn against eating less than 1,200 calories a day.That number may be higher if you're exercising a lot. Consult your dietician for your personal recommendations.  Wear a heart rate monitor while exercising to track your heart rate.  To calculate your target heart rate, first find your maximum heart rate: 220 - your age.Multiply that number by .6 to find your target heart rate, and try to sustain that rate for at least 20 minutes while exercising at least 4 times a week.  For example, for a 50 year old woman, the target heart rate would be (220-50) x .6 = 102.  Compression hose are also known as TET, or thromboembolism-deterrent, hose. People who are on their feet for long hours, such as servers or nurses and doctors, often wear them to improve circulation. They can also be worn after you've already suffered from blood clots to relieve leg pain and swelling.They're sometimes used with hospital patients who spend a lot of time on bed rest.  You can buy compression hose at most drugstores or pharmacies. They only need to be knee high to improve circulation.  If your doctor feels like you are at high risk for a VTE, he may choose to put you on preventive medication. Depending on your individual assessment, he may recommend prescription (Coumadin or Lovenox) or over-the-counter medication, such as aspirin.  Coumadin is a prescribed drug usually taken in one 5 mg oral dose per day.However, in different people, it can produce different interactions with vitamin K, which is critical for normal blood clotting. Thus, dosages can vary wildly.  Lovenox is a prescription injection you can give yourself at home.You will get pre-loaded syringes that need to be administered twice daily. The dosage depends on your weight.  Aspirin is a good over-the-counter option for lower risk patient.It's been proven to prevent thrombotic events from blood clots to stroke and heart attack.  One in five patients with malignant cancer will experience a VTE.This results from a multitude of reasons, including cancer-related inflammation, lack of mobility, or medication side-effects.Cancer patients who get a VTE will be placed on Lovenox or Coumadin and may get an IVC (inferior vena cava) filter. An IVC filter acts like a strainer in case a deep vein clot breaks off from a leg vein. It prevents the clot from reaching the heart or lungs, where it could prove lethal., Although there's anecdotal literature on natural therapies to reduce clot risk in cancer patients, there's no scientific backing to it. It's been argued that phytonutrients can prevent VTE in cancer patients.However, there's no known mechanism that would cause this diet to inhibit inflammation and cytokine production, as argued. Foods suggested in this diet include:  Fruits: Apricots, oranges, blackberries, tomatoes, pineapple, plums, blueberries.  Spices: Curry, cayenne, paprika, thyme, turmeric, ginger, ginko, licorice.  Vitamins: Vitamin E (walnuts and almonds, lentils, oats and wheats) and Omega 3 fatty acids (fatty fish such as salmon or trout).  Plant Sources: sunflower seeds, canola oil, safflower oil.  Supplements: Garlic, Ginko biloba, Vitamin C, nattokinase supplements.  Wine and honey.

"In many states, alimony is discretionary. This means the judge can decide whether to award alimony or not, depending on a variety of circumstances. In about half of the states, the judge will consider “marital fault,” including adultery.You need to find out if your state considers adultery. You should research your state law. Search online for “your state,” “alimony,” and “adultery.”;  , If you can’t find out whether your state considers adultery when deciding alimony, you should consult with an attorney. Only a qualified attorney can give you accurate legal advice about your state law.  You can get a referral to a divorce attorney by contacting your local or state bar association.Call up the attorney and schedule a consultation. Ask how much they charge for a half-hour meeting.  You should also consider hiring the lawyer to represent you. Although you can meet for just a half-hour meeting, you might be better off hiring him or her to handle the divorce for you. Ask how much it would cost.  Although some states consider adultery when determining alimony, it depends on the circumstances. You should discuss your situation with your lawyer.  For example, in Georgia, the adultery must have been the cause of the divorce. It isn’t enough that your spouse cheated five years ago but you reconciled. Instead, the infidelity must have ended the marriage., Your state might not allow a judge to consider adultery. However, you can still try to deny your cheating spouse alimony. Generally, judges consider the following financial factors:Income disparity. If your income is much higher than your spouse’s, then a judge is more likely to award alimony. However, if your incomes are similar, you have a strong argument against alimony.  Each spouse’s future earning potential. Your spouse may not be working now. However, he or she could have a college degree and higher earning power if they got a job. A judge will consider how much your ex “could” make, not how much they do make.  Your standard of living during the marriage. If your spouse became accustomed to a high standard of living, then the judge might award alimony. However, if you had a normal middle-class life, then you could argue that alimony isn’t appropriate, especially when your spouse can maintain that lifestyle on their own.  Whether your spouse stayed home to raise the children. If your spouse didn’t forfeit their career for your family, then you can argue alimony isn’t necessary.  The contribution your spouse made to your career. A spouse who works to put another through school or helps start a business has a stronger claim to alimony. You should point out if your spouse didn’t make any kind of contribution to your career.  In addition to finances, a judge will consider other factors when deciding whether to award alimony. You should try to cite as many as possible to argue against your spouse getting alimony:The length of the marriage. If your marriage was short, then you can argue that alimony isn’t appropriate.  Your spouse’s age. Your spouse is more likely to get alimony the older they are. If your spouse is relatively young, you can argue alimony isn’t necessary.  Your spouse’s emotional or physical condition. If your spouse is disabled, then he or she will have a strong argument for alimony. However, if your spouse is healthy, then you can argue alimony isn’t necessary.  Domestic violence. In California, for example, the judge can lower or eliminate alimony if one spouse has been convicted of domestic violence., You might not be able to prevent alimony, even if your spouse cheated. Nevertheless, you should discuss other potential strategies with your attorney for making sure your spouse gets as few assets as possible.  For example, your spouse might have used marital property to support a lover. In this situation, the judge can deduct the money spent on the lover from the amount of marital property your spouse will get in the divorce., If your spouse pick up an STD during an affair, then you might be able to sue him or her for personal injury if the STD was transmitted to you.You should talk about this option with your lawyer.  You need proof that your spouse has been unfaithful.Although you can tell the judge your suspicions, nothing is more powerful than evidence. In particular, you should try to get your spouse to admit to being unfaithful.  If your spouse admits to cheating, you should write down the day and time of the admission. Because your spouse might try to walk back the admission, you should look for other evidence.  Keep communications. Your ex might slip up and admit to adultery in an email or letter. You should hold onto these communications. You can introduce them into court as evidence.  You can also get evidence of adultery by talking to the person your spouse slept with. He or she might confirm that they slept with your spouse during your marriage. A partner is probably more likely to admit this if their relationship with your spouse has ended.  You don’t have to videotape your spouse “in the act” with someone else. However, you need to prove that he or she had the motive and the opportunity to cheat on you. You can prove motive and opportunity by gathering the following:Photos of your spouse and their lover together. It would be ideal if they were acting in an intimate manner in the photographs.  Phone records that show constant communication between them. Look for late-night calls or calls on the weekend.  Witnesses who saw your spouse and their lover together.  Credit card or bank records that show large purchases, hotel visits, etc.  If your spouse has moved in with his or her lover, then you might be able to eliminate alimony altogether.Some states will prevent a person from getting alimony when they move in with a romantic partner.  You can ask family or friends where your spouse is staying. You may need these people to testify on your behalf.  You might need to hire someone to spy on your spouse. You should think about hiring a private investigator.This person can follow your spouse around and find out who they are spending their time with.  Private detectives generally charge $40-100 per hour. They also charge for additional costs, such as mileage.You can find detectives in the phone book. Call one up and discuss the reasons for hiring them. Discuss the scope of the investigation and what kinds of evidence you want them to gather.  You should probably be the person to file for divorce. You should pick up the forms required to file for divorce from the court clerk at the family law court in the county where you live. Often, these forms are posted online.  Divorce can be “fault” or “no fault.” Almost all states have “no fault” divorce, which means neither party is to blame. However, about two-thirds still allow you to allege “fault,” such as adultery.If you have the option of alleging fault when you file for divorce, then make sure to select adultery.  Some “no fault” states, such as Florida, still consider adultery when determining alimony.For this reason, even in a “no fault” state you should try to mention adultery in the divorce petition.  Your spouse might have beat you to the courthouse and have filed for divorce first. He or she should ask for alimony in the petition. In this situation, you will be able to “answer” the divorce petition and explain why your spouse isn’t entitled to alimony.Mention the infidelity and all other reasons.  You have to file your papers with the court clerk. Make several copies. You also have to give your spouse a copy of everything you file in your case.This is called “making service.”  You can generally make service of divorce papers by paying the sheriff or constable to serve them. You cannot serve them yourself.Depending on your court, you can also hire a private process server, which you can find in the phone book. They make service for a small fee.  You might also ask someone 18 or older who isn’t a party to the case to serve the papers for you.  In a contested divorce, you will need to have a trial or hearing. You will probably have many preliminary “status hearings” and conferences as you prepare for your hearing/trial. At these, you will appear before the judge and hammer out issues that will allow you to prepare for trial.  You may also have a chance for “discovery.” Discovery is the fact-finding portion of a divorce.In discovery, you can send subpoenas to people requesting documents, such as financial records. You can also have your spouse answer questions under oath. If you weren’t able to get solid proof of adultery before filing for divorce, then you can use discovery to gather additional, helpful information.  You should identify your witnesses and ask them to attend the hearing. Tell them the date, time, and location. You may also send them a subpoena, which is a legal request to show up.  You can generally get a blank subpoena form from the court clerk., You can have witnesses testify and introduce documents to convince the judge that your spouse committed adultery. In many states, you don’t actually have to prove that adultery happened. Instead, you need to prove that your spouse had the “disposition” and “opportunity” to cheat.To prove disposition, you can introduce evidence that your spouse showed affection publicly with their alleged lover. You can introduce photographs of them kissing, hugging, holding hands, etc. Or you can have witnesses testify that they observed this conduct.  To prove “opportunity,” you should introduce evidence that your spouse was seen entering their lover’s apartment late at night and not leaving until the morning. Alternately, you could show that they went away together and stayed in the same hotel.  Your spouse gets to try to prove that any conduct was innocent and not actually adultery. Depending on your state, your spouse may also argue that they are entitled to alimony even if adultery occurred.  You should be able to cross-examine any witnesses your spouse has testify. See Question Witnesses when Representing Yourself for more information.  Currently, only two states allow jury trials in divorce proceedings, so your case will likely be decided by a judge.The judge should make a decision after hearing all of the evidence. If your case is complicated, then the judge may take the case under advisement and issue a ruling at a later time.

"There is an ongoing debate among parents and experts on whether it is acceptable and safe to medicate your child (most especially babies and toddlers) to make them fall asleep when traveling by plane. Some experts quietly advise age appropriate doses of antihistamines (anti allergy) and cough medication to children.  However, the American Academy of Pediatrics’ (AAP) policy remains that oral cough and anti allergy medications should never be used for their side effects in children younger than 6 months because of adverse unwanted side effects such as confusion, difficulty urinating, dry mouth, excessive sweating, paradoxical hyperactivity, head pain, loss of appetite, nervousness, ringing in the ears (tinnitus) and stomach cramps (tummy aches)., Benadryl is made up of Diphenhydramine hydrochloride which is an antihistamine used to relieve symptoms of allergies such as rash, itching, watery eyes, itchy or runny nose, itchy throat/nose and eyes and sneezing.Benadryl has also been used to alleviate nausea and dizziness caused by motion sickness). It also helps people relax and become drowsy.  However cough and cold medications have been shown by numerous studies to be unsafe and ineffective to children younger than 6 years old and the AAP stands by the premise that experts and parents should never give Diphenhydramine hydrochloride and drugs of the similar nature to children younger than 6 – even if it is to treat actual cough and colds and allergies, much less to use it for its drowsing side effects.  In fact, studies have also shown and experts have agreed that using Benadryl or Diphenhydramine hydrochloride, has a “paradoxical” effect on toddlers and children 6 and below. Instead of making them drowsy and sleepy, the drug acts as a “super charged energy booster” and makes children hyperactive and alert.  If you are seriously thinking of administering Benadryl to your child (aged 6 and below), you must first consult with your pediatrician about the safety of giving your child this drug. Always follow the recommended dosage, and only use it as a last resort.  For children 2 years to 6 years old, the dosage is 6.25 mg orally every 4-6 hours, never exceeding 37.5 mg in 24 hours.For children 6 years to 12 years, the dosage is 12.5 mg to 25 mg by mouth every 4-6 hours, never exceeding 150 mg in 24 hours.For children older than 12 years, the dosage is 25-50 mg orally every 4-6 hours never exceeding 300 mg in 24 hours. The computed dosage is based on 1.25 mg of Benadryl to every kilo of your child’s weight.Make sure to consult with your pediatrician if you can administer the drug to your child because again, Diphenhydramine hydrochloride, like any other drug, has side effects and may have an adverse interaction with other drugs if your child is taking other medications already.  If you do decide to use Benadryl, try giving your child the recommended dose one afternoon one week prior to the scheduled trip so you know exactly how it will play out. Make sure that there are no other drugs interacting with Benadryl or the cough medication during the “trial period” and during the actual flight, so you know exactly what effect Benadryl has on your child.  Make sure to document your “findings” because really, 3,000 feet (914.4 m) up in the air is not the safest and most ideal place to have an emergency or be experimenting with medicines on your kid.  ","understand the debate regarding whether or not it is ok to give your child medications to help her sleep on planes. understand what benadryl is, and how it can make your child sleepy. be aware that parents are advised to stay away from giving children 6 or younger any medication that contains diphenhydramine hydrochloride. consult your physician before even considering giving your child benadryl. do a test run.

"For this hummus, you will need your hummus base, along with red bell peppers. You can roast the peppers yourself, or you can buy roasted red peppers in a jar. If you use the ones in a jar, use ¾ cup. If you roast them yourself, you need two whole red bell peppers.To roast the peppers, turn the oven to broil. Cut the peppers into long pieces, then put them on a baking sheet with the skin-side up. Broil them for five to 10 minutes. Then, place the peppers in a plastic reusable bag and let them cool for around 15 minutes. Afterwards, take the peppers out and remove the skins.  Add the roasted peppers to the hummus base in the food processor. Pulse the mixture together until the peppers have blended into a mostly smooth consistency.  Another delicious flavor of hummus can be made by replacing the crushed garlic in the hummus base with roasted garlic. Add to the base hummus mix four roasted garlic cloves, ¼ cup of grated parmesan cheese, and ¼ teaspoon of cumin.In the food processor, add the new ingredients to the hummus base. Pulse until there is a creamy consistency.  For a simple flavor addition to your traditional hummus base, try avocado. This adds a lot of extra nutrients and a rich, smooth flavor. Add one avocado and cilantro to the hummus base in the food processor. For guacamole hummus, you can add some tomatoes in the hummus, too.Pulse until smooth and creamy.  You can add cilantro and tomatoes on top.  For a spicy hummus, add jalapenos. Use the base hummus recipe, except switch out the lemon juice with the juice from three small limes. Add two cups of cilantro and two large chopped jalapenos. Make sure to remove the seeds.Combine the ingredients until smooth and creamy.  Gather two pounds (approximately 900 grams) of carrots and two teaspoons of cumin. Cut the carrots into small medallions and place them on a baking sheet. Cover the carrots with the cumin powder and drizzle with a tablespoon of olive oil. Roast the carrots for 20 to 25 minutes.After letting the carrots cool, place them in the food processor until they are chopped. Then add the hummus base. You can also add more cumin to taste.  Gather five cups of spinach and five ounces (approximately 142 grams) of feta cheese cubes. Add the spinach to the hummus base and combine until smooth. After this is smooth, add the feta and combine until smooth.You can add more spinach or feta to taste.

"Each length of tulle should be about 2.5 yards (2.3 m) (2.3 m).For a fuller loofah, you could create more bunches of tulle. Create an even number of bunches so that your costume will still be proportional.  The lengths do not need to be cut perfectly or with precise evenness. They should all be close to the same size, but by the time you finish, it will not matter if a few are shaped a little differently than others.  You could also use nylon matte netting instead of tulle.;  , Fold one piece of tulle in half lengthwise, essentially halving the width.  Repeat with the other pieces.  Fold one piece of tulle widthwise into thirds. The length of the tulle should be one-third of what it was.  Repeat with the other pieces.  Do not worry about making exact or perfect folds.  Pinch one piece of folded tulle in the middle and tie it in place with a small piece of 1/4-inch (0.635 cm) elastic.  You could also hold the bundle together by twisting an elastic hair band around the center.  Use your fingers to gently fluff the tulle after bundling it together.  Repeat with the remaining pieces of folded tulle.  Wrap a soft tape measure under your arms and around the fullest part of your chest.Stand in front of a mirror or ask for help from another person to make sure that the tape measure is parallel to the ground all the way around.  Bring the tape measure together in the front to make it easier for you to read the numbers.  Wrap a soft tape measure around the narrowest part of your torso.  The narrowest part of your torso is usually immediately above your belly button or somewhere in that area.  Make sure that the tape measure is completely parallel to the ground all the way around. To double-check this, continue standing in front of the mirror or getting help from another person.  Wrap the tape measure around your back and bring it together in the front.  One piece should match your bust measurement and the other should match your waist measurement.  Add roughly 4 inches (10 cm) of extra length so that you can tie the elastic together.  Tie the elastic together to form bands and trim off most of the excess on the ends.  Slip the elastic over your bust and waist to make sure that it is fits. If it is too loose or too tight, re-tie it and try again.  Knot the elastic to secure it in place.  Attach half of the tulle bundles to the bust band and the other half to the waist band.  Space the bundles along each band at even intervals. For instance, if you have four bundles on the bust band and four on the waist band, space the bundles apart in even quarters.  Attach the bundles to the band by tying a short length of 1/4-inch (0.635-cm) elastic around the center of each bundle. Tie the other end of each elastic string to the waist or bust band.  You could also attach the bundles to the band by weaving a safety pin through the tulle and into the band.  If possible, wear a strapless mini-dress or bodysuit in a color that matches the tulle.  If you cannot find a dress that matches the color of the tulle, wear one in white or black.  Short shorts and a tube top can also be worn instead of a solid dress or bodysuit. For a more conservative appearance, you could also wear tights or leggings.  Wear the bust band around the bust and the waist band around the waist.  Slide the safety pin through the tulle near its base. You may need multiple pins for each tulle bundle.  Keep the fabric of the dress or bodysuit as flat as possible as you pin it. If you gather too much fabric into the pin, you will end up causing the dress to bunch. If this happens, it may become difficult or impossible to slip the dress on.  You may need to try the dress or bodysuit on as you work to make sure that it still fits.  Make sure that there are as few empty spots as possible on the dress.  This option is preferable over the previous method if you have many small bunches of tulle. If you only have 8 to 12 bunches, either method can be used. For any more than that, however, the use of waist and bust bands is not recommended.  Fan out the tulle with your fingers, positioning the layers of each bunch so that it covers as much area as possible.  Continue picking at and fluffing the tulle bunches until you no longer notice any empty gaps. The outfit should look as 'bunched up' or 'fluffy' as a shower loofah when done.  Cut a length of white cord or rope that can fit around your neck and down to the top of the costume. Attach the rope to the top of your mini-dress, your bust band, or the top layer of tulle bunching.  Use safety pins to attach the rope. You could also attach it using a hot glue gun or a needle and thread.  To give yourself a 'wet' appearance, spray a coat of glitter spray over your arms and legs. Also spray some along your shoulders and neck.  If it is safe to use the spray on your face, apply a little to your face.  This part of the costume is only optional, but it will contribute to the shower-like or bath-like appearance.  Hair gel will make your hair look wet, while a shower cap reinforces the shower theme.  If using hair gel, wet your entire hair with the gel. Cheap gel is actually preferable because it will make your hair look wetter.  Complete the costume by wearing mesh shower slippers, plastic flip-flops, or plastic crocs.  ","cut eight large pieces of tulle. fold the tulle in half. fold each folded piece of tulle in thirds. tie each piece of tulle into a bundle. measure your bust. measure your waist. cut two pieces of elastic based on these measurements. tie and trim the elastic. tie or pin the tulle to the elastic bands. slip the bands over a mini-dress or bodysuit. alternatively, pin the tulle directly to the dress.if you want to skip the elastic bands, you can use safety pins to fix the bunches directly to the mini-dress or bodysuit. fluff up the tulle. attach a white cord or rope to the costume. spray yourself with glitter spray. put gel in your hair or wear a shower cap. wear shower shoes.

"Schnauzers are known to be friendly companions who take well to training from their owners. They are usually said to be good with children, other pets, and even enjoy time alone. They love to play and interact with their family.Their small size makes them suitable for apartment life, but their energetic personalities also make them great dogs for owners with a lot of land to roam.;  , Every breed of dog, especially purebred ones, has its own set of medical possibilities that the breed is more prone to. Spend some time reading about schnauzers and their medical history to figure out if this is the kind of dog for you.Schnauzers are typically more often affected by eye cataracts than other breeds. This can eventually lead to blindness in old age.  Schnauzers also are prone to urinary stones, pancreatitis, diabetes, and kidney disease.  Consult a veterinarian about specific problems affecting schnauzers to get all the information. Ask good questions to fully prepare yourself.  Consider if you can afford pet insurance to protect yourself from the cost of expensive veterinary treatments.  Schnauzers aren’t the highest maintenance type of dogs, but they do have a lot of energy. A schnauzer will require some significant exercise and vigorous play time from you as their owner.If you want a lapdog, a schnauzer will be happy to accommodate this, but they will also need to be exercised regularly.  Try to give your schnauzer between 30 minutes and one hour of exercise every day.  Schnauzers will also need to be groomed regularly, which is another time consideration. Their coats get matted easily, so they need to be brushed often or taken to the groomers.  When you decide to adopt a schnauzer, you should decide if you want an adult dog or a puppy. If you want to adopt a schnauzer, it will probably be easier to find an adult dog to adopt, but there may be some puppies available if you are willing to spend some time searching.  An adult dog will be less work than a puppy. They may already be housetrained and will have probably outgrown the puppy tendency to chew things up. They will probably have a calmer temperament and be less active.  Puppies sure are cute, but they also require a lot of time and energy. They will need more exercise than an older dog and more attention to ensure they don’t pee in the house or tear up your belongings. They’ll need to be housetrained and trained in obedience and require a lot of attention.  There are many schnauzer rescue agencies across the country that specialize in finding homes for this particular breed of dog. Search the internet for agencies near you and look at their listings for schnauzers currently in their care that are available for adoption.Try searching on adoptapet.com, petfinder.com, or Schnauzer Love Rescue, Inc., Once you find a schnauzer that you would like to adopt, you’ll need to fill out the adoption application with a perspective rescue agency. They will ask questions about your home, what kind of dog you’re interested in, and how much time you can devote to a dog.The application process will help the agency match you with a dog that is the right fit for you.  Most rescue agencies will require references with their application. These should come from a veterinarian or a close friend who can attest to your ability to care for a dog. If you have an existing veterinarian, ask them to write the letter so they can tell the agency about your past history as a pet owner.Some applications may require a reference from a veterinarian, so be sure to check that before you ask someone else to write your reference letter.  If you are adopting from a rescue agency, you will likely have to pay an application/adoption fee. This fee is usually applied to any vet bills the agency had to pay for routine shots, medical treatment, or just for day-to-day care of the dog.Application fees are usually around $300, depending on the agency.  Once you submit your application, it can take several weeks for a decision to be reached. The agency must ensure that you will be a suitable owner for the schnauzer in question. Don’t call the agency a million times. They will contact you when they have reached a decision.  A new dog requires a lot of supplies. You’ll need to purchase them ahead of time so that your house is ready when you bring your new schnauzer friend home. Make sure you plan ahead so that you don’t find yourself missing something when your pup arrives.You will need to purchase food, food/water dishes, collar, ID tag, leash, dog bed, and several toys and treats, and possibly a crate.  Arrange a time and place to pick up your adopted schnauzer. Make sure you agree on the time with the agency so that someone knows to be there to meet you; otherwise you might find yourself waiting around for awhile.Bring some things with you to the pick up like the dog’s collar, leash, some treats, and a comfy bed for the ride home.  Let your new schnauzer friend explore their new surroundings, but stay close to provide comfort and a feeling of safety for the pup. Be patient while your dog learns the rules of the house and how to interact in this new environment.If you have other pets already in the house, take some time to introduce them slowly so that they can get used to each other. You may have to be diligent about keeping them mostly separated for the first few days while they adjust.  ","learn about their temperament. research medical issues specific to schnauzers. consider the amount of time you can devote to a dog. choose between a puppy and an older dog. search for a schnauzer rescue agency. fill out the adoption application. provide references. pay the application fee. wait for the adoption decision. purchase all the supplies you’ll need. pick up your new schnauzer. introduce your schnauzer to their new home.

"Give your cat several minutes to sniff, look at, and check out your camera before you begin photographing. This will make her more comfortable with the equipment, so she'll be less likely to run off or be frightened by it.  Give your cat a chance to warm up to being photographed. Don't expect to immediately take amazing photographs. Your cat will probably be curious for a few minutes.;  , Your cat probably won't simply sit still while you take her portrait. Instead, give her things to play with. Consider offering her new toys to play with. If you'd like to keep her in one spot, try setting up a new stationary toy like a cat tower or post.Try giving your cat a view of something interesting. For example, offer your cat a view out of a window and scatter bird seed outside. This way, she'll be entertained by birds eating.  Treats like cat food treats or catnip can be great photography aids. Give your cat treats to reward good behavior, like sitting still for a minute. You can also give treats as a way to direct your cat's attention. For example, hold a treat near your head so your cat looks at you. This way, you can get a photo of your cat looking directly at the camera.You may want to ration out how many treats you want to give your cat before you begin taking pictures. This way, you don't accidentally give your cat too many treats throughout the session.  You might get great shots right away or you may need to take a lot of photos just to get a good one. Be sure to give your cat plenty of time and space. Your cat will feel more relaxed if you remain relaxed instead of stressing about taking the perfect shot.Have fun photographing your cat. Consider setting up a tripod to automatically take photos. This way you could play with your cat and just let the camera capture the fun you're having together.  Some cats will enjoy being photographed longer than others will. Pay attention to signs that your cat no longer wants to be the subject of your attention. If your cat seems distracted, gets angry (hisses, scratches), or tries to walk away, end the photo shoot. You probably won't get good photographs if your cat isn't cooperating, so try again later.  Never force your cat into poses. These are often unnatural for cats and can lead to injury. Always consider the needs of your cat., Consider what kind of background to use when taking a photo. If you choose a background that's bright, detailed, or distracting, your cat will be competing for the focus of the shot. If you use this kind of a background, photograph only a bit of your cat (like her tail as she runs from the frame).  For a professional-style portrait, consider using a simple white backdrop or neutral sofa. This will make your cat the focus of the image.  You can keep the background natural by just photographing outside in the yard., You can add interest to a photograph by including props or other people. For example, you might photograph your cat playing with one of her favorite toys or snuggling with a member of the family. Other props might include a pile of leaves, a cozy blanket, or baskets.  Props are a good way to let your cat's personality come through. If you have an energetic cat that's constantly moving, showing her playing with balls can illustrate that energy.  Don't forget to really think about what your cat looks like and the challenges she presents. For example, if you have a black cat, you'll need to make sure that the background you select will contrast with her dark fur. Or, realize this and make the photograph dramatic by shooting against a black background.Likewise, if you're photographing a shy cat, but need to include other cats in the photograph, don't be surprised if the shy cat tries to run off or doesn't cooperate.  If you can, photograph your cat in natural light. This way, you can avoid harsh artificial lighting. If you photograph outside, avoid bright direct light which can make difficult shadows. Instead, try to shoot around mid-morning when the light is a little softer.  If you have to shoot indoors, avoid using a flash.Your cat will probably blink and then learn to look away from the camera when you photograph her. Flash can also make your cat's eyes take on a bright red color.  Since most cats move around quickly, you'll need to make sure your camera can keep up. Set a high shutter speed so that your image won't be blurry if your cat is playing or moving.You should also consider how sharp or blurry you want the background to be and adjust your f-stop accordingly (a higher f-stop will make for a sharper image, while the lower f-stop will create a shallower depth of field).  While it's a good idea to go into the photo shoot with lots of flexibility, there may be a few images you know you want to get. Consider making a short list of images you really want to get. For example, you may want:  A close up of your cat's paws or eyes  An image of your cat sleeping  A photo of your cat grooming herself  A photograph of your cat playing or doing a trick  , As with any type of photography, you should choose a focal point when taking a picture. This could be some part of your cat or something behind your cat. For example, you could have a bright red background with your cat filling most of the frame. In this case, your cat is the focal point.  If you fill the frame with your cat, decide if you want to focus on some feature of your cat. For instance, you may do a close up of your cat's eyes or whiskers.  It's easy to start taking photos by pointing the camera down at your cat. But, for a more interesting image, get on your cat's level.You'll be able to directly photograph your cat's face, which can be great for a close up.  To get on your cat's level, you can get down on the ground or try setting her on something elevated so she's nearer to your level. Always set your cat on a safe spot where she can't injure herself.  Try shooting from a variety of places. You might start by photographing down at your cat while your cat looks up at you. Remember to shoot at your cat's level. But, you can also try raising your cat up while you get below her. This way, you can shoot up, with your cat looking down.  There's not one perfect angle for photographing cats, so try several. You won't know what angles work best until you try photographing from them., Taking posed cat portraits can be difficult, so start by letting your cat run around and play. Take candid action shots while she does this. It's a great way to let your cat's personality really shine.Make sure your shutter is set to a high speed so the image doesn't come out blurry.  Since cats are unpredictable, be prepared to take a lot of photos. Don't wait for your cat to do something interesting, or you may lose your opportunity for a great photo. Instead, plan on taking a lot of pictures. This way, you're likely to get good shots and you'll have a lot of images to work with later if you'd like to edit them.  If you can, set your camera to burst mode so that when you press the shutter, the camera takes several images spaced over a second or two.  ","let your cat check out the camera. give your cat something to do or look at. give your cat treats. be patient. know when to stop photographing. choose your background. select props. think about the specific cat you're photographing. consider the light. select a high shutter speed. decide which images you want. choose a focal point. get on your cat's level. shoot from several angles. get action shots. take lots of pictures.

"Eggs usually have one end that's smaller and pointier. Pierce the smaller end first, then the other end (top and bottom). To pierce the initial hole, use a pin or buy an egg-pricker available from specialty suppliers. The holes then need to be made bigger, so you can get the egg contents out. To do this, you can either keep using a pin or similar tool, or for a very effective method, use two large round nails, one 1/12' (2mm) thick and one 1/6' (4mm) thick. Sharpen the ends of each nail using a file or emery board to create four sharp edges. Make the hole you are going to blow through a little larger using the nail. Then make the end hole slightly larger, about twice the size of the first hole, as this is where the egg contents will flow out.  /images/thumb/e/ed/Blow-Out-Eggs-Step-1-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Blow-Out-Eggs-Step-1-preview-Version-2.jpg  /images/thumb/e/ed/Blow-Out-Eggs-Step-1-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Blow-Out-Eggs-Step-1-preview-Version-2.jpg  One way to help prevent cracking when drilling the holes in the egg is to place 'Scotch'/'cellophane' tape or an adhesive plaster/bandaid on the egg at the piercing point.  /images/thumb/3/37/Blow-Out-Eggs-Step-9-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Blow-Out-Eggs-Step-9-preview-Version-2.jpg  /images/thumb/3/37/Blow-Out-Eggs-Step-9-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Blow-Out-Eggs-Step-9-preview-Version-2.jpg  You can also pierce the egg with a little drill bit in a hand (not power) drill, small rotary tool such as a 'Dremel' or twirled between the fingers. Let it scrape down gently, not punch in and snag and tear the shell with its flutes.  The bit should be a single solid piece of metal or metal-like carbide, not covered with grit which could contaminate the extracted egg.  Feel around the eggshell for any weak spots––sometimes they are slightly gray. If you can't find any, just select a spot near the center of the egg's ends for poking holes in.  Grip the egg firmly in your non-dominant hand (but don't break it!) as you stick the nail in with your dominant hand. Insert the nail slowly and apply even pressure.  To make the shell easier to poke holes in, try rubbing the egg on fine grain sandpaper to thin the shell. This makes it easier to penetrate the shell using a heavy pin or even a paperclip. The paperclip is great to break the yolk inside, which then makes it easier to blowout.;  , Pierce the yolk and break up the membranes that keep it whole. Gently push the instrument in and out of the hole repeatedly.  /images/thumb/9/9b/Blow-Out-Eggs-Step-2-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Blow-Out-Eggs-Step-2-preview-Version-2.jpg  /images/thumb/9/9b/Blow-Out-Eggs-Step-2-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Blow-Out-Eggs-Step-2-preview-Version-2.jpg  , The traditional method uses a small straw (like those thin straws you can find in any coffee shop) and air from your mouth, but you can also use a syringe to push air into the hole. If you don't want to use your mouth, choose a tool from the following:  An ear bulb syringe  An injection syringe (without a sharp needle attached)  A glue syringe  An 'egg blower' (for example, Blas-fix).  A small air compressor, as for tire inflation or airbrushing. Attach the blunt, tapered low-pressure inflation nozzle and slowly bring it close to one hole. The egg should be disrupted and expelled without the need to break it up inside first.  Check for lubricating oil or dirt contamination in the air by directing the stream at some clean paper.  The egg may crack or even explode.  High pressure compressed air streams can be dangerous. Do not use a full-size compressor or pressurized tank, place the nozzle against the body or near the face, or allow a child to use the compressor.

"Your country's exit code + country code of the country you wish to call + area code + local telephone number.  For example, if you are placing a call from the UK to Los Angeles, CA, you would dial : 00 (exit code)-1(country code) – 323 (area code)– xxx – xxxx (local number).  For a step-by-step breakdown of this process, see the following steps.;  , This is the number that routes your call out of the country you are in. Other names for this code are the international access code or IDD International Direct Dialing code.  For the United States and Canada, the international access code is 011.  In the example above, 00 - 1 - 323 - xxx - xxxx, 00 is the exit code.  The code differs for each country. A more complete listing of the international access codes can be found here.  The country code ranges from 1 to 3 digits, and directs your call to a telecommunications circuit for the country you are calling.  For example when dialing, 00 - 1 - 323 - xxx - xxxx, '1' is the country code for the US.  A more complete listing of the country codes can be found here.  This narrows your call further to the particular state, city or town that you are calling.  Generally, area codes may range from 1 to 5 digits.  Returning to the example, in 00 -1- 323 - xxx - xxxx, 323 is the area code for Los Angeles.  This is the more familiar number that is similar to the phone numbers we dial all the time, although some countries may use more or less digits.  For some countries, many local numbers contain a “trunk prefix” that should be omitted when dialing from overseas. This number is only used within the country’s phone system.  This number is usually 1 or 0. You can search for trunk prefixes online, or simply try skipping the first number of the local number you are using if you are having trouble connecting.  In the US, the trunk code is 1, and is typically used before the area code when dialing long distance within the US. When dialing from abroad, the trunk code is omitted.  ","make your international call by following the dialing format. dial your country's exit code. dial the country code for the country you want to call. dial the area or city code. lastly, dial the local telephone number of the person you are calling.

"In general, dwarf hamsters have thickset bodies, large cheek pouches, and short tails. Make sure it does not have any nasal or eye discharge, nor any other signs of illness. Russian dwarf hamsters are particularly prone to diabetes. A hamster suffering from this condition will drink a lot of water and urinate more frequently than other dwarf hamsters.Be sure to consult your veterinarian if you suspect that your hamster has diabetes.  A recently weaned or an extremely stressed out dwarf hamster may come down with a disease called “wet tail.” Your hamster experiences diarrhea — the excessive moisture from this causes its tail to become literally wet.

"You will fight this boss inside the Eastern Palace. The idea is to stun him by shooting arrows across the center of the room when he appears after being in painting form. After you stun him, now is your chance to attack him with your sword or just continuously shoot him with arrows.  It is best just to defeat Yuga with the use of your sword because it causes more damage. This way, you will end the battle faster!;  , You will fight Moldorm in the Tower of Hera. The secret of defeating this boss is simple – attack its tail. That is the weakness you should exploit. Keep attacking the tail and son enough Moldorm will be defeated.  Be warned that each time Moldorm is hurt – it becomes faster and faster. Don’t lose your focus and just keep an eye on its tail.  In order to beat this boss, you will need to use your Tornado Rod. Simply use it stun Margomill and then spam it with sword attack directly on its eye. Keep on doing this. Even if the boss becomes bigger, targeting on the next growth to break them off. Margomill will return to its original size then. Repeat the process until you defeat the boss.  Before facing Margomill, you will have to defeat first the House of Gales mini boss. Just like Margomill, just use your Tornado Rod to stun the creature and then attack with your sword to eventually defeat it.  Yuga’s battle style will be a bit similar to the first time you encountered Yuga. Inside Hyrule Castle this time, he will still merge with the wall but with a twist - you will now be dealing with the three of them! It is up to you to figure out who’s the real Yuga. Simple enough, the real Yuga is the one who does not turn into a guard. After you find the real Yuga, follow his painting and attack him with your sword. Repeat the chase until he is defeated.  Stalbind is the Thieve’s Hideout boss. Defeating Stalbind requires patience and proper timing. He is always on guard so your task is to create an opening so you can attack him with your sword. First, you must merge with his shield and attack his back upon detaching from the shield. He will occasionally breathe poison gases so you better dodge those. When you have the chance, merge with his shield again to attack him once more. After a while he will then toss his shield and charge you with his sword. Again, dodge the attack and counterattack. He could also remove his head to haunt with his foul breath but then again, dodging should do the trick. With alternate dodging and attacking, you should win the battle eventually.  There’s a mini boss in Thieve’s Hideout that can be easily beaten with proper positioning. During the battle just stand near the door and attack the creatures with your sword. This position will prevent you from being damaged.  This battle will take place in the Dark Palace. Since it is dark, you need to light the torches in the room for you to see your foe. Gemesaur King will have an armor on so you need to destroy it first before you can do serious damage using your sword. Throwing bombs at it will weaken and eventually destroy its armor. That is your queue to attack with your sword! After a few hits, it will go berserk and blow out the torches. Just the same, re-light the torches and continue attacking it until it is defeated.  Gemesaur King’s weak spot is its head. Hit it with your sword if you have the chance.  You will fight Grinexx in Turtle Rock. Use your Ice Rod when Grinexx goes near the centers of the room. This will do some damage. It will sometimes become angry so make sure to dodge its attacks. Then it will join you on the floor and attack once more. Again, dodge his attacks and do your own sword attack targeting its head. Repeat the process and this boss will fall eventually.  Knucklemaster is virtually a giant armor hand that you need to defeat in Skull Woods. It has a giant eye on its palm which will be your main target when you attack. It has a devastating punch so be alert to merge with the wall when it attacks. It will be stunned after missing the hit. This is your chance to attack it with your sword. After a few more damages, it will turn purple and attempt to squash you! Again, simply merge with the wall or run around the room to dodge its attack resulting into a stun. Keep on attacking Knucklemaster while it’s stunned and it will be defeated soon enough.  Zaganaga is the boss in Desert Palace. In order to beat Zaganaga, your main goal is to raise the sand in order to reach its position. It will create little flying creatures that will delay your sand raising but these creatures are mere annoyances since they can easily be beaten. Zaganaga will also spew sand around the room but don’t let this interfere with your main goal. When you finally reach Zaganaga, attack it with your sword and you will eventually win the battle.  This battle will take place in Ice Ruins. That being said, the environment of this match will be a bit tricky. Since you’re surrounded with ice, it’s obvious that your Fire Rod will definitely come in handy in this battle. You will be able to attack Dharkstare after melting some ice around you. Watch out for the triangles that this boss creates and stay away from orbs when they glow white! Focus on melting ice and attacking and soon you will beat Dharkstare.  There’s also a mini boss in Ice Ruins. Well, mini bosses technically. They are a group of penguins! The technique in beating them is by going after the small ones first.  Arrghus is the Swamp Palace boss. This battle is easier than it looks like. Your main goal is to pull Arrghus’ eyes out and attack the eyes with your sword to kill them. Just keep on doing this until all its eyes are gone. Now it will be easier for you to dodge its laser attacks and counterattack with your sword. Repeat this pattern until the boss is defeated.  You can merge with the wall during laser attacks to dodge it more effectively.  The mini boss in Swamp Palace is quite easy to defeat. All you need to do is dodge its electric projectiles and throw skulls at it. When it splits into two – just attack each of them with your sword and the should do the trick.  This battle takes place inside Lorule Castle. This battle is pretty exhausting since there are no obvious shortcuts in winning. Yuga has now merged with Ganon. You really must rely on timing your dodges and counterattacks. You just have to keep on doing this pattern until Yuga does new attacks such as throwing its weapon towards you and occasionally vanishing at times. Again, just dodge the attacks and take advantage of the openings to deal your own damage. This will defeat Yuga eventually.  You need to face Yuga again for the second time! This battle starts with a tennis match. After you hit Yuga – Princess Zelda will give you the Bow of Light. With this weapon equipped, you can now damage Yuga while merged to the wall. This will force him to detach from the painting and you can now attack him in his physical form with your Master Sword. At this point, Yuga will spawn a bunch of enemies and obstacles just to protect himself from you. Simply dodge these and shoot Yuga with the Bow of Light each time you have the chance. Take advantage the opportunity to damage him with your Master Sword when he is out of the painting. Keep on doing this routine until you defeat Yuga.

"In order to truly focus on getting to know your boyfriend better, pick the right setting to have a deep conversation. Avoid a noisy bar or restaurant or talking at a time when one of you will be busy. Instead, choose to have a nice talk while on a walk through the park, during a picnic, or while sitting out on the porch looking at the stars.;  , To get to know your boyfriend fully, first find out how his earliest years were. Ask him where he grew up, about his siblings, his relationships with his parents, and his friends when he was a kid. Ask him his favorite memory and his worst memory from his childhood. This will help you get a general feel for the major events that occurred while he was growing up., Ask your beau questions about the schools he’s been to, his experiences there, and his current job. Find out if he enjoys his job or if he wants to change careers or go back to school.Ask him what his ideal job or college would look like.  You might say something like “So, tell me about your job now. What do you like best about it? And what do you wish you could change?”  , You can also really get to know a person by finding out what kind of entertainment they enjoy. You might even find out that you have more in common than you thought. Find out what books he enjoyed most or could read over and over. See if any films have made him cry. Find out what concerts he’s been to or ones he’d like to go to.You can try saying “When I was a kid, I remember reading To Kill a Mockingbird and it really changed my life. Do you have any books that affected you like that?”  , During this process, be sure that you are fully engaged in the conversation. You cannot get to know someone if you are not paying attention to them. Put your phone down and truly listen. Laugh with him, cry with him, kiss him, and nod to show that you are paying attention.Respect his privacy if he doesn’t want to talk about certain topics.

"The flu vaccine that is currently used for seasonal flu will not work against any Chemical or Biological Attack. New strains of the virus require new vaccines, and these can take months or years to develop and even longer to produce and distribute on a large scale.;  , Should a pandemic of any kind flare up, the World Health Organization (WHO), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and other governmental and non-governmental organizations will provide information on the spread of the disease, as well as updates on vaccines or other medications, tips for keeping yourself safe, and travel advisories. The WHO and CDC, as well as various national governments, already have websites in place to provide useful planning information to the public. Newspapers and TV and radio broadcasts will also help disseminate critical warnings and advice.  While the current vaccine won't protect you from every flu or any other 'new' strains of the virus, it can help you stay healthy (by protecting you some flu virus strains), which may in turn help your body to fight the virus better if you do become infected.  In past Chemical or Biological pandemics, many victims succumbed to secondary pneumonia infection. While the pneumonia vaccine cannot protect against all types of pneumonia, it can improve your chances of surviving the pandemic. The vaccine is especially recommended for people over the age of 65 or those who have chronic illnesses such as diabetes or asthma.  Two antiviral medications, Tamiflu and Relenza, have shown the potential to effectively prevent and treat avian flu. These are both available only by prescription and will probably be effective only if taken before infection or very shortly afterward. It should be noted that additional testing is necessary to determine how effective these drugs really are against avian flu. Furthermore, mutations in the avian flu virus may render them ineffective in time.  Hand washing may be the single most powerful defense against avian influenza and many other infectious diseases. If pandemic strikes, you should wash your hands several times a day. Make sure that you use proper hand washing technique.  Since it's probably not feasible to wash your hands every time you touch something that may carry the virus, you should carry an alcohol-based hand cleaner with you at all times. These cleaners come in a variety of forms, and can be used any time you need a quick touch-up. Keep in mind, however, that the use of these cleaners is not a substitute for thoroughly washing your hands, and they should only be used to supplement hand washing.  Right now, the only documented way to become infected with avian influenza is by coming into contact with infected birds or poultry products, and these routes of infection will continue even if the virus mutates so that human-to-human transmission becomes the greatest threat. Avoid handling any thing the infected has already touched, and try to prevent domestic animals (such as house cats/dogs) from coming into contact with Infected. If you work in proximity the dead or living infected, for example--take precautions such as wearing gloves, respirators, and safety aprons. Cook all foods thoroughly, to 165 °F (74 °C) throughout, and exercise proper food-handling techniques, as you would to protect yourself from other threats such as salmonella. Proper cooking kills the most virus.  The most effective way to prevent becoming infected is to avoid exposure to infected people. Unfortunately, it's not possible to determine who is infected and who is not--by the time symptoms appear, a person is already contagious. Social distancing, deliberately limiting contact with people (especially large groups of people), is a reasonable precaution to take in the event of a pandemic.  If you're sick or if others at your workplace have become sick, you should stay away from your workplace even in the absence of a pandemic. Given that people will generally be infected and contagious before they exhibit symptoms, however, during a pandemic it's essential to stay away from places, such as work, where you have a high probability of being exposed to an infected person.  A pandemic can last for months or even years, and waves of intense local outbreaks can last for weeks, so it's not like you can just take a few sick days to protect yourself from workplace infection. If possible, try to arrange a work-from-home situation. A surprising variety of jobs can now be accomplished remotely, and employers will likely be willing--or even required--to try this out if a pandemic strikes.  Any parent knows that kids pick up all kinds of bugs at school. Avoid public transportation. Buses, planes, boats, and trains place large numbers of people in close quarters. Public transportation is the ideal vehicle for widespread spread of infectious disease.  During a pandemic, governments may cancel public events, but even if they don't, you should probably stay away from them. Any large gathering of people in close proximity creates a high-risk situation.  The most virus can be spread through the air, so in the event of a pandemic it's a good idea to protect yourself from inhalation of the virus if you're out in public. While surgical masks only prevent the wearer from spreading germs, respirators (which often look like surgical masks) protect the wearer from inhaling germs. You can buy respirators that are designed for one-time use, or you can buy reusable ones with replaceable filters. Use only respirators labeled as 'NIOSH certified,' 'N95,' 'N99,' or 'N100,' as these help protect against inhalation of very small particles. Respirators only provide protection when worn properly, so be sure to follow the instructions exactly--they should cover the nose, and there should be no gaps between the mask and the side of the face.  Gloves can prevent germs from getting on your hands, where they can be absorbed directly through open cuts or spread to other parts of your body. Latex or nitrile medical gloves or heavy-duty rubber gloves can be used to protect the hands. The gloves should be removed if torn or damaged, and hands should be thoroughly washed after removal of gloves.  Some Illnesses can be spread if contaminated droplets (from a sneeze, or spit, for example) and then enter the eyes or mouth. Wear glasses or goggles to prevent this from occurring, and avoid touching your eyes or mouth with your hands or with potentially contaminated materials.  Gloves, masks, tissues, and other potential bio-hazards should be handled carefully and disposed of properly. Place these materials in approved bio-hazard containers or seal them in clearly marked plastic bags.  If a pandemic strikes, many of the basic services we take for granted, such as electricity, phone, and mass transit, may be disrupted temporarily. Widespread employee absenteeism and massive death tolls can shut down everything from the corner store to hospitals.  Discuss emergency preparation with your family. Make a plan so that children will know what to do and where to go if you are incapacitated or killed, or if family members cannot communicate with each other.  In the developed world, at least, food shortages and disruption of services will likely not last more than a week or two at a time. Still, it's essential to be prepared for such an event. Store a two-week supply of water for everyone in your household. Keep at least 1 gallon (3.8 L) per person per day in clear plastic containers.  Opt for non-perishable foods that don't need to be cooked and that don't require a lot of water to prepare.  , The effectiveness of antiviral medications decreases as the illness progresses, so prompt medical treatment is imperative.

"The key to focus is, rather obviously, the ability to drown out distractions. Since the average office worker is distracted once every 3 minutes, it’s important to eliminate distractions before beginning a task.Such awareness will go a long way toward gaining focus.  Tune out distractions by removing brightly colored images out of your field of vision, such as on a computer screen. Some people find that removing the dock (the bar at the bottom of the screen) from the desktop helps with focus.Get comfortable before performing a task. Discomfort will draw attention away from what you’re trying to do.  Put away your phone. If you don’t have any calls or texts scheduled for a block of time, turn it off before you start a new task.;  , Not only that, but this one-at-a-time philosophy ensures that you move more slowly through your day, preventing careless mistakes. You can keep yourself from committing to too many tasks at once by prioritizing your tasks at the beginning of the day.  If you’re in a setting with too many people or objects and you can’t get a task completed, it’s time to find a new spot. Moving off by yourself when you’re in a crowd automatically reduces the number of distractions in your vicinity. And if it’s possible, take a walk or get in the car and relocate to an entirely new place. Such movement will change your perspective and remove distractions.  White noise is that fuzzy sound we hear on the radio when switching between stations. It’s a simple sound that literally drowns out noise, isolating you in pretty much any environment. Some apps and websites provide white noise generators, but you can also purchase machines that look like alarm clocks that do the same thing. In a pinch, a fan or blow dryer can accomplish the same goal.  Research has varied results when testing white noise.Experiment with your own preferences while taking notice of your stress levels and ability to focus., If you’re in a setting conducive to wearing headphones—an office job, the gym, public transport, etc.—putting on a set is the perfect way to focus on a task. Not only can you turn on any noise you need, it’s a signal to others that you want to be left alone.  For example, headphones are the perfect place to turn on white noise, music, even a podcast. Just make sure your music isn’t distracting and that your podcast isn’t too interesting!  , Playing memory card games like we did when we were kids is a good place to start, but you might want to move on to more complicated puzzles like you can find in smartphone apps like Luminosity.  Look for challenging individual puzzles that you can play when you have downtime. It’s especially helpful to search for puzzle apps and install them on your phone.  Real-life games are also good for your brain. The daily crossword and Sudoku are a challenge, and traditional puzzles work too—the higher the piece count, the more the challenge!  , Adding reading into your daily routine can slow down memory loss in old age. When you read, you are triggered to imagine things outside your experience, which keeps your brain active. Reading also relaxes a busy mind because it creates something to focus on. , It‘s tempting to use a calculator for even simple math—after all, every cell phone and computer has one built in. But performing math in your head boosts your working memory, the part of your brain that stores memories for immediate use., When you don’t have a schedule to follow each day, your mind struggles to balance daily tasks. You lose focus because you’re trying to remember all the things you need to accomplish, which results in forgetting your tasks. A regular schedule can eliminate this struggle.  Storing your to-do list on paper instead of in your head frees up space in your brain for focus and memory. Write down your schedule at the beginning of each day.  Eat at regular intervals. If your mind can depend on specific mealtimes, you won’t be distracted by an urge to find food.  Healthy eating is good, but there are actually specific foods that boost your memory. They include, not surprisingly, vegetables—green ones—as well as berries, cherries, walnuts, and foods containing omega-3 fatty acids.Dark green veggies like broccoli and leafy greens have been shown to assist in memory retention. Cabbage, though lighter in color, is also on the list.  Omega-3 fatty acids improve a host of cognitive functions such as depression, mental health, and memory. You can find them in algae and fatty fish, like salmon and sardines. They are even being studied to determine their role in reversing brain function loss due to aging., Adults need 7.5 to 9 hours of sleep every night to steer clear of sleep deprivation.Lack of sleep results in loss of sharpness not only in memory, but creativity, problem solving, and critical thinking. You really do focus better if you get enough sleep!  , Go to bed and get up at the same time everyday (even days off). A sleep routine regulates REM sleep, when your body does most of its repairing.Turn off the TV long before bedtime. Stimulation from a TV or computer screen keeps your mind busy instead of helping it shut down for the night.  Take a bath before bed. A drop in body temperature triggers the need for sleep; adding aromatherapy products (candles, oils, etc.) may increase this effect.Stop reading in bed. Again, doing something that stimulates the brain right before bed does not help you get in sleep mode, especially in the space where you need your mind to switch off quickly.  Physical exercise can actually improve memory. One study at the University of British Columbia found that different types of memory are bulked up by different types of exercise, whether weight training or aerobic.You already knew exercise is good for the body overall, but now you know that if you want to improve your memory, you’ve got to get moving.  Develop a weekly exercise routine. Start small and gradually increase both the frequency and duration of workouts.  Join a gym and incorporate weekly visits into your schedule. Most gyms have a staff of personal trainers who can tailor a workout to your needs.  Grab a friend to help you stay motivated. Knowing someone is waiting on you for their weekly workout will help you get out the door.  ","tune out distractions. limit multitasking.performing one task at a time is a sure way to hone your focusing skills. change your environment. try white noise. wear headphones. do puzzles.games create new pathways in your brain and keep it sharp, especially puzzles. read more.simply put, reading is stimulating for the mind. calculate math problems in your head. follow a schedule. eat for your brain. get enough sleep. establish a bedtime routine. work out.

"It sounds messy, and it IS messy. But inserting yogurt into your vagina is a way of re-populating the vagina with harmless bacteria that may be able to “crowd out” the parasite. However, there are no scientific studies that indicate this. , , , Use plain yogurt and a 10 mL syringe (you can buy this syringe at your local pharmacy).  Every night, fill the syringe with the plain yogurt and fill your vagina by inserting the syringe and depressing the plunger.  Go to bed as usual, but wear a sanitary pad. The messiness comes in the morning when you get out of bed. You should also wear a thin pad during the day.  Repeat every night until the symptoms disappear.  You can also use a tampon coated with yogurt, but tampons without the applicator can be difficult and uncomfortable to insert.  A probiotic will help replenish good bacteria in your body. , , Probiotic capsules can be expensive and can be found in most groceries and drugstores. Use gelcap suppositories, since hard suppositories may not be as effective. Buy a brand that has Bifidobacterium longum; Lactobacillus rhamnosus; Bifidobacterium infantis; Lactobacillus acidophilus; or Lactobacillus reuteri HA-188.  There is not a lot of evidence showing if probiotics as a supplement or in yogurt are helpful in preventing trichomoniasis.  Use Curasept periodontal gel and apply in and around the vagina. Curasept contains 0.5% cyclohexadiene, a disinfectant which has been shown to be effective in treating BV., A whole clove of peeled garlic can be inserted into the vagina and has been reported to be helpful in treating BV. .This is because the garlic contains allicin, which is a natural antibiotic that fights BV.  Peel a clove of garlic. Poke some holes in the garlic so that the allicin can be released. Insert the clove into your vagina. Replace the garlic every four hours for seven days or until symptoms have disappeared. , Boric acid can be irritating, so you shouldn’t make your own suppository. Do not directly apply it to the vagina. Look for Vitanica Yeast Arrest, found in many health food stores. This product is specially formulated for vaginal yeast infections.Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for proper usage.  You must not be the recipient of oral sex while using boric acid because boric acid is poisonous to your partner.  ","try plain yogurt. replenish good bacteria with a probiotic suppository. use periodontal gel. try a clove of garlic. treat a yeast infection with a boric acid suppository. "
"If you don't have it, you can go to the General Store and pay 480 G for it.  You can get it by fishing at the following places during the Spring, Summer, and Autumn:  The seawall, lighthouse, boat dock, and beach at Harmonica Town  The southwest shore of Clarinet District  , Ensure that your rucksack is not full, or else you cannot grill the fish., Use your matches on a wood stack. Press the 'A' button., Press the 'A' button again and 'Start' to make the dish.  ","acquire matches. get a sea bream. have the sea bream in your rucksack. start a bonfire. choose the sea bream that you need for the recipe. "
"If there is a potential move, especially on short notice, make sure you are prepared for that eventuality. Everything that you can prepare ahead of time will be that much less that you have to prepare when the time comes. Problems with your visa may cause delays in your ability to go.  Make sure your passport is current. If you need a new one, that is the first order of business. It can take several weeks to apply for and receive a new passport.;  , Before all else, draw up a plan that can be checked off as things are done. This plan needs to be thorough and it should include deadlines. Here are some other considerations:  Discussing the packing and shipping arrangements. Interview at least three different companies and get their quotes for the move. Find out what each company is prepared to do: specialized packing, dealing with your wine cellar (this can be problematic), helping with pets, timing guarantees, storage at the other end, etc. Also, discuss the possibility of storing possessions in your current country. If this move is short-term and you intend to return, it might be best to leave some—or even most—items behind.  Deciding what to do with your current home if you own it. Are you going to sell it or rent it out? If selling, talk to a real estate agent and tell them about your plans. Ask yourself if you have time to wait for the best offer, or you need to sell quickly to get the money. Be careful how you convey this to your agent—you still want the best price, whatever your hurry.  If renting it out, interview agents responsible for rental properties and be sure you are one hundred percent happy with their services. Ask for references and if possible, favor an agent used to renting out properties for overseas landlords—it's much harder to be an overseas landlord and much can go wrong in your absence if the agent fails to meet their basic obligations of checking the properly regularly and vetting tenants properly.  Dealing with mortgages, leases and loans. You will need to talk to your bank or other lenders about handling these financial obligations most effectively.  Talking to your children's schools about the upcoming change. You will need evidence of your children's current level of schooling, as well as a guarantee of willingness to be emailed or phoned by the school in your new country, if relevant. Ask the guidance counselor about any transition issues you might find useful.  Vaccinations and visas. Be sure that you are up-to-date with relevant vaccinations and obtain all visas. Sort out any accompanying documentation needed for a permanent or long-term move.  If you're planning on renouncing your citizenship of your current country and taking on new citizenship, this will take considerable time, so start working on this from the beginning of your planning.  Developing a timeline for packing. Follow this with dedication, as it can give you plenty of time to deal with things that go wrong—and they will!  , Some corporations and government entities that send their staffs overseas are quite happy to give anything from a few months to a few days notice that you are handpicked to move overseas. In this case, ask for as much help as they are willing to pay for—you will need it.  If you do have the luxury of your own timeline, give yourself at least six months. You will need every moment of this time to tie up many loose ends, including dealing with your property, car, pets, insurance, packing, and shipping, banking, educational transitions and more. In some cases, you may not have this luxury.  It is possible to move quickly, so if this has been thrust on you, try not to despair. However, do immediately spend time creating networks of helpers. You really need as many hands on deck as you can gather.  Will you stay in hotel or serviced apartment accommodation while looking for a place to buy or rent?  It is not recommended that you buy a place over the internet. Unseen, you could buy something terrible. You need to be on location to get a sense of the neighborhood, to see the dry rot at the base of the house, to realize that it is overpriced!  One way around this is for you or one family member to do a forward visit, to check out real estate to see what's on offer and whether anything is a good deal. You may also know somebody in your new country who can be your eyes and ears.  Even if you want to buy a house or apartment in the new country, it is recommended that you begin by renting. Renting gives you a quick out if you choose the wrong location or you simply do not like being in the new country. After at least six months, you will have a better idea of wanting to stay or not, plus a much better understanding of the real estate and preferred areas to live. This means less pressure for you and a greater likelihood of making the right decision.  Be aware that you will initially be without your shipped goods. This makes living in a hotel or a serviced apartment initially a good choice.  Get a good lawyer when dealing with purchase of property in another country. You will need someone on your side who understands all the taxes, fees, liens, caveats, etc that the country you're moving to has in store. Your current attorney may be able to give you a recommendation for an attorney in your new country.  It is becoming easier to transfer money between many countries without giving up too much in processing fees. Talk to your current bank to explore the options for setting up transfers—some banks even allow transfers to overseas accounts via cell phones, so look into all the options.  Unless you are planning to never return to your current country, it is advisable to keep at least one bank account open in your current country. The longer you have an account open, the better your credit standing. When you do return, it is easier to start where you left off than to have to open new accounts. Internet banking makes it easier for you to monitor the account in the country you have left.  In some countries, accessing money will be a lot harder than in others. Be sure to discuss the challenges and solutions with your bank and a reputable financial adviser with knowledgeable about the country that you are moving to.  They can be an invaluable source of help if you need information, support, and connection. Let them know about your plans and it is likely that they will do what they can to ensure that you get the information you need.  It is a reality that we need very little to live and yet our houses tend to be overstuffed with consumables we have accumulated over the years, much of which we do not use or need. Rather than dragging all this stuff with you, or paying to keep it in storage, do an honest appraisal of the need for keeping much of your belongings. Where possible, donate and give away the items you do not need. It is far better to travel light and not have to worry about items in storage than to burden yourself  , Use online auction sites ad-listing websites to get rid of your items. Even if you are pressed for time, this can be a great way to sell items in bulk, even whole roomfuls. Tell people that you are moving overseas and that it all has to go. People love to grab a bargain!  Be ruthless. Every thing added means greater costs in shipping.  Occasionally, shipping containers fall overboard, while damage can occur to goods at any stage of transit due to rough handling and other mishaps. Bear this in mind when lugging your antique collection of whatnots with you––it may be better to place in storage or to sell and have the cash. Become adequately insured for any mishaps during shipping.  For some people, this means giving them to a friend or family member to care for. For others, it means taking them with you. If you are taking your pets with you, consider the following:  Is your pet allowed in the country you are headed to?  Will your pet undergo quarantine? For how long and at what cost?  How will your pet travel? Find out about safety, costs, and all requirements, such as pet passports.  How is your pet's health? Your pet needs to be thoroughly vaccinated and medically fit to travel. There may be other requirements of the country of destination too––check.  Consider your pet's frailty when making the decision. Taking an old or disabled pet with you may be too much trauma for the pet.  Some countries are happy to accept your existing one from another country or to accept an international driver's license. Others want you to take their local tests after a set time. Avoid waiting to find out––it can be hard to be without your ability to drive in a new place.  If you are not already traveling for the place you work at, you will need to abide with their policies on resignation. Be sure to plan in plenty of time to tell them. However, unless there is something obviously affecting your place of work because of the planning, it is not recommended to inform them until later in your planning. This is in case you change your mind or your place of work thinks about shifting you out earlier than what you might have counted on.

"Talk with your doctor about whether you have normal testosterone levels. Testosterone has a peculiar relationship to hair loss. Not enough testosterone and your chest hair won't grow.Too much and it gets converted into DHT, which shrinks hair follicles.Try to have a healthy balance of testosterone; of course, because there's no testosterone test available over the counter, you'll need to seek the advice of a doctor.  Start working out. Both weight loss and weightlifting can boost a man's testosterone levels.Hit the gym, back up onto the bench press, and do some serious exercise. You'll feel stronger and grow some chest hair while you're at it.  Take testosterone supplements if your doctor diagnoses you with low-T. Only take supplements if your doctor has diagnosed you. Again, if you have normal levels of testosterone and you take supplements, an enzyme will convert the excess testosterone into a follicle-shrinking hormone. Not a good recipe for hair growth.  Talk to your doctor about estrogen inhibitors. Your doctor should know if you taking estrogen inhibitors is advisable for chest hair growth in your specific case.;  , Anabolic steroids pose serious health hazards. As there are dozens, if not hundreds, of different anabolic and androgenic steroids, each with different side-effects on the body and implications for your hair, it's not considered safe to use steroids for hair growth.  If you have any chest hair already, shaving will help it get thicker, not help hair grow where it isn't. (This one of the reasons girls wax instead of shave.) Shaving cuts the hair at its root, where it's thickest; when it grows out, the hair will be thicker for its whole length. See How to Shave Chest Hair.  Shave your chest every 2-4 weeks.  In the mornings, after a shower, massage the chest area with Daktarin. This method has been reputed to stimulate the growth of new hair, although not medically verified.  Note: Miconazol Nitrate is a fungus-busting crème used to treat foot and vaginal infections. Use in moderation, and with caution.  Rub the onion onto your chest using a circular motion. Once the surface of the onion is dry, cut about 5mm of the onion and continue; this can stimulate hair growth because onions contain sulfur, a mineral known to help with hair growth.  This method should probably not be used during the day, because of the smell. So let it do it's work during the night, and shower the next morning.  It may be embarrassing, but ask someone you trust about their own experience growing chest hair.  If the male relative wants to know why, you have two options:  Tell the truth, mention your intention of growing chest hair and maybe they can let you in on their secrets. You may have nothing to worry about.  Just say that you were wondering and wanted to talk about something random.  The growth will probably only start after about two weeks and will be only dramatically noticeable after some time. Be patient and stick with your treatment. It may not necessarily seem this way, but there are many more important things in life than chest hair, so chin up!  , There are some well-intentioned myths out there about how to grow hair and what it takes to have a manly mane. Many of them have been debunked by science and are demonstrably false.  Increasing blood flow doesn't increase hair growth.Maybe you've been told to brush your chest with a toothbrush to increase the blood flow to the area, which is supposed to stimulate growth. It's not scientifically true. Brushing your chest will not get you chest hair.  Unclogging pores won't help you grow hair. Some say that blocked pores can cause hair to be trapped beneath the surface of the skin, and that the secret to hair growth is simply unclogging those pores. It's simply not true. While scrubbing away dead skin and unclogging pores is definitely a good thing, it won't help stimulate chest hair growth.

"Various types of containers will work, as long as there is proper ventilation. If you want a container you can observe well, use a large, clean glass jar or other clear container. Poke some holes into the lid, or cover the top of the jar with a fine mesh fabric secured with a rubber band.Your container should be ready before you get the worms, because worms shouldn’t be exposed to the light for long. You’ll want their moist, dark home ready for them when you collect them.;  , Put one centimeter of sand in the bottom of your container. Add a thick layer of damp soil, and another centimeter of sand on top of that. Then fill the jar with moist soil up to five centimeters from the top of the container. In a separate container, prepare the top layer you will put on top of the worms once you have them.The topmost layer can include pieces of overripe fruit (such as grapes), vegetable peels and leaves (from trees and/or tea).  You can search for or buy earthworms or tiger worms (redworms). Places you can catch worms are compost piles, gardens, or under rocks or leaf piles. Check the grass, sidewalk or driveway after a lot of rain. If you can’t find worms yourself, you can buy them at a local tackle shop.Keep your hands moist when handling worms.  Place the worms right onto the topmost (food) layer in the container.  Store the container in a cool, dark place such as a cupboard.Put thought into where you keep your wormery. Worms like a place without vibrations.Wrap the container with black paper and secure it with string or a rubber band. Put on the ventilated lid.  For example, don’t keep your wormery near a furnace, speaker, refrigerator or dishwasher.  If you’re keeping the container outside, choose a garage or shed, and wrap the container in bubble wrap as insulation, without covering the ventilated lid.

"Before you begin designing your maze, you will need to think about what you are hoping to learn from it. Different styles of mazes will challenge your mouse in different ways and teach you different things about its behavior.You may want to see how fast your mouse can complete the maze and whether or not its performance improves over time. In this case, you would want to build a maze with only one end-point.  You may want to gain insight into your mouse's habits or preferences. In this case, you would want to build a maze with two or more end-points so that your mouse can choose which one it prefers.;  , Once you've decided what you want to learn about your mouse from the maze, you can choose the style of maze that best meets your needs. There are five basic designs to choose from for your maze, and you can customize them from there.If you want to build a maze with one end-point, you have two basic designs to choose from. You can build a classic maze, which is rectangular and has a series of paths, some of which turn into dead-ends. With this design, it is possible for the mouse to have more than two choices at each intersection. Alternatively, you could build a large maze that consists of several interconnected T shapes. With this design, the mouse must choose to turn either right or left at every point where one T connects to another. One choice always leads to the next T and the other always leads to a dead-end, which makes it very simple to calculate how many mistakes the mouse makes along the way.  If you want to build a maze with multiple end-points, you can build a T-shaped maze, a Y-shaped maze, or a maze with several radial arms (which will end up looking like the spokes on a wheel).  Some mazes are simple and consist of just a few twists and turns, while others are much more complicated. Consider whether you want to start out small and give your mouse an easy maze, or if you want to challenge it with a much more complicated design.If you are building a maze with a single end-point, you can make it more challenging by adding lots of different branches and dead-ends along the way. Your maze can have has many twists and turns as you like, as long as there is a way to get out.  If you are building a maze with multiple end-points, you can make it more challenging by making the corners sharper. T-shaped mazes are generally tougher for mice to navigate than Y-shaped mazes. You could also consider adding more than two arms to your maze.  Once you've settled on a basic design for your maze, start drawing so you know exactly how you want to lay it out. Your initial drawing does not need to be to scale; it just needs to be an accurate representation of where the different paths will lead.  Once you're done with your drawing, double-check that the maze really does have a solution. You wouldn't want to put your mouse in an impossible-to-solve maze.  Start with a flat piece of cardboard that is the same size as the maze you want to build. This will be the floor of your maze.If you are starting with a cardboard box, you may be able to leave the sides in place so that you won't have to attach exterior walls later on.  Now that you know exactly how big your maze will be, it's time to draw out your design on the piece of cardboard that will be the floor of the maze. Drawing your design out will make it much easier to assemble the maze.Consider using a pencil so you can erase your lines if you make a mistake.  Make sure the paths are all wide enough for your mouse to fit through.  Use a separate piece of cardboard to construct the walls of your maze. You will need to measure the length of each wall, use your scissors or knife to cut a piece of cardboard to the appropriate length, and secure it in place with hot glue. Do this for the interior walls (which you marked with pencil) and the exterior walls, along the entire perimeter of your maze.It may be easier to start from the center and work your way out so that you don't need to lean over the exterior walls in order to attach the interior ones.  Make sure all of your walls, both interior and exterior, are the same height.  You can use other types of glue as well, but hot glue is a good choice because it dries very quickly. Be sure to hold the wall in place until the glue begins to harden.  Run a bead of glue along the corners where two walls meet as well. This will provide extra stability.  In order to motivate your mouse to find the end of the maze and reward it for solving the puzzle, place some kind of a reward at the end. Rewards are usually food, like unsweetened cereal or peanut butter.If you're using a maze with multiple end-points, you may want to add two different rewards. For example, you could place cereal at one end and peanut butter at the other end to find out which one your mouse prefers.  In some cases, you may not want to add a reward. If, for example, you want to test whether your mouse has an innate preference for turning right or left, you would probably want to let it run the maze a few times with no reward.  It's a good idea to add some kind of transparent lid to your maze to prevent the mouse from climbing over the walls. You can use a piece of hardware cloth or a thin sheet of plexiglass with some holes for ventilation.Whatever you use, make sure it is transparent enough that you can still see the mouse through it, and that it is ventilated so your mouse has plenty of air.  The top doesn't need to be secured in any way. Just rest it on top of the maze so it's easy to remove it when it's time to put your mouse inside. If you find that your mouse pushes up on the top to try to escape, you can put some pressure on it with your hand or place something else on top of it (like a book, for example).  If you add a top, be sure the walls are high enough so that your mouse can easily navigate the paths without being squished. If you choose not to put a top on your maze, you should build your walls extra high to discourage the mouse from trying to climb out.  If you want your maze to be extra sturdy, you can use wood for your floor and walls instead of cardboard. You will build your maze the same way, but you will need to use a saw to cut your wood to the appropriate size and construction adhesive to hold the walls in place.A wooden maze will last much longer than a cardboard maze because mice can easily chew through cardboard.  If you are using a material that's heavier than cardboard, it's very important to make sure that the walls are sturdy so that they won't fall down and injure your mouse. You may want to use some screws or nails in addition to your adhesive.  Another fun and easy way to build a maze is to use interlocking building blocks. Simply stack them on top of each other to create whatever pattern you want.This works especially well if you have a base plate for your building blocks that is the same size as the maze you want to build. This will help ensure that your walls don't fall over.  If you choose this method, you probably won't want to draw your design on the base. That's fine because there's no glue involved, so you can easily change the location of your blocks if you make a mistake.  If you want to be able to change the layout of your maze frequently without using blocks, consider attaching Velcro strips to the bottoms of your interior walls and to the floor instead of gluing the walls in place. If you choose this modification, you will still use cardboard as your main building material.  You will probably have to add more Velcro to the floor if you want to change the location of the walls.  Consider adding Velcro to the sides of your walls as well so that they stick to each other. This will provide extra stability in case your mouse leans against the wall.  No matter what you built your maze out of, you can decorate it to make it a little more personal. Use your imagination to make your maze just the way you want it.  If you used cardboard, you could glue colorful construction paper to the outsides of the maze and decorate it with stickers and markers.If you used wood, you could paint the maze or draw directly on the wood with markers.  If you used blocks, you probably won't want to apply glue or paint to them, but you could still use construction paper to decorate the outsides by simply taping it in place.  ","think about the purpose of your maze. choose the type of maze you want to build. decide how challenging you want your maze to be. draw out your maze design. construct the platform. draw your maze design on the floor. cut out and attach the walls. place a reward at the end of the maze. add a lid. consider using wood. try using blocks. use velcro instead of glue. decorate your maze.

"It is best to apply a heat pack or wrap about a half-hour before any physical activity. Then, when you are done, ice the area or apply a cold wrap immediately and keep it going for about 20 minutes. This will reduce swelling and allow your knee to heal.Even during rest days it can be therapeutic to ice your knee for 20 minutes every 3 hours or so. Be careful with putting ice directly on your skin as it can cause burns. Use a wrap or ice pack., Analgesics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, can help to reduce swelling and minimize pain. They may not shorten your period of healing overly much, but they can make your more comfortable during the process. Make sure to follow any dosing directions carefully., If you decide to continue with sports, then you may need to wear shock-absorbent insoles in your shoes. This will minimize the pressure placed on your knees. When playing a sport that requires kneeling or bending, like wrestling, then it’s a good idea to wear fitted pads to protect your knees.Just any insoles or knee pads won’t do. Buy yours at a sporting goods store to make sure that they will hold up will with lots of movement.  Casts are usually only used in the most severe cases of OSD with adults. Most OSD patients are given a brace, such as a stabilizing knee wrap or patella strap, for optional use during physical activities. Your doctor may ask that you wear this brace off-and-on for up to 8 weeks.Your doctor may also give you a set of crutches if walking causes you pain.  A patella strap works by spreading out shock absorption around the entire knee area, so that they tendon does not do all of the work., Surgery for OSD is quite rare and used only in the most extreme cases. In adolescents, the most common sufferers of OSD, their skeleton is still forming, which makes invasive bone procedures more problematic. If your doctor does recommend surgery, consider seeking out a second opinion., In many cases, the most severe OSD symptoms will entirely disappear by the time that a person completes their adolescent growth spurt. So, at the age of 14 for girls and 16 for boys, you should see some improvement in pain levels and range of motion.While the interior of the knee will improve, be aware that your child may still have a bump present on the front of their effected knee, called a tubercle.  ","apply heat or cold. take anti-inflammatory medication. wear padded insoles and knee pads. wear a brace or cast. agree to surgery only in limited cases. expect symptoms to lessen with age. "

"What problems remained unsolved by previous research? Demonstrate why the question needs to be answered, and how it has not been answered, or has been only inadequately answered in the past.  For instance, you might write, “Livingston (2009) has demonstrated the efficacy of nucleotide reparation in E. Coli UBPs.”  , After stating the background or inspiration to the research, state your own research goals and hypotheses. This emphasizes your honesty and objectivity as a researcher up front. Be direct and succinct when stating your goals and hypotheses.  For instance, you might write, “Our hypothesis was that medication X was superior in treating epilepsy than medication Y.”  Some medical abstracts do not require a background section. In an abstract without a background section, you will start the body of your abstract with information on the goals and expectations of your research., If you utilized a common procedure or technique, simply say that you used it, do not go into great depth about the technique or procedure itself.There are several areas related to your methods that you should address, including:Setting — Where did you conduct your research?

"People have many reasons for wanting to cheat: they may be angry at their partner, feel trapped in a relationship they weren’t ready for to begin with or which has grown dull and lifeless, or be taking out frustrations about something completely unrelated to the relationship.However, there are numerous negative consequences associated with infidelity in a relationship.  You may think that you can get away with it and not get caught; even if you do, studies show that cheating partners experience high levels of shame and guilt associated with their actions. Although many couples are able to work through their issues when infidelity comes to light, many relationships dissolve from the lack of trust bred by your betrayal.Most importantly, consider the suffering your partner will experience should your infidelity come to light. If you are not willing to accept your role in their pain, don’t go through with your plans.  The repercussions of your breach of trust could follow your partner into their future relationships, negatively affecting their ability to find happiness even after they've left you behind.  Should your actions come to light, you may very well lose the respect of your friends and family, and that can be a painful consequence to live with. Try to live up to your communities expectations of you.  If you are truly unhappy in a relationship, you should have an honest conversation where you either make a plan with your partner to work together to improve it, or decide to end the relationship so you can move on with someone else.  However, if you decide to move ahead with your plans, you should take the following into consideration.;  , One of the easiest and sloppiest ways to get caught having an affair is to leave evidence of it around in easily accessible places.  Create a new email address used only to communicate with the person or people you are cheating with. Don’t tell anyone else about it or use it for anything other than your affair.  If you also use this account as a burner account for online updates or to catch spam, it will feel normalized. You want there to be a certain level of anxiety attached to this account.  This way, you will remember to log out every single time you access it.  Only write to your affair through this account, never through your regular account.  Keep your regular account logged in on your computer as you normally would, so your partner has access to it if they grow suspicious and start snooping. They won’t find anything there.  Each time you do anything online related to your affair, take a moment to clear your web browser’s history of the sites related to your affair. Note that this applies to more than just your fake email address; do this for every site related to your affair, such as Yelp reviews for a restaurant where you want to meet them, directions to a park where you’re going to meet them, reservation sites for hotels, etc.  Don’t clear your entire browser history, as this will look suspicious — nobody keeps their entire history clean.  Instead, go through your history and manually delete suspicious websites as soon as you’re finished using them.  The best way to ensure that you don’t accidentally leave any evidence of your activities behind in your browser history is to always use the “private browsing” setting when doing something you don’t want to get caught doing.  If you are using a major browser to surf the internet, you likely have a private browsing option available to you. Safari, Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and Explorerall allow you to use the internet without recording evidence of it on your computer.  Note that this does not mean you are completely anonymous while browsing. Websites still know your I.P. address visited their sites. As a result, you can see targeted ads generated from your “private” browsing session.To avoid getting caught through your targeted ads, make sure you close out all private windows every time you’re finished using them. This will delete the cookies that lead to suspicious targeted ads.  If your phone is already locked and your partner doesn’t know the code, you’re in the clear. However, if your phone isn't locked or if your partner knows the code, you need to re-secure your phone.  Create a believable explanation for why you need to suddenly secure your phone. You might say that some people at work got into it and found private pictures of you and your partner, or that they sent a string of text messages to people in your contact list.  If your partner is accustomed to knowing the code to your phone, it would be highly suspicious of you to suddenly insist on privacy. Don’t try to change the password, but don’t use your phone for any suspicious activity.  If you need to communicate with your affair through your phone, use the private browsing option on its browser to log into your “cheating” email account. Remember to log out and close the private window to delete cookies when you’re done.  If your partner sees a sudden spike in calls or texts to your affair’s phone number, this could raise suspicions. Keep phone calls brief, and text only when necessary. The majority of your communication should be conducted through your designated email account.  A prepaid cell phone would allow you to communicate with your affair freely without worrying about the charges showing up on a monthly phone bill. However, it’s highly risky because being caught with a strange, secret phone would make even the most trusting partner wonder.  If you do use a prepaid cell phone, be incredibly careful about not getting caught with it.  Have an excuse prepared just in case your partner does end up finding it. You might say that a colleague left it behind in the office and you forgot to drop it off to them on your way home, for example.  Any questionable charges — hotel rooms, out-of-town businesses — will show up on your monthly statement. Suspiciously large charges such as dinners for two at a nice restaurant might also attract attention. Whenever making purchases you don’t want to get caught making, use cash rather than card to avoid leaving a paper trail behind.  There is absolutely no reason that the amount of condoms or other birth control should fluctuate unexpectedly within a committed, monogamous relationship. Missing or extra condoms are a flaming red flag. The birth control you use outside of your relationship should be kept completely separate from that you use with your partner.  Buy separate condoms when sleeping with your affair.  Purchase small packs or individual condoms rather than boxes, so you won’t get caught with extra condoms stashed in your car.  Throw away unused condoms before returning home instead of keeping them around.  By getting mad, you’re signalling to your partner that you have a negative reaction to their accusation, rather than a bewildered one. Anger also transitions quickly into an argument, and arguments get drawn out and linger in the back of the mind. You want to avoid attaching lasting, negative memories to this conversation, and the best way to do that is to keep it from getting heated.  Don’t laugh in a mean-spirited way, and don’t make fun of your partner for having their suspicions.  Simply act surprised or bewildered by the suspicions, as though it never would have occurred to you that you were acting in a questionable way.  After your initial lighthearted reaction, you don’t want to run away from the conversation, as this might make them feel like you’re not taking their feelings seriously. That resentment can also linger and fester, so you want to address this head-on.  Tell them that you’re sorry they feel that way and that you didn’t even know that you were causing them to feel insecure in the relationship.  Allow them to voice their concerns, and be a good listener — don’t interrupt them or get defensive.  Make note of their specific suspicions, as this will let you know what mistakes you’re making.  A good partner will feel bad about making them worry, so assure them that even though they have nothing to worry about, you will make an effort to be more attentive to them.  If you let your partner speak honestly, they may have given you a list of specific concerns they have about your behaviour. If you change that behaviour without warning, it may only make them even more suspicious. However, if you have an open conversation with them about how you promise to change those behaviours, they will interpret your changed behaviours as dedication to working on your relationship.  Tripping all over yourself to completely change your behaviours might make you look like you’re overreacting or have a guilty conscience. Don’t make dramatic changes.  Simply change your behaviour enough to demonstrate that you’re making an effort to maintain trust in the relationship.  If your partner is too on-target with their suspicions, it may be time to call off the affair, or at least put it on hold until the danger passes. Even after the conversation about your partner’s fears, even after you promise to make them feel safer in the relationship, your partner may still harbour suspicion. Don’t take unnecessary risks.  ","think twice about cheating on your partner. set up a separate email address. clear browser history — but only partially. use the “private browsing” mode on your web browser. lock your cell phone. use your phone minimally. buy a prepaid cell phone. don’t use credit cards on suspicious purchases. buy separate birth control. laugh at their suspicions instead of getting mad. talk to them about their suspicions. promise to make an effort to work on those trust issues. change some of your suspicious behaviour. stop the affair or put it on hold.

"You’ll need an account to bid on items and track your purchases. Creating an account is free, and only requires a name and email address. In order to buy, you’ll need to enter contact information.;  , Search for the item or type of item you are looking for in the Search bar. If there are a lot of returns, try refining your search using the Advanced Search tool.  If you don’t know exactly what kind of item you want, you can browse eBay listings by category to see all of the items listed.  When you find the item that interests you, read the listing completely. Does it tell you everything that you need to know? Is it clear, detailed, and easy to understand? Does the listing tell you if the item is new or used? If these things are not clear, or you have questions, e-mail the seller and ask for clarification.  What the seller tells you becomes part of the sale deal and provides a reason for return if the seller misleads you. It is better to be aware of everything than to throw away money in the hope the item will live up to your expectations.  Check product listings and other web sources to ensure that what is described in the eBay listing is what you are looking for. Many products have similar models with different features, so it pays to be well-informed about the product you are looking at.  If photos are provided, look closely at them. Are there any features that stand out? If you can enlarge the photos, do so. There is also no harm in e-mailing for extra photos if desired, along with any questions you have about the images.  Pay extra attention to the condition of the item in the photos. Are they only showing the picture of the box? You should be able to see the condition of the item in detail.  This is a trap for many buyers. The item seems like a great price -- until the shipping and handling costs are factored in. If they are not displayed, e-mail for the costs to your part of the world. Also be aware that some sellers will not ship to some locations.  Overall feedback and comments are a good reflection of the seller's good faith, successful previous sales and even speed of shipping. Anything above 95% is usually an indication that the seller is good - some negative feedback is to be expected in the world of sales and may simply be a reflection of a difficult customer or someone who had expectations that were unrealistic.  Check how many transactions the seller has performed. While it may not be wrong to do business with someone with only a few transactions (they may be new!), you are more likely to receive good service from sellers that have performed a large number of sales. A seller with a lot of sales will usually process your order faster and work to ensure that you are satisfied.  PayPal is one of the most common payment methods on eBay, as payments can be processed immediately. If you don’t have a PayPal account, it is recommended that you set one up before you begin bidding to make the process smoother.  Don’t purchase from sellers who only accept cash. Avoid these sellers.  This will give you the average prices paid for the item in the past which lets you make a comparison and gives you a notion whether the 'Buy It Now' price or the auction listing prices are fair or not. If you are bidding, as opposed to buying immediately, it gives you an indication of how much you should be willing to bid.  You can perform a Completed Listings search by clicking the 'Advanced' link next to the search bar. Check the 'Completed listings' box in the 'Search including' section. Enter in your search keywords and then click the Search button.  Listings in red will be completed listings.  The “Buy it Now” option allows you to purchase the item for a set price instead of having to go through the bidding process. For rarer items, using the “Buy it Now” option may actually save you money if a bidding war starts.  Be sure to check the average price for the item you are purchasing. If you use the “Buy it Now” option, you may end up paying more than it’s worth.  Your bid will automatically increase by the minimum bidding interval until you reach the maximum amount you entered. This will allow you to set a maximum that you’re comfortable with without having to constantly monitor the auction.  Placing any bid binds you to the auction. By placing the bid, you are agreeing to pay the amount that the auction closes at.  You cannot retract bids, so be sure that you are sure that you want the item. Bids can only be retracted if there was an error in entering a bid to begin with, not if you change your mind on an item.  As the auction progresses, you will be notified if your maximum amount has been outbid. If you can and want to, you can increase the amount of your bid by returning to the listing and entering in a new amount.  If you win the item, you will be notified. Once the auction ends, you are obligated to get in touch with the seller and work out payment and shipping details., Once the auction is complete and you have declared the winner, you and the seller need to get in touch. This communication will allow you to choose your payment method and confirm your shipping address and the shipping and handling fees. The seller will ship the item once they receive confirmation that payment has been made.  If the seller does not receive payment within two days of the auction ending, they can open a case against you through eBay. You can avoid this by quickly paying for your item as soon as the auction is completed.  Paying quickly will often result in the seller leaving good feedback for you, which will make future sellers more likely to quickly work with you.  The entire eBay system revolves around buyers and sellers leaving feedback for each other after the completion of a transaction. Leaving feedback for sellers after a transaction is considered good etiquette. Use the feedback to let other buyers know if the seller is reliable. Feedback options include:  Positive: You are satisfied with the transaction and would likely buy from that seller again.  Neutral: You may have some issues with the sale process but not enough to leave a negative.  Negative: Something about the sale disappointed or upset you. Before leaving negative feedback, always try to contact the seller and seek resolution. Most sellers will try to remedy any errors that they have caused because they value their feedback status. Many now offer refunds and in some cases, you may be able to reach a compromise that makes both sides happy. If you cannot reach a resolution, eBay can also intervene for you. After trying a reasonable amount to resolve the issue and you still have no happy outcome, leave a factual message as to why you found the transaction to be negative. Avoid abuse or inflammatory statements; these reflect badly on you and may cause future sellers to block you.  If you have troubles with receiving the item from the seller, receiving an item in a different condition than was advertised, or have any other issues, contact the eBay Resolution Center. You can use this online tool to file a complaint, and potentially receive a refund from eBay for the purchase you made.  Always try to resolve your issue with the seller directly before using the Resolution Center. Most good sellers will attempt to make things right without having to escalate to eBay customer service.

"It can be any color and any thickness you think will look good with your toy. You may find you prefer cotton yarn or string, so that it isn't too stretchy.  , Hammocks dangle down, so make the chain longer than the toy. This chain will form one side of the finished hammock. In this example, there are 108 chain stitches at this point., There are now 118 stitches in the example.  The first eight and the last ten stitches will form the loops at either end, which is why they're listed separately.  ,,, Chain 5, slip stitch into every fifth stitch, until you have the original 8 stitches remaining.  Don't worry if you don't find exactly eight stitches here. Just try to leave more than five and fewer than ten.  Slip stitch to join in the first stitch of the original chain., This will start the third row., Slip stitch into the third stitch from the chain of five that forms the loop you're over., The last loop will be different.,, Chain eight and join in the third chain from the last slip stitch in the previous row., Chain eight and turn.,  A straighter edge.  This matches the very first edge and makes the edge a bit straighter and tighter.  Loop around and join to the corner of the fabric with a slip stitch. Tie off and sew in the ends. This produces a final loop for the corner., This will tell you how many holes you will drill in the dowel and how far apart to drill them. This hammock will have holes every half inch. The fabric is stretchy, so the interval between the holes can be approximate, but the number of holes must be correct.,  This is a 7/16' dowel with 1/8' holes every 1/2', but use whatever size and spacing seems right for your fabric.  Drill the holes larger than you will need for just the yarn or string. It will make it much easier to assemble and hang the hammock.  Also do any sanding that the dowels or the corners require. Jagged edges on the dowels will catch on the string. If you wish to apply any sort of finish to the dowels, do that now, too, and give the finish ample time to soak in and dry before proceeding., Leave the strings long so that you have leftover length.  It will help to hold the opposite end firmly. Here, it's wrapped around the other dowel and weighed down with books and things.  Repeat for each loop and each hole., Center the bundle over the middle string if there are an odd number of loops or between the two middle strings if there are an even number of loops. Pull the strings gently so that they all have approximately even tension when the bundle is held in the middle.  It's important to get everything centered and even here so that the finished hammock will balance.  When gathering the second end, measure the distance along the middle string from the edge of the fabric to where you are holding the bundle and tying it.  , For the one shown here, divide the strings into three (or more) groups and braid them. Wrap the loose ends of the braid back around the base of the braid. Tie another knot.

"Do a sketch first to make sure you like the writing or design style. The good news about drawing with a hot glue gun is if you don’t like it, you can wipe away the hot glue immediately (you may have to peel it off if it dries)., You want to make sure your glue gun is red hot before use.  It may be a little difficult to see the actual writing or design since the glue is transparent. Consider creating your design in a well lit area so you can see exactly what you are doing.  Allow ample dry time for the glue gun design. Even allowing it to set for up to 24 hours is a good idea as painting over the wet glue could ruin your project.  Cover surfaces with newspaper and make sure the room is well ventilated. Consider completing the project outdoors if possible.  Make sure your spray is even and fully covers the object. You may want to add a few coats of paint depending on the type of surface and item.  Allow paint to dry before adding the item to your room décor.  ","decide what you want to write or draw. heat up the hot glue gun and insert a wax stick. draw/write your design on your item. prepare an area for spray painting. paint the object. finished. "
"Inserting foreign words into English sentences helps with quickly learning the meaning of each word. This technique is known as diglot weave . Come up with different sentences and replace one word at a time with a Latin vocabulary word leaving the rest of the sentence in English. Repeat this, replacing different words within the sentence, until you’ve mastered each word.  Place a label on the things that are around (wall, window, chair, computer, etc.) with a Post-It note of the word and its meaning on opposite sides. Read both sides of the label until you’ve committed it to memory.  When you’ve memorized the word, remove and gather the Post-It notes. Match each vocabulary word with its item.  Practice daily and revise your labeled notes with different items. Whenever you walk past a Post-It note, test yourself.  The easiest way to remember what you’ve learned is by teaching and sharing with others. Strike up conversations with those around you. Insert the words that you’ve learned into those conversations. Use the diglot weave technique if you’re still working on forming complete sentences.  ","incorporate vocabulary words into english sentences. label the items around you. teach friends and family. "
"Lending money to friends can really put a friendship at risk.If your friend takes too long in paying the money back, you may hesitate to ask for it and the person might start believing the loan was a gift. If you do not think your friendship (or pocketbook) can withstand an unpaid loan, break the news as gently as possible to your friend. Remember to be as honest as you can.  For example, you could say to your friend, 'I know you are in a tight spot financially. I really value our friendship, but friends and loans just do not get along. Is there some other way I can help out?” Or, “I just don’t have the extra cash myself to lend. If I could give you the money, I would.”  , If you know you won't be supporting a donation request, express the importance of the request, turn it down, and give an alternative, if you can.For example, 'It sounds like you're working on a great cause, but I just can't work it in right now. I've already pledged my monthly donation funds. You might try x business or ask me again next month.'  Don't feel obligated to donate to every request. Chances are, you're focusing on your time, business, or finances. Say yes to projects that you really can or want to commit to., Most kids don't like just being told not to do something. If your child wants something that you're not going to give or allow, firmly say no and explain why you're not allowing it. Make sure to express their point of view and then suggest something that they can have or can do.For example, you might say, 'No, you can't spend the night at your friend's house during the school week. I don't want you to be too tired for class the next day. I know you're frustrated, but you can always spend the night over the weekend.'  , Never feel obligated when someone asks you for a huge favor. After all, the person probably has no idea what your work or stress load is currently like. You have the choice to say no, even to a personal favor. If the person is a good enough friend, she should understand and not press you.For example, you might say, 'I really wish I could babysit for you this week, but I've got a really big work deadline and a family obligation.' Be clear and honest. Don't lie, which could hurt your relationship in the long run.  Be direct and clear to make sure the other person gets the message. In romantic situations, people tend to take any ambiguity as a sign of hope, which isn't fair or pleasant for anyone involved. Polite ways to be blunt include 'You're (a good friend / a nice guy), but I'm not interested in you that way,' or, 'We're not quite a match.'If you just went on the date and have been asked to go on another one, you should be as honest, but gentle as you can. Try saying something like, 'I enjoyed this evening, but I don't think you and I are a good fit.'  Cut the conversation short once you've turned someone down. Most likely, neither of you will be happy trying to spend time together immediately afterward.  If a romantic partner is pressuring you to start having sex, or act more intimate than you are comfortable with, firmly decline with a straightforward 'No.' If necessary, mention a reason, such as the chance of pregnancy, your moral beliefs, or simply that you will make the decision on your own schedule. Let the other person know that this is your personal decision, and has nothing to do with his or her attractiveness.Don't assume that your partner will pick up on your lack of enthusiasm and simply stop. You need to be clear.  If you're being repeatedly hounded to go on a date or start having sex, it's time to be extra firm. If someone doesn't listen to your polite responses, another firm 'No' is necessary. Here are some examples of followup responses to try:  Say, 'I'm uncomfortable with your constant asking, so I'm going to have to say no.'  Tell your friend or partner that the behavior is making you sad or upset.  Turn down requests to spend time together.  Don't get invested in the opinion of a stranger or acquaintance. If you can, stop seeing the person completely.  First, thank him or her, and say that you're honored to be asked by such a wonderful person. Say you're not going to accept, but it's not because of anything he or she did. Finally, offer a full explanation of why you are turning down the proposal, including all the specifics in your situation.  This advice applies to someone in a serious relationship with you. If someone you only started dating proposes, gently say 'That's sweet, but it's way too early.'  If someone proposes to you in public, prevent embarrassment by keeping the moment short and sweet. Try 'I love you, and I want to talk about it in private.' Don't create a big scene or dramatic refusal.  ","refuse to lend someone money. refuse to donate. tell your kids no. turn down a big favor. turn down a date. turn down sex. handle persistent requests. turn down a marriage proposal. "
"When first starting to play an instrument, you should consider renting to be certain that you enjoy it enough to purchase.  If you're sure you are going to enjoy it, rent-to-own or buying are good options. If you are taking lessons, it's a good idea to consult with your teacher about the right type of flute for you.  Flutes can cost from 100 to 1000+ dollars, but good quality student flutes sell at around the 500-700 dollar mark. Beginners should get an open-hole student flute that has removable plugs. Over time the student should remove plugs. The flute produces a better sound as the vibration hit skin than plastic. Try to research and purchase/rent a reputable brand, as many cheap flutes are poorly made, and hard to play as a result. You can also rent a flute from a a music store that is recommended by your music teacher.  Also some flutes have an extra key at the end. This is called the B foot flute. It is slightly longer. When a flute player becomes more advance, they should think to purchase a step up flute with a b foot.  Expensive, professional flutes are for more experienced flute players. These can range from 1000-10,000+. These tend to be hand made with different precious metals added on. Including gold, platinum and the most common silver. This is for players that want a career in music.  Before you buy, get some advice from other players and/or teachers to help select the right instrument for you.;  , Ask your band director or a music shop employee about it (towards the beginning of the school year, if you are in school). This resource will be very useful as you learn to play and advance to higher levels.  Before you can play your flute, you will need to learn how to assemble it. You can do so as follows:  The flute has 3 parts. The top part is the headjoint and has the mouthpiece or lip-plate. The part with most of the keys is called the Body at the top of the body (where the headjoint goes into) is called the barrel or tenon, and the end is called the footjoint.  When putting the parts together one must be very careful to not grab the rods and keys of the flute. This can bend the rods and keys and cause the flute to not function properly.  First put the foot joint on by holding the barrel of the flute. Hold the end of the foot joint where you are not grabbing the keys and then do a twist and push motion, and the footjoint should slide right on! Now align the rods of of the footjoint to the middle of the keys of the body  , It is the same thing, grab the barrel and the headjoint. (don't grab the mouthpiece! you can bend it!) Same motion, twist and push. Now align the bore (or the mouth hole) to be aligned with the first key of the body.  !!!This is for beginners!!! The top of the flute is called the cap.Which holds and adjusts the cork. This adjusts the tuning of the flute. Do NOT keep twisting it and DO NOT take off and take cork out! If you feel the flute is out of tune ask a teacher or someone who works at an instrument store.  For those who do not have a lesson teacher and would like to check if the cork is in the correct position take your cleaning rod and flip it around. The bottom of the rod should have a etched line, stick this into the headjoint and look in the hole of the mouthpiece the etched line should be right in the middle.  At first, producing a sound from your flute can be a little tricky, so you should practice the correct blowing method first, before you attempt to play any specific notes.  BREATHING!! This is one of the most important aspects of playing the flute! Keep your shoulders relaxed and head up, breath from your stomach. By that, just imagine a string pulling from your belly button. Ladies especially young ladies. Your stomach is going to stick out, but this is the correct way to breath.  Deep breaths, not shallow!  Don't just blow, one must have the correct embouchure to play correctly. Think of spitting out a sunflower seed! Try it! Try it again and freeze after you spit the seed out. That is how small the hole of your mouth needs to be while you blow. Now, say the word 'poo' and freeze your face. This is the general facial position. Now add those 2 together and you now have the right embouchure to play.  Now onto making a sound. Blow across the mouthpiece like blowing across a bottle. The sound is produced by the breaking of your airstream on the edge of the embouchure hole. Half your breath should travel above the hole, and half should travel down through the flute.  Try to keep the corner of your lips firm but not tight!! You will know when they are too tight when you practice and the corners of your mouth is tired and sore. Remember to say 'poo'. This keeps your corner relaxed yet firm!  , Hold the flute with your mouth on the embouchure (lip hole) and the remainder of the instrument pointing to your right hand side, in a horizontal fashion.  Lets start with the right hand. Shake your hand out and let it relax naturally by your side. Bring it up it should be naturally curved. Now make a duck/dinosaur. Notice where you thumb rests naturally on your hand. Some thumb rest between the pointer finger and middle, or under the pointer finger, or under the middle. Just make note of where YOUR thumb lands. Now, open the 'mouth' and feed it your flute. Remember where you thumb landed naturally? Well place it on your flute and you fingers should be hover above. Now place your pointer finger down on the first key this will be called 1, the next key is where you middle finger is placed, this is 2, you ring finger is the next key, this is 3, and you pinky will rest on this flat half circle key. 9 times out of 10 this pinky will be pressed down and you learn different notes and fingerings.  The left hand is the awkward position. Same as the right hand shake it out and let it drop naturally to the side. Then bring it up and make the duck/dinosaur, then turn the duck/dinosaur to face you. Open the 'mouth' and feed your hand the flute. Rest your thumb on the circle thumb key (for now, the rectangle key is also a thumb key it is the B natural key, you will learn this as you get a fingering chart) Now skip the top key and place you pointer finger on the second key, this is called 1 as well. Skip the next key and then place you middle finger down that is 2, and you ring finger goes on the key next to your middle finger, that is called 3. Now you pinky will hover over the key sticking out of you flute.  Keep you LH pinky hovering over the key! Get into this habit, don't let hang below or press down. As you learn fingerings you will press this key for certain notes.Bear in mind that this finger placement will feel awkward and unnatural at first. This is completely normal. With practice, it will begin to feel more normal.  In order to learn how to play specific notes on the flute, you should consult a fingering chart, which will guide you through the finger placement for each note.  Fingering charts make use of pictures and diagrams, which make it easier to visualize the finger placement for each individual note. Most instruction books for the flute will contain a fingering chart, but it is also easy to find these charts online.Practice playing each note until you get it sounding just right. When playing a note on the flute it should not sound like you're just blowing or whistling - it should be a full, steady tone.  Once you have mastered playing each note individually, you can practice playing multiple notes in a row. It doesn't matter if it doesn't sound very musical - the point of the exercise is to learn how to transition smoothly from one note to the next.  It is essential that you maintain the correct posture while playing the flute, as this will allow you to improve your air capacity and produce more consistent tones.  Stand or sit up as straight as possible, with your chin raised and your eyes looking straight ahead. This opens up your body and allows you to produce clearer, longer notes.  Stand with your two feet planted on the ground and the left foot slightly in front of the right. Your body should be at an angle, this is a more natural position then being body facing straight ahead, your shoulders will not be in a awkward position when read music. You want most of the weight on the right foot/back foot. Try not to stick your hip out too much or have weird angles with your neck, and back.This will only lead to tension and pain, which will interfere with your practice.  Remember to keep your body relaxed and avoid tensing up as you play - this will help you to produce a smoother, richer sound.  If you're using a music stand, make sure you keep it at eye level. If the stand is too low down it will cause you to bend your neck and tuck your chin, which will restrict your airways and cause neck pain., Perfect Practice makes perfect, as the music saying goes. But keep in mind that it's much better to practice for short periods everyday, than to cram all of your practice into a two-hour weekly session. As you get more advance start to increase your practice time.  Make your practice goal-oriented, as this will help you to remain focused. Keep these goals small but concrete. For example, aim to perfect the transition from a B to an A note.  Practicing in infrequent, marathon sessions is inefficient as it overtaxes the body, leaving you feeling stiff and frustrated. You will notice much greater improvement and less stiffness if you practice consistently everyday and increasing your time., You should always stretch after your practice session as it will relieve tension and prevent stiffness after playing, leaving you in better shape for your next practice session. Some good exercises are as follows:  Bend your knees slightly and crouch down with your arms extended behind you, as if skiing. Then swing your arms upwards as if you intended to fly away. Repeat 5-10 times to stretch out the arms and shoulders.  While inhaling, draw your shoulders upwards towards your ears and hold in this position for several seconds. Release your shoulders downwards as you exhale. Repeat several times to release tension and pain in the shoulders and neck.  Stand with your hands down by your sides and shake your arms and hands as if they were made out of rubber. This will help to loosen the joints in the arms and hands.  There are many other stretches you can do to relieve any tension or aches - just do what feels right for you!  , Learning to play the flute takes a while. Some go for months without making a sound, so don't get discouraged if you can't make one when you first get it. Be patient, keep practicing, and get the assistance of a good teacher. Soon you'll be making beautiful music!  , Thread a silky swab through the top or purchase a cleaning flute flag, this is to remove condensation from the inside of your flute. Occasionally polish it with a cloth. Make sure it isn't silver polish. A simple microfiber cloth is all you need.  Never leave your cleaning swab inside you flute, this will cause the moisture to ruin the pads of your flute. You wouldn't leave your wet dirty sock in your sneakers would you? No. The same thing with your cleaning rod.  Take your flute apart the same way you put it together. Grab the tenon and twist and pull the headjoint and the foot joint grab the tenon and the bottom of the footjoint and twist and pull. Put each piece back into the flute case where it belongs!  Now take your cleaning rod/flag and swab the inside of each piece and place back into case.

"Relying on excuses to get you out of homework isn’t a good plan for the long-term. If you find yourself frequently forgetting or otherwise not doing your homework, you need a better game-plame.  Start by writing down every assignment and its due date as soon as it’s assigned.  Be sure to write all of your assignments down in the same place so you don’t miss any or have to go on a desperate search every time you want to know what’s due. A day planner, dedicated homework notebook, or scheduling app are all good options.  Know when your assignments are due and have a schedule in place that will help you complete each assignment by its due date.  Whenever you get an assignment, estimate how long it will take to complete and set aside the necessary time accordingly.  If it’s an assignment that will take several days or even several weeks, set aside as many blocks of time as you’ll need to complete it over that span of time.  Set aside a period of time to do homework each night. Preferably make it at the same time every night so it becomes part of your routine.  Don’t procrastinate on homework--don’t let yourself play video games or chat on Facebook until you’ve finished your night’s assignments.  Do the harder assignments first. Getting the harder work out of the way first is a more efficient and rewarding use of your time.  If you find yourself struggling to finish all of your homework because of time constraints, use small bits of down time to help you make more of a dent in your work.  If you have a study-hall period, a free period, a few minutes between classes, a 10-15 minute bus ride home, etc., use that time to work on homework. Sure, you’d rather be talking to friends or playing on your phone, but if you want to have your homework done, you’ll need to actually take the time to do it., If you find yourself getting bogged down by homework or can’t get the assignments done because you’re struggling to understand the subject matter, ask for help.  Start by approaching the teacher. Explain your difficulties and ask for their help. That’s what your teachers are there for, after all--to help you learn. (And if they show any reluctance to help, remind them of this fact.) They’re the best source of help since they’re the ones making and grading the homework, and having the help of an insider is often invaluable.  Get help from a classmate. If your teacher isn’t able to give as much help as you need, supplement their help with help from a classmate who understands the material and is doing well in the class. If you aren’t sure who that might be, ask your teacher for suggestions.  Get a tutor. Many schools offer free peer-tutoring services that can be a significant help. Ask your teacher or an administrator whether such services are available. If not, consider looking into hiring a tutor. There are a number of professional tutoring services to choose from, or you might try hiring a local college student for tutoring help.  Like it or not, studying requires focus and concentration. Consequently, a large part of not getting homework done has to do with distractions.Even if you think you’re a great multi-tasker, trying to do homework while also texting, catching up on Facebook, and tweeting about how much you hate homework is actually hurting you more than helping you get through the process.  Moreover, though multitasking can be an asset for some activities, it isn’t an asset when studying. When you’re multitasking, your mind leaves your current train of thought (like, say, trigonometry) and takes up a new train (maybe texting a friend about tomorrow’s plans), and the result is that you end up doing worse on both.  Find a quiet, distraction-free space to do your studying. The better you’re able to concentrate, the better you’ll do on your work and the more quickly you’ll get through it. Put away or turn off anything you know will distract you (your phone, Facebook alerts, whatever).If you find yourself being distracted by thoughts of other things you should or want to be doing, keep a piece of paper next to you where you can write down those thoughts as they come up. Don’t dwell on them, just write them down and know you can get back to them later.Set small goals and reward yourself when you achieve them. For example, set a goal to study for 15-20 minutes straight and then reward yourself with a small treat when you do so.  ","make a homework game-plan. have a homework schedule. make homework a routine. use free or in-between times to do homework. ask for help. cut out distractions. "
"Different vaccines generally need to be given at different times in a chicken’s life. Most vaccines are given soon after the chicks have hatched. Always talk to a veterinarian before vaccinating if you have never vaccinated a chicken before.Listed below is a general guide for the most common vaccinations and when they should be given:  E.Coli: Given at one day-old.  Marek’s Disease: Given at a day-old to 3 weeks of age.  Infectious Bursal Disease (Gumboro disease): Given from 10 – 28 days old.  Infectious Bronchitis: Given at 16 – 20 weeks of age.  Newcastle Disease: Given at 16 – 20 weeks of age.  Adenovirus: Given at 16 – 20 weeks of age.  Salmonellosis: Given at day old to 16 weeks of age.  Coccidiosis: Given at day-old to 9 days.  Infectious Laryngotracheitis: From 4 weeks of age on.;  ,  Most vaccine manufacturers recommend giving vaccinations to adult birds at least 4 weeks before the hen starts laying. This ensures that the recipient is no longer shedding virus and does not therefore pose a risk of indirect transmission via the egg to birds at a different location.  Some vaccines need an annual booster shot to make sure that they are still effectively guarding against the virus they are designed to fight. Other vaccines only need to be given once and will provide lifelong protection.Vaccines that need an annual booster: Infectious Bronchitis, Newcastle Disease, Adenovirus (Egg Drop Syndrome), Salmonella.  Vaccines that do not need a booster: Marek’s Disease, Infectious Bursal Disease, Coccidiosis, Infectious Laryngotracheitis  , You do not want to vaccinate sick birds, as the virus might be too strong and may kill them. The best way to tell if you should vaccinate or not is to have a veterinarian inspect the chickens to make sure they are healthy.  At the same time, the veterinarian can talk to you about the best way to vaccinate your specific chickens.  It is very important that you check to make sure you have the right vaccine, right dosage, and understand the best way to give the chicken that vaccine. Double check you have all of the correct information and write down all of the information, including:  Vaccine name.  Lot number.  Manufacturer.  Production date.  Expiration date.  Which chicken is receiving what vaccine.  If the vaccine is supposed to be stored at a specific temperature or in a specific location, it is important to check that the storage has not been compromised in any way.  If you notice any cracks, or the temperature is not at the right level, you will have to cancel the vaccination and order another round of the vaccine through your veterinarian.  The following sections in this article discuss different ways you can vaccinate your chicken. Each method can only be applied to specific kinds of vaccinations so you should always make sure you are doing the right kind of procedure. Once you have double checked that you know what you are doing, gather all of your materials so you can have them on hand when you are vaccinating the chickens.  Some vaccination methods require that you have one or two other people helping you so assemble a team if this is the case with your vaccination method.  If you are planning on using a syringe and needle to get the chicken her vaccination, you should sterilize the spot where you plan to do it. To sterilize the skin soak a cotton wool ball in surgical spirit (such as rubbing alcohol), part the feathers over the injection site and swab the skin.  ","give chicks their first vaccinations at the right time. do not give vaccines to chickens who are laying eggs.the risk of the virus being shed via the oviduct into the egg, and then taken off site where it could pose an infection risk to other birds, is too high when you vaccinate chickens while they are laying eggs. be aware of which vaccines need to be given annually. check the overall health of your chickens before you vaccinate. check and record the vaccination information. double check that the vaccine has been stored correctly. gather all of your materials. sterilize the spot where you plan to inject the vaccination.

"There are many different herbs that are known to be effective for treating headaches when brewed in teas. Peppermint, chamomile, skullcap, and feverfew are all examples of herbs that can be used in teas to help soothe and relieve headaches. Feverfew is particularly known for keeping headaches at bay, more so than treating them once they’ve already begun. You can try taking feverfew in a capsule each morning if headaches are a regular issue for you.Ginger root tea is also a great option for helping relieve headache pain.  Some health stores may carry pre-made herbal blends that contain various combinations of these herbs, made specifically for soothing headaches. Talk to an associate at your local health food store if you need help picking out a pre-made tea blend.  A simple drop or two of rosemary or thyme essential oils can help soothe a headache. Put a drop of one of these oils onto your fingertips, and gently rub the oil into your temples. Let the oil sit on your skin for a few minutes after you’ve finished massaging your temples. Try this remedy in a quiet, relaxed space.If you find your skin becomes irritated from the oils, try mixing them with a carrier oil such as jojoba, olive, or coconut oil before applying the blend to your temples.  Adding a magnesium supplement to your daily routine may help you stave off future headaches. Studies have shown that those suffering from migraines actually have lowered magnesium levels in their brains as they endure a migraine, so keeping your magnesium levels up might help prevent headaches from coming on in the first place.You can also try eating foods that are high in magnesium, like pumpkin seeds, bananas, broccoli, almonds, and cashews., Simple foot baths have been widely used in naturopathic and holistic medicine to treat headaches. Find a bowl or container large enough for both of your feet to fit in and be fully submerged in water. Fill the bowl with hot water. While holding a cold compress or ice pack against the back of your neck, place your feet in the bowl of hot water. This draws your blood down towards your feet, which can help relax the blood vessels in your head that are causing the pain.  ","experiment with other herbal teas. rub essential oils into your temples. take a magnesium supplement. try a foot bath. "
"Regular expressions are normally used for one of the following:  Check if a string has a certain pattern within it  Validate a string against a pattern  Replace a specific pattern with another pattern  Split a string using a pattern delimiter  Find all occurrences of a certain pattern within a string  Extract pattern pieces/groups from a string (like in syntax checking/highlighting);  , Visit an online library of regular expressions, The setting you need to decide are:  Case sensitivity of matching  Whether you want to ignore any white spaces within the regular expression while matching or not  Whether the matching is multi-line or not (this changes the meaning of ^ and $ to match to the beginning and end of lines and not only the beginning and end of the whole string)  The direction of the matching process (left-to-right or right-to-left)  Whether . will match any character including or not including new line  Whether to compile the regular expression to the assembly (slow start up, fast processing) or not (the contrary)  Whether to ignore culture variance/change or not  Whether to use ECMA Script compliant mode or not  Whether to capture every group (any sub-expression within parenthesis) or only groups that are named  ,, This depends on your choice in step 1. You have the following choices:  Is Match() - if you only need to check whether a match was found or not  Match() - if you want to get the first match found. Calling this method again will get the next match and so on.  Matches() - if you want to retrieve all matches of the pattern in one call  Split() - if you want to split the string at the matches of the pattern  Replace() - if you want to replace the matches of the pattern with another pattern or string  , Static methods do not require the creation of a Regex object but they do not keep the status of matching between calls. According to your choice, follow the following steps:  For static versions of the methods:  Declare an appropriate reference to hold the results of the operation if necessary. Here is a list of the methods and the type of results they return:  Is Match() - bool  Match() - Match  Matches() - Match Collection  Replace() - string  Split() - string[]  Call the appropriate method from the Regex class passing it the regular expression, the string, the options, and the replacement pattern in case of Replace() and assign the result to the reference you declared in the previous step.  For instance versions of the methods:  Create a Regex object passing the regular expression you created, and the matching options to the constructor.  Declare an appropriate result reference to hold the results obtained (like step 1 in the static version of the method)  Call the method you choose from the regex object passing it the string to be matched and assign the result to the reference created in the previous step.  Usual uses of results are listed below in the 'Common Uses of Regex Methods Results' section  ","decide the specific use of regular expressions you need. design and decide the regular expression you want to use. decide the regular expressions matching options you want to use.create a regexoptions object and add all options (by using bit-wise or '|') - this step is optional , choose the member method you want to use. decide whether you want to use the static version of the method or the instance version. use the results obtained at the end of step 6 in the rest of your code.

"When you bring your cat in, you'll need to give information about the cat's symptoms, particularly when the cat started exhibiting the problem. You also should note if you saw anything that could have caused the problem, such as an injury. If your cat has been exposed to ticks, you should note that as well., The vet will begin with a physical exam, where they will check your cat from nose to tail, focusing on the problem area. Often the vet may need to gently restrain the cat to examine it., The vet will need to perform these tests to help narrow down the problem. The vet may take blood and urine samples to be sent for testing. The vet may also take an x-ray to see if the problem is physical (in the spine).The vet may also take CT scans or MRIs or perform a biopsy.  If the cat has experienced trauma, then the vet will likely assume the condition is related, and diagnostic tests like x-rays will help the vet see the nature of the injury. Similarly, it could be a back problem, such as a slipped disc or a blood clot, which an x-ray will also help determine.  For other problems, such as diabetic problems and tick poisoning, blood and urine tests will help narrow down the issue. If your vet suspects a or finds a tumor, they'll likely use a biopsy to tell if it is benign.  When a cat is first having problems in its back legs, a hospital visit is likely in order, especially if the cat is having trouble doing things like going to the bathroom. In the hospital, the vet can observe and diagnose the cat.  ","give a medical history. prepare for a physical exam. expect diagnostic tests. understand hospitalization may be necessary. "
"You can make beautiful magnets out of clay and rubber stamps. Paper clay dries white, making it the perfect surface to paint on. It also dries lightweight, so it won't slide down the door of the fridge. Here's a list of what you will need: Air dry paper clay  Rolling pin  Cookie cutters or craft knife  Rubber stamps  Ink pad (optional)  Clear acrylic sealer  Round button magnet  Hot glue or industrial strength glue  , You don't want to make it too thin or too thick, or it may crack while it dries. Paper clay is great, because it dries very lightweight.  You will be punching out shapes later. This is to give the shapes some texture and design. You can use ornate designs, such as damask and scrolls. You can also use pictures or symbols, such as a cat, dog, heart, or star.  If you want your design to be colored, then press your rubber stamp into a colored ink pad first. The color will transfer to the clay, along with your design.You can also use ornate buttons or brooches to stamp designs.  You can make any shape you want, but simpler shapes (such as circles and squares) might show off your design better.  Depending on how dry or humid it is, this can take several hours or overnight.  If the cookie cutters didn't cut clean, you can smooth the edges down with some sandpaper.  You can paint it using some watercolor paints or acrylic paints. Watercolor paints will give you a sheer finish, and acrylic paints will give you a more opaque finish. Allow the paint to dry before moving on.  The clay will dry matte, but if you use a glossy sealer, you will get a glazed look. Seal the front first and let it dry before sealing the back. This will help your piece last longer. It will also prevent the magnet from peeling off.  You can spray it with a clear acrylic spray sealer. You can also apply some Mod Podge over it instead using a paintbrush or a foam brush.  You can use hot glue or an industrial strength glue.  Hot glue sets quickly, but industrial strength glues require several hours to dry and cure. Refer to the label on your glue as each brand is a little different.  ","gather your supplies. roll out some air dry paper clay until it is about 5 mm thick. use a rubber stamp to imprint some designs into the clay. use a cookie cutter or a craft knife to cut shapes into your clay. let the clay dry. use a fine-grit sandpaper to buff away any ragged edges. consider painting your piece. seal the front and back of your clay piece. glue a round magnet to the back of your clay piece. allow the glue to dry before you use your magnet.
